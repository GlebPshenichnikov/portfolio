Here's how to make perfume at home.\n\nKnow the different notes.\n\nPerfume is made up of three primary notes: top, middle, and base. Top notes are the first scent you experience when you apply perfume and typically last for a couple of hours. Middle notes are the scent that becomes noticeable after the top notes fade and can last up to five hours. Base notes are the longest-lasting and form the foundation of the scent.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with popular top notes.\n\nThe most popular top notes for perfume include citrus (such as lemon or bergamot), floral (such as rose or jasmine), and fruity (such as apple or peach).\n\nFamiliarize yourself with popular middle notes.\n\nThe most popular middle notes for perfume include spicy (such as cinnamon or pepper), herbal (such as lavender or sage), and floral (such as rose or ylang-ylang).\n\nFamiliarize yourself with popular base notes.\n\nThe most popular base notes for perfume include woody (such as cedar or sandalwood), musky (such as musk or amber), and earthy (such as patchouli or vetiver).\n\nKnow the ratios.\n\nTo create a balanced perfume, you'll want to use the following ratio of notes:\n\n- Top notes: 15-30%\n- Middle notes: 30-60%\n- Base notes: 15-30%\n\nKnow the basic recipe.\n\nTo make perfume, you'll need:\n\n- Essential oils\n- Carrier oil (such as jojoba or sweet almond oil)\n- Alcohol (at least 90% proof)\n- Bottled water\n\nFind out what notes your favorite perfumes contain.\n\nSmell your favorite perfumes and try to identify the notes that are used. This will give you an idea of what kind of scents you enjoy and what you might want to include in your homemade perfume.\n\nBuy dark glass containers.\n\nPerfume is sensitive to light, so it's best to use dark glass containers to store your homemade perfume.\n\nBuy a carrier oil.\n\nA carrier oil is used to dilute the essential oils and helps the perfume last longer on your skin.\n\nBuy the strongest alcohol you can find.\n\nA high-proof alcohol is necessary to help preserve the perfume and ensure that it lasts longer.\n\nSelect your scents.\n\nChoose the essential oils you want to use for your perfume and mix different scents together to create a fragrance that you love.\n\nDecide on a method.\n\nThere are two methods for making perfume: infusion and blending. Infusion involves letting plant materials soak in oil for several weeks, while blending involves mixing essential oils with alcohol and water.\n\nObtain a clean glass container.\n\nMake sure your glass container is clean and free of any debris or residue.\n\nObtain an odorless oil.\n\nUsing an odorless oil will not interfere with the scent of your essential oils.\n\nCollect flowers, leaves, or herbs whose scent appeals to you.\n\nChoose plant materials that you enjoy the scent of and that you want to include in your perfume.\n\nRemove any unwanted plant materials.\n\nRemove any stems, leaves, or debris from your plant materials.\n\nBruise the plant materials lightly.\n\nLightly bruising your plant materials will help release their fragrance.\n\nPour some oil into the glass container.\n\nFill the container about halfway with your carrier oil.\n\nAdd the plant materials to the oil and shut the lid.\n\nMake sure the plant materials are fully submerged in the oil and seal the lid tightly.\n\nLet the jar sit in a cool, dark place for one to two weeks.\n\nShake the jar every day to help release the fragrance.\n\nOpen, strain and repeat.\n\nAfter one to two weeks, open the jar and strain out the plant materials.

{"text":"How to Convert Song Lyrics to a Song'\n\nConverting your song lyrics into a full-fledged song can be an exciting and fulfilling experience. Whether you're an aspiring singer, songwriter, or musician, creating a song from scratch can be both challenging and rewarding.\n\nIf you've already got your song lyrics written, then the next step is to put those lyrics into a musical context. This article will guide you through the process of converting your song lyrics to a song, step-by-step.\n\n1. Think of the tempo of your song.\n\nTempo refers to the pacing of your song. Think about how fast or slow you want the song to be. This will help you determine the rhythm and structure of your song.\n\n2. Consider what style of music the song should be.\n\nWhat kind of genre or style do you want to write your song in? Is it pop, rock, hip-hop, or country? This will help you determine the overall sound and vibe you want for your song.\n\n3. Experiment with similar music.\n\nListen to songs from your preferred genre or style. This will help you get a better idea of what kind of sound you're aiming for. Take note of the chords, melody, and structure of the songs you listen to. This can help you come up with an idea for your own song.\n\n4. One thing to keep in mind before you go to the next step is that although most of the music you've listened to is probably intricately made and thought out by brilliant musical minds (especially if you've listened to bands such as Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones), some of the best music is made up of simple segments arranged in the right way (think more of the Ramones or Nirvana).\n\n5. Start thinking about the music you can put to your own lyrics.\n\nNow that you have a better idea of what kind of sound you're aiming for, start thinking about the music you can put to your own lyrics. This can involve coming up with a melody, or using chords and a rhythm to support your lyrics.\n\n6. At this stage, you should begin to think about testing the music that you picked.\n\nOnce you've got a rough idea of the music and melody you want to use, start testing it out. This can involve playing an instrument or recording a rough demo of the song.\n\n7. So now you have your lyrics, and you should now have music, or at least an idea of the music that you want the lyrics to be backed to.\n\nAt this point, you should have a solid idea of what your song is going to sound like. Keep refining the music and melody until it matches the mood and tone of your lyrics.\n\n8. You should have a majority of the song compiled by now, and you must bring it all together.\n\nNow that you have the pieces of the puzzle, it's time to bring it all together. This can involve tweaking the lyrics, refining the melody, adjusting the tempo, or rearranging the structure of the song.\n\n9. After stamping out the final minor critiques from other people, you have now successfully converted your song lyrics into a full song.\n\nOnce you've made any final adjustments, you're ready to share your song with the world. Congratulations, you've successfully converted your song lyrics into a full-fledged song!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":4}

{"text":"Teaching your dog new tricks is a great way to bond with your furry friend and keep him mentally stimulated. One popular trick that can be impressive and fun to teach your pup is how to play dead on command.

Start by getting your dog into a seated position. Hold a treat above his head and slowly move it down toward the ground. This should encourage him to follow the treat and lie down on his front paws. Once he's in the down position, reward him with the treat and praise.\n\n2. Choose a comfortable area to train your dog.\n\nMake sure your dog is in a comfortable and familiar environment when you're teaching him the trick. This will help him feel more relaxed and less distracted.\n\n3. Command your dog to sit.\n\nStart by commanding your dog to sit in front of you.\n\n4. Stand directly in front of your dog while he is seated.\n\nStanding directly in front of your dog will help him focus on you and the training session.\n\n5. Guide your dog to lie down without a treat.\n\nGuide your dog into the down position without using a treat or lure. Encourage him to lie down by gently pushing his front legs forward and his hind legs backward until he is lying flat on his stomach.\n\n6. Continue practicing until your dog learns how to lie down at your command.\n\nPractice the \"down\" command until your dog consistently understands what you want him to do. Use treats and praise to reinforce good behavior.\n\n7. Teach your dog to stay before teaching him how to play dead.\n\nOnce your dog understands the \"down\" command, it's time to teach him to stay in that position.\n\n8. Choose a comfortable area to train your dog.\n\nAgain, make sure your dog is in a comfortable and familiar environment.\n\n9. Command your dog to be in the position in which you would like him to stay.\n\nIn this case, you want your dog to stay in the down position.\n\n10. Stand directly in front of him for 1-2 seconds.\n\nStart by standing directly in front of your dog for a short period of time.\n\n11. Increase the amount of time that you stand in front of him.\n\nGradually increase the amount of time you stand in front of him until he can hold the \"down\" position for several minutes.\n\n12. Add a verbal cue and a visual cue.\n\nOnce your dog understands the \"stay\" command, you can add a verbal cue like \"stay\" or \"freeze\" and a visual cue like holding up your hand.\n\n13. Increase the distance from your dog.\n\nOnce your dog understands the \"stay\" command, start increasing the distance between you and your dog.\n\n14.

However, succeeding in a math contest requires more than just mathematical proficiency. Here are some tips to help you do well on math contests like the AMC:\n\n1. Decide what your goal is.\n\nBefore you start preparing for exams, think about what you want to achieve. Are you looking to win a prize, or just want to improve your score from last year? Having a clear goal in mind can help you stay motivated and focused.\n\n2. Get some old tests.\n\nPractice makes perfect. Gather past tests and practice problems to identify problem areas and improve your skills.\n\n3. Enter some contests.\n\nReal-world experience is invaluable. Register for some math contests to get a feel for the format and types of questions.\n\n4. Budget time to work on math problems, especially in the areas that you are struggling.\n\nTo do well on any exam, you need to devote time to studying. Using the identified problem areas as a guideline, spend extra time working on difficult concepts.\n\n5. Test yourself.\n\nSet up a mock exam with a timer to simulate the real test environment and identify areas where you are struggling.\n\n6. Don't try to solve a lot of problems right before the big test.\n\nCramming right before the test can lead to burnout and stress. Instead, focus on relaxing and getting a good night's sleep.\n\n7. Try to get as much sleep as possible.\n\nA well-rested brain is more adept at problem-solving than a sleep-deprived one. Eight hours of sleep per night leading up to the test is ideal.\n\n8. Make sure you bring everything you need on test day and have it ready well beforehand.\n\nCheck and double-check everything you need to bring on test day, including pens, pencils, calculators, and snacks. Then, pack your bag the night before.\n\n9. When you get into the test, pump yourself up.\n\nConfidence is key. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself of all the hard work you've put in.\n\n10. Once you get the test, stay calm.\n\nDon't let the challenges on the test frustrate or discourage you. Take deep breaths, remember your strategies, and take it one problem at a time.\n\n11. Bring a watch and time the test yourself.\n\nKeeping track of time during the test is vital to making sure you answer all of the problems.\n\n12. Make sure you have enough scrap paper.\n\nWork out your problems for each question on scrap paper before putting the answer on the exam sheet.\n\n13. OK, the test is in front of you and the stage is set.\n\nVisualize success before starting the exam. Imagine yourself breezing through the problems and nailing each question.\n\n14. Open the test book, and get started.\n\nStart with the easy problems to build momentum. This will also help identify the level of difficulty of the remaining problems.\n\n15. If you come across a question you can't do, give it one more thought.\n\nGive the problem another chance before moving on. You may be able to come up with a solution after coming back to it.\n\n16. There will always (well, almost always) be problems you can't solve.\n\nDon't get bogged down on a difficult problem. Move on to the next and come back later if there's time.\n\n17. Write clearly.\n\nTake extra care to make your numbers and variables neat and readable. This will help you and the grader identify what you were trying to do.\n\n18. If you feel yourself slowing down, or getting tired, or even giving up, ask yourself this - How many more chances will I get?\n\nThis is an opportunity to test your abilities. Use that as motivation to push harder.\n\n19. Don't be afraid of success.\n\nApproach the test with a positive mindset and visualize success. The power of positivity cannot be underestimated.\n\n20. When it's all over, and you've checked over one last time, it's time to let go.\n\nOnce the test is complete, there's no more you can do. Relax and start planning for the next one.\n\n21. Evaluate your performance.\n\nReview your performance after the exam and think about areas where you can improve. Keep track of your progress to help you reach your goals.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":11}

{"text":"Making Phyllo Dough is a skill that will impress even the most seasoned chef. Phyllo dough is a delicate, paper-thin pastry dough widely used in Mediterranean and Balkan cuisine. Its thinness makes it difficult to work with, but the end result is a crispy and delicious pastry that can be used for savory or sweet dishes. In this wikiHow, we\u2019ll take you through the process of making phyllo dough step-by-step. \n\nIngredients:\n\n- 3 cups of all-purpose flour\n- 1 teaspoon of salt\n- 1 cup of warm water\n- 1 tablespoon of white vinegar\n- 1 tablespoon of olive or vegetable oil\n\nSteps:\n\n1. In a mixer, combine flour and salt, and combine thoroughly on a low setting. This will create a uniform mixture of flour and salt.\n\n2. In a separate container, combine water, oil, and vinegar, and mix well. This mixture will help to make the dough pliable and easier to work with.\n\n3. Slowly add the water mixture into the flour mixture while continuing to mix with the paddle attachment. Once the dough becomes soft, switch out the paddle attachment with a hook attachment, and continue mixing for about 10 minutes. This will help to develop the gluten in the dough and make it stretchy.\n\n4. Remove the dough from the mixer and continue to knead by hand for two more minutes. This will ensure that the dough is well developed and ready to be rolled out.\n\n5. Use about 1 teaspoon of oil to coat the entire dough, covering it and allowing it to rest for 30 minutes. This will relax the gluten and make the dough easier to work with.\n\n6. After the dough has rested, cut the phyllo dough into roughly equal portions. Depending on your needs, you can choose to make large or small portions.\n\n7. Start rolling circular pieces of dough on a rolling pin or dowel. Be sure to dust your surface and the dough with flour to prevent sticking.\n\n8. Continue rolling the dough on the pin or dowel by wrapping the dough around the dowel and rolling back and forth. You should roll the dough until it is as thin as possible.\n\n9. Unwrap the dough by rolling the dowel back toward you. Be gentle as you transfer the dough to your working surface to avoid tearing.\n\n10. Roll the dough until it becomes translucent, rotating after each roll. This is the desired thickness and texture for phyllo dough.\n\n11. Take the translucent dough into your hands and stretch it apart very carefully to get an even thinner dough. This will require patience and care as the dough can easily tear.\n\n12. Place each finished sheet of phyllo on top of each other on a well-floured baking sheet. Repeat the process until you have 7-10 layers fully stacked.\n\n13. Enjoy your homemade phyllo dough in your favorite recipe, whether you're using it for sweet or savory dishes.\n\nIn summary, making phyllo dough may be a time-consuming process, but the end result is worth it. By following these easy steps, you can create a beautiful, flaky dough that is perfect for all kinds of recipes. Whether you're making traditional Greek spanakopita or sweet baklava, your homemade phyllo dough is sure to impress your guests.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":14}

Combine 1 1\/4 cups of flour and 1\/4 tsp of salt in a medium bowl. Cut in 1\/2 cup of shortening until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n3. Gradually add 3-4 tablespoons of ice-cold water to the mixture, stirring until the dough comes together.\n4. Roll the pastry into a ball and flatten it into a thick disk. Wrap the disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 to 45 minutes.\n5. Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly-floured surface into a 13-inch (33.02 centimeters) disk.\n6. Gently transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) pie pan.\n7. Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes or until it turns a light, golden brown. Then, reduce the oven's heat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n\nPart 2: Making the Lemon Filling\n1. In a medium-sized saucepan, whisk together 1 cup of sugar, 1\/4 cup of flour, 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, and 1\/4 teaspoon of salt until well-combined.\n2. Gradually add 1 1\/2 cups of water to the mixture, whisking to prevent lumps.\n3. Cook the mixture over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil, stirring constantly.\n4. Beat 4 egg yolks together in a bowl, then add 1\/2 cup (120 milliliters) of the hot mixture to the yolks, whisking quickly to prevent them from cooking.\n5. Add the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan, return it to a boil, and cook until it thickens, stirring constantly.\n6. Remove the saucepan from heat and whisk in 3 tablespoons of butter, 1\/2 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of finely grated lemon zest.\n7.

Beat 4 egg whites and 1\/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until they turn foamy.\n2. Gradually add 6 tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon at a time, while continuing to beat on medium-high speed.\n3. Continue beating until the mixture stands in stiff peaks, about 1 to 2 minutes. If you are using a food processor, you may not see any stiff peaks.\n4. Spoon the meringue directly onto the hot lemon filling, starting at the edges and working your way inward. Be sure to spread the meringue all the way to the rim of the crust to prevent shrinking.\n5. Bake the pie for about 10 minutes or until the topping is golden. Watch closely to prevent it from over-browning.\n6. Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for 2 hours before serving. Store any leftover pie in the fridge.\n\nCongratulations, you've successfully made a homemade lemon meringue pie!

While it is a normal part of aging, the symptoms of menopause can be highly uncomfortable and can become a significant source of distress for some women. However, there are many ways to treat menopause symptoms and make this stage of life more manageable. Here are some steps you can take to treat menopause symptoms effectively:\n\nPart 1: Understanding Menopause\n\n1. Know the stages of menopause.\n\nMenopause typically occurs in three stages: perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause. Perimenopause is the transitional period leading up to menopause and can last for several years. Menopause is the point at which a woman hasn't had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months. Postmenopause refers to the period following menopause.\n\n2. Recognize the symptoms of menopause.\n\nThe symptoms of menopause can vary from woman to woman and include hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, mood changes, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido.\n\n3. Make sense of your symptoms.\n\nIt's helpful to keep track of your symptoms and understand how they affect your daily life. This can help you determine which types of treatment may be most effective for you.\n\n4. Know what can happen next.\n\nAfter menopause, women are at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, heart disease, and other health conditions. It's important to take steps to manage these risks.\n\nPart 2: Treating Menopause Symptoms\n\n1.

Improving your sleep hygiene can help alleviate this symptom.\n\n17. Treat the mood changes.\n\nAntidepressants and hormonal treatments can help manage mood changes associated with menopause.\n\n18. Consider your sexual health.\n\nMenopause can affect sexual function and desire. Talking to your doctor about your concerns can help you determine the best course of action.\n\n19. Pay attention to problems with memory and concentration.\n\nMenopause can sometimes cause memory and concentration problems. Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about changes to your cognitive function.\n\n20. Talk to your doctor about other symptoms.\n\nIn addition to the symptoms listed above, menopause can cause a range of other symptoms, including headaches, joint pain, and tingling in the hands and feet.\n\n21. Take steps to combat osteoporosis.\n\nCalcium supplements, vitamin D, and regular weight-bearing exercise can all help prevent osteoporosis after menopause.\n\n22.

{"text":"Building a Calorimeter: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nA calorimeter is a device used to measure the calories of food. While there are commercially available calorimeters, you can also build your own using simple materials. In this article, we will guide you through the steps on how to build a calorimeter and how to calculate the calories of food.\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\n- Small metal can\n- Larger metal can\n- Mercury thermometer\n- Graduated cylinder or flask\n- Thin glass rods\n- Paperclip\n- Cork\n- Food to test\n- Accurate scale\n- Ice pick or hole punch\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Get a small metal can. This can will be used to contain water that will be heated as part of the calorimetric measurements. \n\n2. Get a larger metal can. The small can will be placed inside the larger can for insulation purposes.\n\n3. Puncture four small holes in the small can. Using a hole punch, ice pick, or other implement, carefully puncture four small holes (each one directly across from another) in the small metal can.\n\n4. Slide two thin rods between the four holes in the can. Slide one rod through the can to the other side, then repeat with the other rod and the two remaining holes; the two rods should cross each other. This will serve as a support for the small can inside the large can.\n\n5. Fill the small can with water. Using a graduated cylinder, flask, or other container, pour 100 mL of distilled water in the small metal can.\n\n6. Measure the temperature of the water. Using a mercury thermometer (not a digital one), take the initial temperature of your water.\n\n7. Place the small can inside of the larger one. The small metal can should rest securely inside the larger one, supported by the glass rods.\n\n8. Unfold a paperclip and insert one end into a cork. A standard-size paperclip will be used to hold the food inside the calorimeter.\n\n9. Obtain some food to test. Weigh the food using an accurate scale, and record the measurement.\n\n10. Prepare the cork food holder. Carefully wrap the end of the paperclip that is not sticking in the cork around the food you will test (or pierce it with the paperclip).\n\n11. Light the food. Set the cork on a flat, nonflammable surface so that the food on the paperclip is sticking up.\n\n12. Let the food burn. Keep the cans over the food for as long as it takes to burn completely.\n\n13. Check the temperature of the water. Once the food has completely burned out, stir the water in the small can using the thermometer.\n\n14. Weigh the burnt food. Once the burnt food has cooled completely, remove it from the paperclip.\n\n15. Understand the formula you will need to calculate calories. The formula used to determine the caloric value of a sample of food using a homemade calorimeter is relatively simple: calories = volume of water (in mL) x the temperature change (in Celsius) of the water.\n\n16. Gather the data you need to calculate. Subtract the initial temperature of the water from the final temperature of the water to find the temperature change. \n\n17. Calculate the calories contained in the food. Multiply the temperature change of the water by the volume of water used. Then divide this number by the weight of the burnt food to get the number of calories per gram of food. \n\nConclusion:\n\nBy following these simple steps, you can build your own calorimeter to measure the calories of food. Remember to take note of all measurements and readings in order to properly calculate and determine the caloric value of your sample food.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":25}

Be sure to think about the purpose of the coat so you can choose one that can be worn with multiple outfits.\n\n15. Layer clothes beneath a large coat for warmth.\n\nHaving layers beneath your coat will provide an extra layer of warmth when needed. Think of layering a turtleneck with a sweater, finishing your look off with your coat.\n\n16. Purchase a hooded coat to eliminate the need for an umbrella.\n\nHooded coats help to keep you dry, eliminating the need for an umbrella and keeping the look polished.\n\n17. Think twice before parting with a garment \u2013 recycle fabrics for scarfs, mittens, hats, slippers, purses, and other accessories.\n\nBefore parting with any garments, think if there\u2019s another way to incorporate them into your wardrobe.\n\n18. Wear a scarf in your hair, around your neck, or as a belt.\n\nA scarf can be worn in many versatile ways beyond being wrapped around the neck.\n\n19. Purchase a garment thinking of how it can be altered in the future into another outfit.\n\nPurchasing garments with the idea of how they can be altered later is a smart investment. This allows the opportunity to wear the same piece as a new outfit. \n\nBy following these guidelines, creating a versatile wardrobe (women) is possible without breaking the bank or taking up too much space. The key is selecting pieces that can be mixed and matched in various ways, helping to create a never-ending wardrobe.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":26}

{"text":"How to Deal with a Narcissist\n\nDealing with a narcissist can be a challenging task, whether it is in your personal or professional life. Narcissists have a way of making people around them feel unimportant and often leave them feeling insignificant. This article will help you learn how to identify a narcissist, understand their limitations, and communicate effectively with them.\n\nPart 1: Identifying a Narcissist\n\n1. Observe their behavior- Narcissists often think highly of themselves and their abilities. They may act in ways that are condescending or belittling to others, and they will often insist on having their own way.\n\n2. Listen to their conversations- Narcissists tend to dominate conversations and often steer them in the direction that serves their interests. You may notice that they often speak about themselves and do not give other people much of a chance to contribute to the conversation.\n\n3. Recognize their need for validation- Narcissists crave attention and admiration. They may go to great lengths to receive praise and recognition from others, often exaggerating their accomplishments and abilities.\n\nPart 2: Dealing with a Narcissist\n\n1. Figure out your own needs- If you are in need of someone who can provide mutual support and understanding, it is best to limit the time you spend with the narcissist in favor of others who can provide you with more of what you need.\n\n2. Accept their limitations- Narcissists have a hard time acknowledging their own faults and weaknesses. Recognizing this can help you manage your expectations and avoid unnecessary frustration.\n\n3. Define your own self-worth by other means- Ideally, self-worth is built from the inside rather than being dependent on outside support, but for many, self-worth grows stronger when others affirm their existence by valuing them as individuals.\n\n4. Try to have compassion- Narcissists may have a hard time connecting with others emotionally. Trying to understand their perspective and having compassion for their struggles may help improve your relationship.\n\n5. Avoid the mind games- Narcissists are likely to engage in mind games and manipulation tactics to maintain control. Avoid playing into their games by setting healthy boundaries and keeping communication straightforward.\n\n6. Do not expect to please a narcissist- Narcissists have high expectations of others, making it difficult for them to be satisfied. Do not put too much energy into trying to please them, as it is unlikely to succeed.\n\n7. Listen a lot- Narcissists may feel unheard, which can impact their behavior. Listening actively and making them feel heard and understood may improve communication and lessen tension.\n\n8. Be as genuine in your praise as possible- Narcissists can often detect insincere flattery. Try to provide praise when appropriate, but be honest and authentic.\n\n9. Smile and nod- If you find yourself in a conversation with a narcissist that requires little input from you, try to stay engaged by smiling and nodding.\n\n10. Persuade the narcissist that what you want benefits them- Narcissists may be more willing to agree to things that directly benefit them. Find ways to frame your requests in a way that emphasizes their benefits.\n\n11. Present constructive criticism in docile terms- The narcissist will never accept blatant criticism. Instead, find ways to present your concerns in a way that is gentle and non-threatening.\n\n12. Consider an intervention- If you are concerned about a narcissist's behavior, you may want to consider an intervention. This can be done with the help of a professional and a group of close friends or family members.\n\n13. Get the help of a professional- Narcissists can be challenging to work with, and a professional may be able to provide guidance on how to manage the relationship.\n\n14. Recruit about 4 or 5 people- An intervention is most effective when several people work together to address the issue. Try to gather a group of people that the narcissist respects and trusts.\n\n15. Plan the intervention- A successful intervention requires careful planning. Consider the timing, location, and wording of the intervention before approaching the narcissist.\n\n16. Make it clear how the narcissist is hurting themselves- Narcissists often focus on their own needs and desires, making it difficult for them to see how their behavior is hurting themselves and others. Be clear about how their behavior is negatively impacting their life and relationships.\n\nDealing with a narcissist can be challenging, but with patience, compassion, and effective communication, it is possible to establish a healthy relationship. Remember to prioritize your own needs and maintain healthy boundaries, while also recognizing the limitations and needs of the narcissist.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":31}

{"text":"Drywall is a popular material for home construction and renovation because it is easy to work with and relatively inexpensive. However, accidents can happen, and it's not uncommon to end up with a hole in your drywall. Repairing smaller holes in drywall is a relatively simple task, but it can become more challenging when dealing with larger holes. Here's how to repair larger holes in drywall:\n\nPart 1: Prepare the Materials\n\n1. Find a piece of drywall that is at least 2\" bigger on all 4 sides that is the same thickness of the existing drywall (max size 12\").\n\n2. Cut out the damaged area of the existing drywall to a perfect square, even on all sides.\n\n3. Measure the size of the hole.\n\n4. Once the measurements have been applied, cut from edge to edge of the drywall so that you have a square in the middle and a 2\" perimeter around the square (the back should look like a number sign \"#\").\n\n5. Gently break the outer 2\" area of the gypsum (the white powder substance in between the 2 pieces of paper that make up drywall) and the brown paper off.\n\nPart 2: Apply the Drywall Compound\n\n1. Take some pre-mixed lite drywall compound and put it in a small pail. Mix about 1\/8 of water into the compound and stir till the consistency is like pancake batter.\n\n2. Apply the mud onto the brown side of your patch, 2\" strip that is around your square patch, and around the hole on the wall.\n\n3. Take your patch and place it in the hole so that the piece of drywall is level with your existing wall, with lots of mud in between the patch and the wall.\n\n4. Take your 5\" drywall mud knife and remove all excess mud.\n\n5. Put a coat of mud (about 1\/8\" thick) on the entire perimeter of the drywall patch, making sure that all of the paper portion of the 2\" strip is coated.\n\n6. Lightly sand and apply a final coat.\n\nPart 3: Final Touches\n\n1. Final sand happens 2 days from start to finish.\n\n2. After painting is complete, it will look like the hole was never there.\n\nRepairing larger holes in drywall can seem like a daunting task, but with a little patience and some basic tools, it can be done relatively quickly and easily. Following these steps will help ensure that your repair looks seamless and professional, and that you're left with a wall that looks like new.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":37}

{"text":"How to Avoid Drama in School: A Complete Guide\n\nGoing to school is supposed to be a fun and exciting experience, but unfortunately, drama always finds its way into the mix. Whether it's a rumor going around about you or a friend causing unnecessary drama, it can be difficult to avoid. However, with some simple tips and tricks, you can learn how to avoid drama in school. From not telling anyone about your crush to avoiding sleazy clothing, we've got you covered. Here is a complete guide on how to avoid drama in school.\n\n1. Do not tell anyone whether or not you \"like\" someone.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to start drama in school is by telling your friends about your crush. While it may seem harmless, it can quickly spiral out of control. You may tell one trusted friend as a best friend, but don't make it a huge rumor as it will spread to your crush in an instant. This can cause huge drama within your school, easily breaking friendships and making it hard to focus on what's really important.\n\n2. Avoid wearing too much makeup or sleazy clothing.\n\nIt's understandable to want to look your best, but you should take care not to attract the wrong kind of attention. Avoid wearing too much makeup or wearing sleazy clothing like heels, super tight jeans, low-cut tops, short skirts, spaghetti straps or tees with rude or sleazy sayings on them, etc. You will notice that at new schools, other girls will give you \"the look\". Keep it simple and modest.\n\n3. Be nice to everyone.\n\nIt may seem like an obvious tip, but it's important to remember to be kind to everyone, even those you don't necessarily get along with. Being kind can often diffuse drama before it even starts. Remember, everyone is fighting their own battles, and kindness can go a long way.\n\n4. Do not lie to anyone about anything.\n\nLying always catches up to you. If you get called out on more than 2 or 3 lies, people will start to see you as a liar and no one will trust you. This can make it harder to make friends and can cause unnecessary drama.\n\n5. Do not talk about anyone behind their back.\n\nTalking behind someone's back is never a good idea. It can spread untrue rumors and create drama where none existed before. It's always best to confront someone face-to-face if you have an issue with them.\n\n6. Always go to the person who is saying something about you or someone you care about before you get mad and start things that don't need to be started.\n\nIf someone is spreading rumors or talking badly about you or someone else you care about, it's always best to go to that person directly. This can often diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand.\n\n7. If anyone starts to argue, and you're not the type of person to choose sides, just stand and listen!\n\nSometimes, the best thing you can do in a heated argument is to remain neutral. You don't have to choose sides, but you can be a good listener.\n\n8. Don't get involved in other people's dramas.\n\nIt can be tempting to get involved in your friend's drama, but it's important to remember that it's not your battle to fight. Try to stay out of other people's dramas and encourage your friends to do the same.\n\n9. If your friends fight, be diplomatic.\n\nIf your friends are fighting, try your best to be diplomatic. Encourage them to talk things out and find a solution that works for both parties.\n\n10. If you fall out with a friend, don't run around telling everyone.\n\nIf you have a falling out with a friend, it can be tempting to tell everyone what happened. However, this can only make the situation worse. Try to keep things private and deal with the situation maturely.\n\n11. Popularity isn't everything.\n\nIt can be easy to get caught up in popularity, but it's important to remember that it's not everything. Focus on being kind and authentic, and the rest will fall into place.\n\n12. If someone has offended you, ignore it.\n\nSometimes, the best way to avoid drama is to ignore it. If someone has offended you, try your best to brush it off and move on. Dwelling on it will only make things worse.\n\n13. You may find that you have a friend who cannot help getting into arguments.\n\nIf you have a friend who always seems to be getting into arguments, try your best to avoid getting involved. Encourage them to resolve things calmly and maturely, and if it becomes too much, it may be time to distance yourself.\n\nIn conclusion, drama can often feel inevitable in school, but with some simple tips and tricks, you can learn how to avoid it.

With these strategies, you'll be well on your way to a drama-free school year.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":40}

{"text":"How to Record the Paranormal\n\nDo you believe in ghosts or other paranormal entities? Do you want to capture evidence of their presence? Recording the paranormal can be a fascinating and rewarding experience, but it takes careful preparation, patience, and a willingness to explore the unknown. Whether you're a seasoned ghost hunter or a curious amateur, following these steps can help you document your paranormal encounters.\n\n1. Know your facts.\n\nBefore you start your investigation, make sure you have a good understanding of what you're dealing with. Read up on the paranormal phenomena you're interested in, such as ghosts, poltergeists, spirits, imprints, hauntings, and negative entities. Learn about the different theories, explanations, and debates surrounding these phenomena. Familiarize yourself with the terminology, tools, and techniques commonly used in paranormal research. The more you know, the better equipped you'll be to document your experiences and interpret your findings.\n\n2. Always try to recreate your experiences.\n\nOne of the most important rules in paranormal investigation is to rule out natural explanations before jumping to supernatural conclusions. Whenever you experience something unusual, try to replicate the conditions that led to it. For example, if you hear a strange noise, try to determine where it came from, what caused it, and whether it can be duplicated. If you see a ghostly figure, check for reflections, shadows, or other optical illusions that might have produced the image. If you feel a sudden chill, look for drafts, humidity, or other atmospheric factors that might have caused it.\n\n3. Try to get information about your situation.\n\nIf you're investigating a haunted location, try to gather as much information as possible about its history, inhabitants, and previous encounters with paranormal activity. Talk to the owners, caretakers, or neighbors of the location, and ask them about any strange occurrences they've witnessed or heard about. Look up records, news articles, or folklore related to the location, and see if there are any patterns or stories that might explain the activity. The more context you have, the easier it will be to recognize and document the phenomena you encounter.\n\n4. Know the different tools you have to work with.\n\nThere are many tools and techniques that can aid you in paranormal investigation, such as cameras, EMF meters, audio recorders, EVP devices, infrared thermometers, and more. Research which tools are most appropriate for your particular investigation, and learn how to use them properly. Make sure you have enough batteries, memory cards, and other supplies to last throughout your investigation. Test your equipment before you start your investigation, and make sure you know how to operate it in different conditions.\n\n5. Remember that if you have a ghost in your home that they were people once and technically still are.\n\nIf you're dealing with a ghost or spirit that seems to be attached to you or your home, remember that it's likely a former human being with emotions, memories, and intentions. Try to approach the entity with respect, empathy, and compassion. Don't try to provoke or antagonize it, as this can worsen the situation. If you communicate with the entity, speak calmly and clearly, and ask open-ended questions. If you sense that the entity is harmful or malevolent, seek professional help.\n\n6. Know that there are not just ghosts, you can have a poltergeist, ghost, spirit, imprint, haunting, negative entity, and a number of other things.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, there are many different types of paranormal phenomena, each with their own characteristics, causes, and effects. Not all paranormal activity is caused by ghosts or spirits; some may be the result of residual energy from past events or emotions, or the presence of negative entities or psychic attacks. Be open-minded and adaptable to different types of phenomena, and don't assume that every strange occurrence is evidence of supernatural activity.\n\n7. After you have pinpointed which one you have and followed the other steps just think back to the things that happened inexplicably.\n\nOnce you've gathered enough evidence and information to identify the possible cause of your paranormal experiences, review your findings and look for patterns, consistencies, and anomalies. Analyze your data objectively and critically, and try to rule out any natural explanations before drawing any conclusions. Ask for feedback or input from other investigators or experts, and be willing to revise your theories if new evidence emerges.\n\n8. Don't bother going to a physic.\n\nAlthough some people may believe in the abilities of psychics or mediums to contact or interpret the paranormal, these methods are often dismissed or debunked by scientific researchers. Instead of relying on supernatural or pseudoscientific approaches, use scientific methods and tools to gather and analyze evidence of paranormal activity. If you feel that you need professional help or guidance, seek out qualified paranormal investigators or researchers who can offer objective and unbiased advice.\n\n9. Start your investigation at the time when you have noticed activity to be at a high, the middle of the night isn't always the best time.\n\nParanormal activity can occur at any time, but some phenomena are more likely to occur during certain periods or conditions. If you've noticed patterns or trends in the activity you're investigating, try to schedule your investigation during those times or conditions. For example, if you've noticed more activity in a particular room or area of your home, focus your investigation on that location. If you've observed that activity is more frequent or intense at night, plan your investigation accordingly.\n\n10. Remember that the entities are there for a reason, some are there because they are family and are helping you, others because they used to own the house, maybe they are tied to the land and mad that now there's a building on it, maybe you drew the spirit in.\n\nUnderstanding the motivations and intentions of paranormal entities can be challenging, as they may not communicate their thoughts or feelings clearly or directly. However, it's important to keep in mind that paranormal activity often has a context or backstory that can shed light on why it's occurring. Try to investigate not just the phenomena themselves, but also the history, culture, and context that surrounds them. Be respectful, patient, and curious, and approach your investigation with an open mind and heart. Who knows what you may discover?","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":54}
{"text":"Taking off and landing on a short runway can be a challenge for even the most experienced pilots. But with the right techniques and strategies, it's possible to do so safely and efficiently. In this article, we'll go through step-by-step instructions on how to takeoff and land on a short runway.\n\nPart 1: Takeoff\n\n1. Obtain takeoff clearance from the tower or announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). This is an important step to make sure that there aren't any other aircraft in the area.\n\n2. Taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the center-line. Make sure that you're as straight as possible, as even a small angle can make a big difference on a short runway.\n\n3. If acceleration from the hold short line is not possible, taxi to the takeoff end. Depending on the length of the runway, you might need to taxi to the very end in order to give yourself enough room to get up to speed.\n\n4. Smoothly apply full power and release the brakes once the RPM is in the green arc. This will get the plane moving forward and up to speed.\n\n5. Keep the plane centered with the rudder pedals. As you begin to pick up speed, you'll need to use the rudder pedals to keep the plane straight. This is especially important on a short runway, where you don't have a lot of room for error.\n\n6. By the point of time you reach about 20% below rotation speed, set the flaps to the takeoff position. This will help you get off the ground more quickly.\n\n7. Once rotation speed is reached gently pull back on the yoke. This will help lift the nose up and get you off the ground. Be careful not to overdo it, though, as you don't want to stall the plane.\n\n8. If the density altitude and gross weight are both climb at the best angle of climb speed, Vx, which can also be found in the POH. This will give you the best rate of climb and help you get up to altitude more quickly.\n\nPart 2: Landing\n\n1. Enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the CTAF. Make sure that you're following standard protocol and communicating with any other aircraft in the area.\n\n2. Fly the standard traffic pattern, beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway. This will give you enough time to get lined up and make any adjustments before coming in for landing.\n\n3. Turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely (30\u00b0 or 40\u00b0 depending on the aircraft).

{"text":"How to Tell if Vaginal Discharge Is Normal\n\nVaginal discharge is a normal and healthy occurrence for women. It plays a vital role in maintaining the health of your reproductive system by keeping the vagina clean and lubricated. However, the appearance, smell, and amount of discharge can change depending on various factors, such as hormonal fluctuations, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and infections. In this article, we will discuss how to tell if vaginal discharge is normal and when to seek medical attention.\n\nPart 1: Observing Normal Changes\n\n1. Expect changes in appearance over the month\nIt is normal for your discharge to vary in texture and color throughout your menstrual cycle. Just before and after your period, the discharge may be thick and white or clear and stretchy like egg whites. During ovulation, it may appear watery and abundant. Mid-cycle, the discharge is usually clear and thin.\n\n2. Inspect the clarity midway through your cycle\nTo determine if your discharge is normal, look at a sample midway through your menstrual cycle. Normal discharge should be clear or milky white and free of odor.\n\n3. Look for creamy, white discharge\nCreamy white discharge is common and normal. It typically appears in the second half of your menstrual cycle before your period.\n\n4. Expect clear, watery discharge\nDuring ovulation, which usually occurs around day 14 of your cycle, your discharge may be clear and watery.\n\n5. Don't be alarmed by brown discharge near the end of your period\nBrown discharge is common at the end of your period when your body is expelling old blood. It should not have a foul smell.\n\n6. Relax if it's odorless or nearly odorless\nNormal discharge should have a mild scent or be odorless. If your discharge has a strong, foul, fishy, or yeasty odor, it may be a sign of infection.\n\n7. Measure the amount of discharge\nNormal discharge can range from scant to abundant, but it should not interfere with your daily activities or cause itching or burning.\n\nPart 2: Recognizing Abnormal Discharge\n\n1. Look for cloudy, yellow discharge\nCloudy or yellow discharge may be a sign of infection, such as trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, or gonorrhea.\n\n2. Check for bloody or brown discharge\nBloody or brown discharge outside of your menstrual period may indicate bleeding or infection. You should see a doctor if this occurs.\n\n3. Identify frothy yellow- or green-tinged discharge\nFrothy yellow or green-tinged discharge may indicate trichomoniasis or another infection.\n\n4. Look for a thick, white discharge that resembles cottage cheese\nA thick, white discharge that resembles cottage cheese may be a sign of a yeast infection.\n\n5. Examine your underwear for gray-colored discharge\nGray-colored discharge with a foul odor may be a sign of bacterial vaginosis.\n\n6. Look for additional symptoms\nAbnormal discharge may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as itching, burning, pain during sex, or lower abdominal discomfort.\n\nPart 3: Maintaining Vaginal Health\n\n1. Make an appointment with your doctor\nIf you notice sudden changes in your discharge, or if you have abnormal discharge with other symptoms, schedule an appointment with your doctor.\n\n2. Take all medicine as prescribed\nIf your doctor diagnoses you with an infection, take all prescribed medication as directed.\n\n3. Keep your vagina clean\nWash your genital area with mild soap and warm water. Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or feminine deodorants, which can upset the balance of your natural bacteria.\n\n4. Never douche\nDouching can increase your risk of infection and disrupt the natural pH balance of your vagina.\n\n5. Wipe from front to back\nAfter using the bathroom, always wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anus from spreading to the vagina.\n\n6. Wear 100-percent cotton underwear\nCotton underwear allows your skin to breathe and absorbs moisture, reducing the risk of infection.\n\n7. Avoid \"skinny jeans\"\nTight jeans and trousers can increase heat and moisture in the genital area, leading to irritation and infection.\n\n8. Change out of a wet bathing suit ASAP\nMoist environments provide ideal conditions for bacterial growth, so it's essential to change out of a wet bathing suit as soon as possible.\n\n9.

{"text":"Selling your car can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By selling it yourself rather than trading it in, you can often get more money for your vehicle. Follow these steps to ensure you get the most for your car.\n\n1. Get a copy of your vehicle's value\nBefore you can determine how much to sell your car for, you need to know its true value. Go to websites like kellybluebook.com and edmunds.com to get private party values for your vehicle. This will give you a good idea of what similar cars are selling for in your area.\n\n2. Evaluate your car's condition\nBe honest with yourself about your car's condition. Think about what you would look for as a buyer. Does it have scratches, dents, or other damage? Is it missing anything? Consider the mileage, too. Add up the value from step 1, and divide it by two to get an average value for your market.\n\n3. Keep service and maintenance records\nKeeping detailed service and maintenance records can add value to your asking price. If you don't have the records for any major repairs, go back to the place where you had the work done and ask them to print you a copy of all the work they have done on your vehicle.\n\n4. Detail your car\nBefore you show your car to potential buyers, give it a thorough cleaning. Replace any burnt out lights, fuses, etc. Get an oil change, and top off any fluids that are low.\n\n5. Advertise your car\nNow that your car is ready to sell, it's time to tell the world! Post your ad on websites like autotrader.com and cars.com, which will charge you but provide a lot of exposure. Also, use social media to tell your friends that you're selling your car. Buy a few \"For Sale\" signs to put on your car, too.\n\n6. Answer potential buyer's questions\nWhen potential buyers contact you about your car, they'll likely have questions for you. Answer these questions honestly but keep your answers short. You don't need to tell them every detail about your car. Common questions include why you're selling your car, how many miles it has, and what the asking price is.\n\n7. Impress potential buyers\nWhen you show your car to potential buyers, make a good impression. Think of it like a date you're trying to impress. The way you present yourself says a lot about you and how you take care of your car.\n\n8. Set a fair price\nThe price you ask for your car should already have a padding of $300-$500. This is because the most common amount people ask off the price you're asking. Always come down on your price in increments of $200 and have a limit to what you'll accept as a final offer. If your car needs repairs, you may have to discount it according to what it would cost you to have it fixed.\n\n9. Complete the sale\nOnce you've agreed on a price with a buyer, have them pay in cash or with a cashier's check. Never accept personal checks. Sign over your title based on your state's requirements. This information can be found on dmv.org for your individual state.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be sure to get the most money for your car when selling it yourself.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":58}

{"text":"Using \"Find\" in Excel VBA Macros is a powerful tool that can help you automate tasks and save time. In this article, you will learn the basic syntax of the .Find command and how to use it in various scenarios.\n\n1. Understanding the Syntax of .Find:\nThe syntax of .Find is as follows:\nexpression.Find(What, After, LookIn, LookAt, SearchOrder, SearchDirection, MatchCase, MatchByte, SearchFormat)\n- Expression (Required): is any valid range Object.\n- What (Required): The value you want to find.\n- After (Optional): The cell after which you want to start the search.\n- LookIn (Optional): The type of information you want to look for (Values, Formulas, Comments).\n- LookAt (Optional): The type of match you want to do (Whole or Part).\n- SearchOrder (Optional): The order in which you want to search (Rows or Columns).\n- SearchDirection (Optional): The direction in which you want to search (Next or Previous).\n- MatchCase (Optional): Whether you want to match case-sensitive text.\n- MatchByte (Optional): Whether you want to match by byte value.\n- SearchFormat (Optional): Whether you want to match by format.\n\n2. Basic Usage of .Find:\nTo use .Find, you need to specify the range in which you want to search and the value you want to find. Here is an example of how to use .Find to find the first occurrence of \"hello\" in cells A1:A10:\nSub find_hello()\nDim rng As Range\nSet rng = Range(\"A1:A10\")\nSet c = rng.Find(\"hello\", LookIn:=xlValues)\nIf Not c Is Nothing Then\nMsgBox \"Found at \" & c.Address\nElse\nMsgBox \"Not Found\"\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\n3. Starting the Search After a Specific Cell:\nIf you want to start the search after a specific cell, you can pass the cell as the After parameter. Here is an example of how to use .Find to find the first occurrence of \"world\" in cells A1:A10, starting the search after cell A5:\nSub find_world()\nDim rng As Range\nSet rng = Range(\"A1:A10\")\nSet c = rng.Find(\"world\", After:=Range(\"A5\"), LookIn:=xlValues)\nIf Not c Is Nothing Then\nMsgBox \"Found at \" & c.Address\nElse\nMsgBox \"Not Found\"\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\n4. Searching for Formulas or Comments:\nIf you want to search for formulas or comments instead of values, you can specify the LookIn parameter accordingly. Here is an example of how to use .Find to find the first cell that contains a formula in cells A1:A10:\nSub find_formula()\nDim rng As Range\nSet rng = Range(\"A1:A10\")\nSet c = rng.Find(What:=\"*\", LookIn:=xlFormulas)\nIf Not c Is Nothing Then\nMsgBox \"Found formula at \" & c.Address\nElse\nMsgBox \"Not Found\"\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\n5. Searching for Part of a Word:\nIf you want to search for part of a word instead of the whole word, you can specify the LookAt parameter accordingly. Here is an example of how to use .Find to find the first cell that contains \"ell\" as part of a word in cells A1:A10:\nSub find_ell()\nDim rng As Range\nSet rng = Range(\"A1:A10\")\nSet c = rng.Find(What:=\"ell\", LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlPart)\nIf Not c Is Nothing Then\nMsgBox \"Found at \" & c.Address\nElse\nMsgBox \"Not Found\"\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\n6. Searching in Different Directions:\nIf you want to search in a different direction other than the default direction (from top to bottom, left to right), you can specify the SearchDirection parameter accordingly. Here is an example of how to use .Find to find the last cell that contains \"hello\" in cells A1:A10, searching in reverse order:\nSub find_last_hello()\nDim rng As Range\nSet rng = Range(\"A1:A10\")\nSet c = rng.Find(\"hello\", After:=rng.Cells(rng.Rows.Count, rng.Columns.Count), LookIn:=xlValues, SearchDirection:=xlPrevious)\nIf Not c Is Nothing Then\nMsgBox \"Found at \" & c.Address\nElse\nMsgBox \"Not Found\"\nEnd If\nEnd Sub\n\nIn conclusion, using the .Find command in Excel VBA macros can be a very useful tool that can help you automate tasks and save time. By understanding the basic syntax and implementing some of the examples provided in this article, you can take your Excel skills to the next level.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":65}

In this wikiHow article, we will show you how to kill in Command and Conquer 3 Skirmishes.\n\nPart 1 of 4: Get Familiar with the Controls and Production Menus\n\nThe first thing you should do is to get familiar with the controls and the production menus. This way, you can quickly pull up and select units as fast as possible. Knowing the controls is crucial if you want to have any chance of winning.\n\nPart 2 of 4: Choose Your Favorite Faction\n\nThe next step is to choose which faction is your favorite to use. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you must understand them to make informed decisions about your strategy.\n\nPart 3 of 4: Find Your Favorite Map to Play\n\nBefore you start playing, find your favorite map to play. If you are familiar with the map, it will be easier for you to navigate the terrain and find the best spots to attack your enemy.\n\nPart 4 of 4: Start the Skirmish and Start Building\n\nAs soon as the skirmish starts, select your production structure. This structure will allow you to build units and structures that will help you win. Put the rally point for your Surveyor close to another tiberium field and unpack it as soon as possible. Lay down your power plant, and immediately start building a barracks.\n\nLay down your barracks and start pumping out troops that can destroy buildings easily. Send them to where you know or think your enemy is. While you wait for them to get there, start building a crane. Lay the crane down and start building a refinery and a war factory.\n\nOnce your troops get to where they are going, attack their power plants. Back at your base, lay down your refinery and start building another one immediately. When your second refinery is done, lay it down next to the field that you sent your Surveyor to.\n\nStart building your first advanced structure, like a tech center or a super-weapon control structure. Set up your vehicles to protect your base and keep them there for now. Lay down your advanced structure and second war factory and start building a tech center and another power plant.\n\nAs soon as your tech center is done, lay it down along with your power plants and upgrade them. This whole time you should have been pumping out all kinds of vehicles like crazy. As soon as your tech center hits the ground, go to the support tab and build your super-weapon control structure.\n\nNow comes crunch time. Build a couple more power plants and upgrade them, then build no less than three more war factories and four more aircraft structures. Start making bombing runs with your air support, and just keep sending tank after tank at them. Basically, you are just waiting for your super-weapon to charge up so you can take out their main production structures.\n\nIn conclusion, to kill in Command and Conquer 3 Skirmishes, you need to be strategic and know how to quickly pull up and select units.

Look no further, as this article has everything you need to know about taking care of your hands and achieving stylish nail looks!\n\nStep 1: Care for Your Hands and Nails\n\nTo start, it's important to care for your hands and nails on a regular basis. Once a week, trim your nails if they're getting too long and clean underneath them to remove any dirt. Keep your nails short and square-shaped for a natural look.\n\nStep 2: Know Your Manicures and Pedicures\n\nManicures are when you focus on your hand nails, and pedicures are when you do your feet. If you're doing a manicure, here are a few tips to get you started:\n\n- Soak your nails in warm water for a few minutes.\n- Push back your cuticles with a cuticle pusher or stick.\n- File your nails in one direction to avoid splitting.\n- Apply a base coat, two coats of color, and a top coat for a longer-lasting finish.\n\nStep 3: Classy and Casual Nail Looks\n\nNow that you know the basics of a manicure, it's time to experiment with different nail looks. For a classy and casual style, try clear or sheer shades, which are often allowed in school. Soft sparkly brown, sheer brown, and pale pink are all great colors to try.\n\nStep 4: Stepping into Spring with Bold Colors\n\nFor a more daring look, step into spring with bright colors and stand-out shades. Try bright blue, pink, and purple, or go for a soft coral or rich red. These shades are perfect for a day out with friends or a fun night on the town.\n\nStep 5: Easy Nail Art Designs\n\nFor those looking to add some creativity to their manicure, nail art could be the way to go. While you might think it requires lots of fussy stickers and jewels, effective nail art doesn't always mean adding little bits and pieces.\n\nHere are a few easy nail art designs you can achieve with just a few polishes:\n\n- Strawberry: Paint your nails with a dark red shade and leave to dry. Then, using a thin brush or toothpick, add small green leaves at the top of each nail.\n- Stripes: Paint your nails with a clear polish, and allow it to dry (so your next shades have something to cling onto). Then, using a striper brush, add multiple thin stripes in alternating colors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can achieve the perfect spring and summer nails, with a variety of looks from stylish and casual to bold and daring.

For instance, if the number is 54289, you should separate it as 54|28|9. If the number has an odd number of digits, the leftmost digit should be paired with a zero.\n\nFind the largest integer n whose square is lesser than or equal to the leftmost number (or pair).\n\nNext, find the largest integer 'n' such that 'n\u00b2' is less than or equal to the first pair of digits (the leftmost one). In our example, since 6\u00b2 = 36 and 7\u00b2 = 49, we choose n as 6, as it is the largest number whose square is less than or equal to 54.\n\nSubtract the number you just calculated from the leftmost pair.\n\nNow, subtract the number you just calculated (6) from the leftmost pair (54), giving you 54 - 36 = 18.\n\nDrop down the next pair.\n\nBring down the next pair of digits (28) and write them next to the remainder (18).\n\nFill in the blank spaces in the right quadrant.\n\nDraw a line under the first pair of digits and fill in the blank spaces with a pair of zeros. We now have 6|18|00.\n\nSubtract the number you just calculated from the current number on the left.\n\nDivide the leftmost pair (6) by two to obtain 3, and write it above the current pair (18). Multiply it by itself and subtract the result from the current number (18 - 9 = 9).\n\nRepeat step 4.\n\nBring down the next pair of digits (00) and append it to the current remainder, giving you 900.\n\nRepeat steps 5 and 6.\n\nRepeat the process of dividing, multiplying, and subtracting until you have a quotient that is as long as you need it. Once you have reached the end of the digits, add a decimal point and a pair of zeros to show that there are no more digits to bring down.\n\nTo continue to calculate digits, drop a pair of zeros on the left, and repeat steps 4, 5 and 6.\n\nIf you need to keep calculating digits, drop a pair of zeros on the left and continue with steps 4, 5, and 6 until you have calculated the desired number of decimal places.\n\nConsider the number you are calculating the square root of as the area S of a square.\n\nConsider the number you are calculating the square root of (e.g. 54,289) as the area (S) of a square.\n\nSpecify letter variables for each digit of your answer.\n\nAssign a letter variable (e.g. A, B, C...) to each digit of your answer.\n\nSpecify letter variables for each \"chunk\" of your starting number.\n\nSimilarly, assign a letter variable to each \"chunk\" of your starting number (e.g. A, B, C....).\n\nUnderstand this method's connection to long division.\n\nThis method is related to long division, where the divisor is the number whose square root we are looking for, and the dividend is the partial remainder we obtain at each step.\n\nFind the biggest number whose square is less than or equal to Sa.\n\nFind the largest possible integer 'A' such that 'A\u00b2' is less than or equal to 'S'. This will be the first digit of the square root.\n\nVisualize the square whose area you are beginning to solve.\n\nVisualize the square whose area you are beginning to solve, and identify the leftover, rectangular area that needs to be solved.\n\nSubtract A\u00b2 from Sa.\n\nSubtract 'A\u00b2' from 'S' to determine the remainder, which we will denote as 'R'.\n\nLook for N1 = 2\u00d710A\u00d7B + B\u00b2, also written as N1 = (2\u00d710A + B) \u00d7 B.\n\nLook for a number 'N1' that, when added to 'A\u00d710', yields a number less than or equal to 'R\u00d7100'. This number 'N1' would be of the form '2\u00d710A\u00d7B + B\u00b2' or '(2\u00d710A + B) \u00d7 B'. Identify 'B' as the next digit of the answer.\n\nSolve.\n\nCompute 'N1' and subtract it from 'R'. This gives us a new remainder, 'R1', which we will use to repeat the process.\n\nRepeat steps 15-17 until all digits of the square root are found.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":70}

{"text":"How to Skate an Artificial Caddis Fly\n\nIf you're an avid fly fisherman, you've likely heard of the technique known as skating a fly. Skating involves keeping a dry fly on the surface of the water by moving it across the water with tiny twitches of the rod tip. Skating an artificial caddis fly can be particularly effective in fooling trout, as caddisflies are a common food source for many species of trout. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Tie on a caddis imitation.\n\nYou can purchase pre-made caddisfly imitations at your local sporting goods store, or you can tie your own. When selecting your fly, be sure to consider the size and color of the natural caddisflies in the water you'll be fishing. Tie on your fly of choice to the tippet of your line.\n\n2. Position yourself slightly upstream and to the right or left of where you believe the trout are holding in the river or stream.\n\nThis will allow you to cast your fly to the area where the fish are without spooking them.\n\n3. Make a cast across the creek or stream and allow the fly to float downstream on the opposite side of the stream from where you are standing.\n\nThis will create a realistic drift for your fly.\n\n4. As the fly reaches the end of its drift and your line straightens out, you will want to raise the rod tip upward toward the sky - but still pointing in the general direction of the fish, or where you think the fish may be holding.\n\nThis will cause the fly to skate across the surface of the water.\n\n5. As soon as the fly starts to move across the surface of the creek, you should gently shake the rod tip and try to put uniform \"waves\" into your fly-line.\n\nThis will create the appearance of a caddisfly struggling to take flight, which can be irresistible to a hungry trout.\n\n6. As the fly dances across the creek, you should be ready for a trout to launch itself toward the fly.\n\nBe prepared for a subtle take - the trout may simply sip the fly off of the surface of the water.\n\n7. If you do not connect with a trout, repeat the steps a few times from the same location.\n\nTrout can be finicky, so don't be discouraged if you don't catch anything on your first try.\n\n8. If a trout does connect with the fly, there is usually no need to forcefully set the hook - the trout normally hook themselves.\n\nSimply lift your rod tip and start reeling in your line to bring the fish in.\n\nSkating an artificial caddis fly can be a thrilling way to catch trout, and it requires a bit of finesse and patience. With a little practice, it can become an effective way to add some excitement to your fly fishing adventures.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":72}

{"text":"Encouraging your baby to eat vegetables can be a challenge, but it's important for their health and development. With a few simple tips and tricks, you can help your baby learn to love their greens and other colorful veggies. Here's how to get started:\n\n1. Start feeding vegetables early on. As soon as your doctor recommends feeding solid foods, start incorporating vegetables into your baby's diet. Steamed and pureed carrots, sweet potatoes, peas, and green beans are all great options.\n\n2. Give your baby vegetables frequently regardless of their reaction. Even if your baby makes a face or spits out their veggies, don't give up. Studies show that it can take up to 10-15 tries before a baby will accept a new food.\n\n3. Sneak vegetables into meal times. If you're still at the spoon-feeding phase and your baby is not interested in eating vegetables on their own, you can try sneaking pureed vegetables into their favorite foods like mashed potatoes or oatmeal.\n\n4. Establish a mealtime routine. Babies and young children thrive on routine, so try to make meal times consistent and predictable. This can help your baby feel more comfortable and relaxed during meal times, which can in turn make it easier for them to try new foods.\n\n5. Limit snacks to make eating vegetables more rewarding. If your baby is snacking throughout the day, they may not be hungry enough to try new foods at meal times. Limit snacks and offer vegetables as a reward for finishing their meal or as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack.\n\n6. Dress vegetables up to be fun. Try making mealtime less about a power struggle and more about imagination. Cut vegetables into fun shapes, arrange them into a smiley face, or serve them with a favorite dip.\n\n7. Show your baby that vegetables are good. This is as simple as eating them yourself and enjoying them in front of your baby. Babies are natural imitators and are more likely to try something new if they see their parents enjoying it.\n\n8. Change up your vegetables. Don't try to feed your baby the same thing every day until they eat it. Rotate between different vegetables to keep things interesting and to introduce your baby to new flavors and textures.\n\n9. Use stories to encourage your baby to eat vegetables. If you like to read to your baby, try reading stories that encourage healthy habits or feature characters who enjoy eating vegetables.\n\n10. Hide vegetables in tasty meals or treats. Even as adults, many people refuse to eat certain vegetables. Try incorporating pureed vegetables into muffins, pancakes, or smoothies for a healthier twist on classic treats.\n\nWith these tips, your baby will be well on their way to becoming a vegetable lover in no time!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":74}
{"text":"Autism is a developmental disorder that affects the social, communication, and behavioral skills of individuals. While many people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can enjoy exercising, some may find it challenging to engage in physical activity due to difficulties with motivation, coordination, and sensory sensitivities. If you're looking for ways to encourage an autistic teen or adult to exercise, here are some tips to help:\n\nMethod 1: Creating a Calm and Natural Environment\n\n1. Make Sure the Exercise Environment is Calm and Natural\n\nFor many autistic people, exercise can be over-stimulating and uncomfortable if the environment is too loud or bright. To avoid sensory overload, create a calm and natural exercise environment that's quiet, dimly lit, and free of distractions.\n\n2. Try Giving Visual Instructions to Promote Learning\n\nVisual aids, such as pictures, diagrams, and videos, can be more effective than verbal instructions for learning new exercises. Break down complex movements into smaller steps and show them how to do it.\n\n3. Provide Lots of Encouragement to Create a Supportive Environment\n\nEncourage your loved one to exercise by using positive reinforcement. Cheer them on, give high fives, and create a sense of accomplishment. If they struggle, encourage them to keep trying and remind them that progress takes time.\n\nMethod 2: Making Exercise Fun\n\n4. Figure Out Their Passions to Make Exercise Seem Fun\n\nFind out what your loved one is passionate about and try to incorporate exercise into their interests. For example, if they love animals, take them for a walk in the park or explore nature together. If they enjoy music, encourage them to dance or move to the rhythm.\n\n5. Make Sure to Give Immediate Feedback to Create a Sense of Accomplishment\n\nAutistic individuals often have difficulty with gratification, so it's important to provide immediate feedback to reinforce progress. Let them know how well they're doing, and encourage them to keep going.\n\n6. Get Involved in the Special Olympics to Provide a Competitive Outlet\n\nParticipating in the Special Olympics can give autistic individuals a sense of purpose and community. Contact your local chapter to see if they offer any sports that your loved one can get involved in.\n\n7. Encourage Dancing to Have Fun While Exercising\n\nDancing is a fun way for autistic individuals to improve their coordination and motor skills while promoting social interaction. Encourage them to try different styles or dance to their favorite songs.\n\nMethod 3: Adapting to Unique Learning Needs\n\n8. Try Martial Arts to Encourage Exercise That Promotes Discipline and Focus\n\nMartial arts can be a great way for autistic individuals to improve their focus, discipline, and physical coordination. Find a class that accommodates your loved one's needs and abilities.\n\n9. Incorporate a Reward Into Your Routine\n\nCreate a reward system to encourage exercise. This could include anything from watching a favorite movie or going to a favorite restaurant once a specific exercise goal has been achieved.\n\n10. Try Prompting and Fading to Help Your Loved One Learn a Skill\n\nBreaking down exercises into smaller steps and providing visual prompts can help your loved one learn new skills. Over time, you can fade out the prompts and encourage them to do the exercise on their own.\n\nMethod 4: Understanding Autistic Individuals' Unique Challenges and Benefits\n\n11. Know That Autistic People May Be Disinterested in Things Beyond Their Special Interests\n\nPeople with autism often have intense interests in specific topics, and they may be disinterested in activities that fall outside of these interests. Encourage exercise that aligns with their special interests to make it more enjoyable.\n\n12. Understand the Presence of Impaired Motor Skills\n\nImpaired motor skills can make it challenging for autistic individuals to coordinate movements required for exercise. Start with simple movements and gradually increase the intensity to build stamina.\n\n13. Take Note of Sensory Sensitivities\n\nAutistic individuals may experience sensory sensitivities that make exercise uncomfortable or overwhelming. Encourage exercise that takes sensory sensitivities into account, such as low-impact movements or exercises in less stimulating environments.\n\n14. Understand That Having Difficulty Planning May Be Discouraging\n\nAutistic individuals may find it challenging to plan exercise routines, which can be discouraging. Help them create a schedule and plan that works for them.\n\n15. Be Aware of Social Impairments\n\nAutistic individuals may experience challenges with social interaction, which can impact their willingness to exercise with others. Encourage solo exercise or find group exercise options that are inclusive and supportive.\n\n16. Realize That Exercise Helps Autistic Individuals Maintain a Healthy Weight\n\nIt's essential to maintain a healthy weight to prevent health issues. Encourage exercise as a means to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n17. Be Aware of the Social Benefits of Exercise\n\nExercise can promote social interactions and create a sense of community, which can be beneficial for autistic individuals. Let them know that the exercise also serves social benefits.\n\n18. Recognize That Exercise May Moderate Stimming\n\nStimming, or self-stimulatory behaviors, may be reduced by exercise. Encourage exercise where individuals can relieve their stress.\n\n19. Know That Exercise May Help Alleviate the Side Effects of Medication\n\nExercise can help relieve the side effects of medication by promoting health and wellness. Encourage exercise where individuals can relieve their medication\u2019s side effects.\n\n20. Consider That Exercise Can Promote Self-Esteem\n\nExercise can promote self-esteem and confidence because of the accomplishments that come with exercising. Encourage and motivate individuals to leave their comfort zone.\n\nOverall, there are many ways to encourage an autistic teen or adult to exercise.

{"text":"Giving up sins is an essential part of the Muslim faith. In Islam, sin is considered to be any action or behavior that goes against the teachings of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). For a Muslim, the ultimate goal is to seek forgiveness for sins and purify one's soul. If you are a Muslim who is struggling to give up sin, here are some tips to help you on your journey:\n\n1. Stop indulging in sin.\n\nThe first step in giving up sin is to stop indulging in it. This requires a conscious effort to identify your sinful habits, and actively work to break these habits. This can be a challenging process, but it is a necessary one.\n\n2. Abstain from all sins, out of love for Allah Ta\u2019ala.\n\nThe reason you are giving up sin is out of your love for Allah Ta\u2019ala. This love should motivate you to strive to please Allah and abstain from those actions that displease Him.\n\n3. Develop the conscious awareness that Allah Ta\u2019ala is with us: He is watching us, He is hearing us, He knows all and everything about us; We cannot hide from Him; We cannot conceal our actions from Him.\n\nOne of the greatest motivators for giving up sin is the realization that Allah Ta\u2019ala is always watching us. This consciousness of Allah's presence should make us think twice before doing something that is sinful.\n\n4. Remember the angels too are witness to all our actions; that the earth is recording our behaviour and that all of it is also noted in our books of deeds \u2013 that we are accountable to Allah Ta\u2019ala on the Day of Judgement.\n\nIn addition to Allah Ta\u2019ala, the angels and the earth are also witnesses to our actions. Everything we do is being recorded and will be held accountable for on the Day of Judgment.\n\n5. Reflect daily.\n\nReflecting on our actions each day can help us become more aware of our behavior. This reflection can help us identify any sinful habits and take action to break them.\n\n6. Ponder over the fact that the Angel of Death does not give respite.\n\nThe Angel of Death will come for each one of us without fail. This realization should serve as a reminder for us to live a life free from sin and seek forgiveness from Allah Ta\u2019ala.\n\n7. Ponder over the fact that Allah Ta\u2019ala has blessed us with the gift of sight, hearing, health, wealth, and so much else \u2013 and has also granted us the gift of respect.\n\nAllah Ta\u2019ala has blessed us with countless gifts in this life.

{"text":"How to Solve Systems of Differential Equations\n\nSolving systems of differential equations can be a complex mathematical process, but by breaking it down into steps, it can become more manageable. This article will walk you through the process of solving systems of differential equations, including writing the system of differential equations in matrix form, finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, arriving at the general solution, and finding the Jordan normal form.\n\nPart 1: Writing the System of Differential Equations in Matrix Form\n\n1. Identify the system of differential equations. The first step in solving a system of differential equations is to identify the system you want to solve. For example, let's say you want to solve the following system of differential equations:\n\n         x' = 3x + 2y\n         y' = -2x + 3y\n\n2. Write the system in matrix form. Once you have identified the system of differential equations you want to solve, write it in matrix form. To do this, you will write the coefficients of the x and y terms as a matrix. In our example, we would write:\n\n         [x']   [3    2]   [x]\n         [y'] = [-2   3] * [y]\n\n3. Simplify the matrix. Next, simplify the matrix by multiplying it out: \n\n         [x'] = [3x + 2y]\n         [y']   [-2x + 3y]\n\nPart 2: Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\n\n4. Find the eigenvalues of the matrix. To find the eigenvalues of the matrix, you will solve the characteristic equation of the matrix. The characteristic equation is:\n\n         det(A - \u03bbI) = 0\n\nWhere A is the matrix, \u03bb is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix. In our example, the characteristic equation is:\n\n         det([3-\u03bb  2]\n             [-2  3-\u03bb]) = 0\n\nSolve for \u03bb by setting the determinant equal to 0 and solving for \u03bb:\n\n         (3-\u03bb)(3-\u03bb) - (-2)(2) = 0\n         \u03bb^2 - 6\u03bb + 13 = 0\n         \u03bb = 3 \u00b1 2i\n\n5. Go through the three cases. Next, go through the three cases to determine the type of eigenvalue and the associated eigenvectors. The three cases are:\n\n         Case 1: Real and distinct eigenvalues (e.g. \u03bb1 = 2, \u03bb2 = 3)\n         Case 2: Complex conjugate eigenvalues (e.g. \u03bb1 = 3+2i, \u03bb2 = 3-2i)\n         Case 3: Real and repeated eigenvalues (e.g. \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 3)\n\n6. Find the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues. Once you have determined the type of eigenvalue, you can find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue. In general, the eigenvector equation is:\n\n         (A - \u03bbI)x = 0\n\nWhere x is the eigenvector. In our example, the eigenvectors associated with 3+2i and 3-2i are:\n\n         [1]\n         [i] \n\nAnd the eigenvector associated with 3 is:\n\n         [1]\n         [0]\n\nPart 3: Arriving at the General Solution\n\n7. Write the eigenvalues in terms of their real and imaginary components. Before arriving at the general solution, write the eigenvalues in terms of their real and imaginary components to simplify the final solution. In our example, the eigenvalues are:\n\n         \u03bb1 = 3 + 2i\n         \u03bb2 = 3 - 2i\n\n8. Find the eigenvector associated with one eigenvalue. Next, find the eigenvector associated with one of the eigenvalues. In our example, we will use the eigenvector associated with \u03bb1:\n\n         x1 = [1]\n              [i]\n\n9. Write out the first term of the solution to the system. To begin writing the general solution to the system, write out the first term of the solution using the eigenvector associated with \u03bb1:\n\n         x1(t) = [1]e^(3+2i)t\n                 [i]\n\n10. Use Euler's formula to split the imaginary exponential into its trigonometric components. Euler's formula states that:\n\n         e^ix = cos(x) + i*sin(x)\n\nUsing Euler's formula, we can split the imaginary exponential into its trigonometric components:\n\n         e^(3+2i)t = e^(3t) * e^(2it)\n                   = e^(3t) * (cos(2t) + i*sin(2t))\n\n11. Multiply out the expression. Next, multiply out the expression using the trigonometric components:\n\n         x1(t) = [e^(3t) * cos(2t) + ie^(3t) * sin(2t)]\n                 [e^(3t) * sin(2t) - ie^(3t) * cos(2t)]\n\n12. Arrive at the general solution. Finally, use the eigenvectors associated with the other eigenvalue and the principle of superposition to arrive at the general solution:\n\n         x(t) = c1 * [e^(3t) * cos(2t)] + c2 * [e^(3t) * sin(2t)]\n                + c3 * [e^(3t)]\n                + c4 * [e^(3t) * t] \n\nPart 4: Finding the Jordan Normal Form\n\n13. Try to find all eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue. If the matrix is not diagonalizable, try to find all of the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalue. In our example, we can see that the matrix is diagonalizable, so we do not need to find the generalized eigenvectors.\n\n14. Use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to find the generalized eigenvector. If the matrix is not diagonalizable, use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to find the generalized eigenvector. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that a matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation:\n\n         A^2 - tr(A)A + det(A)I = 0\n\nWhere tr(A) is the trace of the matrix and det(A) is the determinant of the matrix. This equation can be rewritten as:\n\n         (A - \u03bbI)^2 * v = 0\n\nWhere \u03bb is the eigenvalue and v is the generalized eigenvector. \n\n15. Find the generalized eigenvector. To find the generalized eigenvector, solve the equation:\n\n         (A - \u03bbI)^2 * v = 0\n\nIn our example, the generalized eigenvectors are:\n\n         [1]   [0]\n         [0]   [1]\n\n16. Solve for w. Next, solve for w in the equation:\n\n         (A - \u03bbI)w = v\n\nIn our example, the solution for w is:\n\n         [2]\n         [-2] \n\n17. Arrive at the general solution. Finally, use the eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors to arrive at the general solution:\n\n         x(t) = c1 * [e^(3t) * cos(2t)] + c2 * [e^(3t) * sin(2t)]\n                + c3 * [e^(3t) * (2t + 1)]\n                + c4 * [e^(3t) * (2t - 2)] \n\nPart 5: Diagonalizing the Matrix\n\n18. Consider the matrix equation x' = Ax. To diagonalize the matrix, we need to consider the matrix equation:\n\n         x' = Ax\n\nWhere x is a vector of functions and A is the matrix of coefficients.\n\n19. Find eAt. Next, find the exponential of the matrix A by using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n\n         eAt = P * eD * P^-1\n\nWhere P is the matrix of eigenvectors and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. In our example, the matrix P is:\n\n         [1  1]\n         [i -i]\n\nAnd the matrix D is:\n\n         [3+2i  0]\n         [0    3-2i]\n\n20. Diagonalize A. Diagonalize A by finding the inverse of the matrix P and multiplying everything out:\n\n         A = PDP^-1\n\nIn our example, the diagonalized matrix A is:\n\n         [3+2i  0]\n         [0    3-2i]\n\n21. Find eDt and then multiply everything all out. To find eDt, use the diagonlaized matrix D and the formula:\n\n         eDt = diag(e^(\u03bb1*t), e^(\u03bb2*t), ..., e^(\u03bbn*t))\n\nWhere \u03bb are the eigenvalues. In our example, the matrix eDt is:\n\n         [e^(3+2i)t  0]\n         [0           e^(3-2i)t]\n\nTo arrive at the final diagonalized solution, multiply everything out by using the inverse matrix of P:\n\n         x(t) = P * eDt * P^-1 * x0\n\nPart 6: Finding the Jordan Normal Form\n\n22. Try to diagonalize A. If it is not possible to diagonalize the matrix, find the Jordan normal form instead. \n\n23. Find the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvectors. To find the Jordan normal form, find the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvectors of the matrix.\n\n24. Find the Jordan normal form of A. The Jordan normal form is:\n\n         J = P^-1 * A * P\n\nWhere P is the matrix of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors, and J is the Jordan normal form. \n\n25. Find eAt. To find eAt, use the Jordan blocks and the matrix exponential formula:\n\n         eAt = P * diag(e^(J1*t), e^(J2*t), ..., e^(Jn*t)) * P^-1\n\nWhere J is the Jordan normal form.\n\nConclusion\n\nSolving systems of differential equations may seem daunting, but by following the steps outlined in this article, you can attain the general solution quickly and efficiently. Remember to take your time, and double-check your calculations along the way!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":84}

{"text":"How to Use Advanced First-Person Shooter Game Strategies\n\nFirst-person shooter games can be incredibly exciting and fast-paced, but they can also be incredibly frustrating and difficult to master. If you're looking to take your game to the next level, there are a few advanced strategies and techniques you can use to improve your chances of success. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most effective strategies for first-person shooter game play.\n\nMap Your Carny Holes Before You Start the Level\n\nCarny holes are small nooks and crannies in a level that can improve your tactical standing. Before you start a new level, take time to explore and map out these areas. Knowing where these hidden spots are can give you an edge over your opponents and help you survive longer.\n\nUse Splash\n\nIf you have a rocket launcher or splash weapon at your disposal, aim for your opponent's feet instead of their torso or head. This will cause them to stumble, giving you an opening to finish them off.\n\nUse Baseball\n\nSome games include a splash melee weapon, such as a baseball bat or hammer. These can be incredibly effective in close combat situations, so don't hesitate to use them when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nUse the Bouncer\n\nWhen using grenades, lead your enemies by throwing them to the spot where your target will be, not where they currently are. This will increase your chances of dealing splash damage and taking out multiple enemies at once.\n\nUse the Tapper\n\nWhen firing a machine gun or dual machine guns at long range, tapping the trigger can help you maximize your damage output and conserve ammunition.\n\nClear Screen Tactics\n\nNever underestimate the power of a small weapon. When you're in close quarters, use a small gun or melee weapon to take out enemies quickly.\n\nUse Screen Peeping\n\nThe best players are screen peepers, those who are able to use their peripheral vision to keep an eye on their opponents' movements. This will give you an edge over your opponents and help you stay one step ahead.\n\nTake Advantage of Visual Pollution\n\nSome games allow you to throw weapons, creating a visual disturbance that can throw your enemies off balance. Use this tactic to your advantage whenever possible.\n\nUnderstand Hierarchy\n\nIt's essential to have a firm understanding of the weapons that are effective and those that are not. Learn which weapons are weak and avoid using them in favor of stronger alternatives.\n\nFeign Death\n\nIn some shooters, you can feign death to lull your enemies into a false sense of security. Use this tactic to your advantage by waiting patiently for your opponents to approach before striking.\n\nStrafe Melees\n\nSome shooters allow you to perform strafe melees, which are powerful attacks that work best against new players with low sensitivity settings.\n\nUse Grenade Donkey Punch\n\nSome shooters allow you to knock back opponents with splash damage from your grenades. Use this tactic to your advantage to create distance between you and your enemies.\n\nUse Grenade Jumps\n\nGrenade jumps are a common tactic in many shooters, but they are often misused. Use them strategically to gain access to hard-to-reach areas and surprise your opponents.\n\nControl Sensitivity\n\nIncreasing your control sensitivity can help you turn and aim more quickly, giving you an edge in combat situations. Experiment with different sensitivity settings until you find the one that works best for you.\n\nUse Flag Armor\n\nIf your enemy is carrying a flag, slowly sneak up on them and shoot them from behind. This tactic is incredibly effective and will catch many players off guard.\n\nSneak Around\n\nIn some FPS games, one team has objectives that can be captured. Sneak around and try to capture these objectives while avoiding your opponents. This can be a risky tactic, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.\n\nIn conclusion, mastering advanced first-person shooter game strategies takes practice, patience, and a willingness to experiment and learn from your mistakes. Incorporate these tactics into your game play and watch your skills improve over time. Good luck and have fun!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":90}

This could include using social media, paid advertising, content marketing, and influencer marketing. Choose the tactics that work best for your business and target market. \n\nPart 11: Experiment with, But Don't Rely Solely on, PPC or Social\n\nWhile PPC or social media advertising can be effective, it\u2019s important not to rely solely on them. Experiment with other forms of advertising, like email marketing and content marketing, to reach your target market. \n\nPart 12: Arrange a Way for Customers to Access and Buy Your Products\n\nMake it easy for customers to access and buy your products. This could include setting up an online store, selling on third-party platforms like Etsy or Amazon, or offering local pickup or delivery. \n\nPart 13: Consider Creating Your Own Website\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about selling products from home, you may want to consider creating your own website. This gives you more control over your brand, your website design, and your sales process. \n\nPart 14: Sell Your Product on eBay\n\neBay can be a great platform for selling products from home. It\u2019s easy to set up an account and start selling, and there\u2019s a huge audience of potential customers. \n\nPart 15: Sell on Amazon\n\nAmazon is another popular platform for selling products from home.

{"text":"Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are an essential component of modern electronics. While you can buy pre-made PCBs, creating your own can be a fun and rewarding experience. This article will guide you through the steps to create your own custom PCB.\n\nPart 1: Choose a method to use for creating the PCB.\n\nThere are two primary methods for creating PCBs: the toner transfer method and the photoresist method. For the toner transfer method, you will need a laser printer and some transfer paper. For the photoresist method, you will need a photosensitive PCB card, a UV insulator, and a transparent sheet.\n\nPart 2: Create the PCB Layout of your circuit.\n\nBefore you can create your PCB, you need to design the layout of your circuit. You can use software such as Eagle, Altium or KiCad to create the schematic and layout. Once you are happy with the schematic on your computer, match the size of the diagram on the software so that both the circuit board and the paper will have the needed sizes.\n\nPart 3: Transfer the Layout.\n\nFor the toner transfer method, you need to print out the diagram from the software's File menu onto transfer paper. Align the circuit diagram on the paper with the circuit board (the diagram should be facing the copper part of the circuit board). Once heated, carefully place the iron on top of the paper which is on top of the circuit board. Place the iron there for about 30-45 seconds (depending on your iron).\n\nAfter lifting the iron, put it aside carefully and take the circuit board to your nearest source of water. Start the water flow and hold the circuit board below it. Slowly start taking off the paper, and soon, all of the paper should come off. Dry the board.\n\nFor the photoresist method, you need to draw the PCB layout on a transparent sheet with a laser printer, in positive or negative mode, according to the photosensitive coating of the card. Cover the copper side of the board with the printed transparent sheet. Place the board in the UV insulator machine\/chamber, turn on the UV machine and wait. Once done, remove the board from the UV insulator.\n\nPart 4: Etching the board.\n\nFor both methods, you need to etch the board. You need to choose an etching acid and prepare the acid etchant. Submerge the board in the acid, making sure to stir every 3-5 minutes. Take the board out and wash it when all unnecessary copper is etched away from the board. Remove the insulating drawing material used.\n\nPart 5: Drill mount points.\n\nDrill the mount points for the electronic components.\n\nPart 6: Mount and solder the electronic components on the board.\n\nPlace the electronic components and solder them into place.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow you to create your own custom PCB. With a bit of practice, this can be a fun and rewarding experience.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":94}

{"text":"Have you been struggling with bedwetting and are tired of constantly washing sheets and blankets? Have you considered using plastic sheeting as a bedwetting sheet but don't know where to start? Look no further than your local hardware store - with a roll of plastic sheeting and a few household items, you can create your own bedwetting sheet in no time.\n\nSteps\n\n1. Go to a hardware store such as Ace, Lowes, or Home Depot and purchase a roll of plastic sheeting.\n\n2. Once you get the roll of plastic home, gather a utility knife or pair of scissors to cut the plastic sheet.\n\n3. Determine the size of your bed - whether it is twin, double, queen, or king size - and cut the plastic sheet to fit the size of the mattress.\n\n4. Cover the bed with the plastic sheet, placing it directly on top of the box spring. Make sure to smooth out any wrinkles or bumps in the plastic.\n\n5. After covering the box spring with the plastic, place one of the fitted mattress pads over the plastic. Then, cover it with the fitted top sheet.\n\n6. Periodically check the plastic for any wear and tear. If any tears or holes are found, repair or replace the plastic immediately.\n\n7. Put the plastic over the bed for a period of time and ask the bedwetter how they feel about it. Adjust the plastic as necessary to ensure comfort and effectiveness.\n\n8. As an alternative to hardware store plastic sheeting, consider using vinyl sheeting sold at craft stores such as Jo Anne Fabrics as a waterproof covering.\n\n9. Even with the plastic sheet, it's still a good idea to have the bedwetter wear diapers for added protection.\n\n10. Besides using the plastic for a bedwetting sheet, it can be used for numerous household tasks such as drop cloths for painting, covering outside materials such as firewood and mulch, for remodeling projects, yard work, and many other jobs.\n\nBy following these simple steps, you can create your own bedwetting sheet using plastic sheeting from your local hardware store. Not only will this help save time and money on laundry, but it can also provide peace of mind for those struggling with bedwetting.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":99}

{"text":"Emotional distress can be debilitating and may occur as a result of many potentially traumatic experiences, such as physical or emotional abuse, sexual assault, or workplace harassment. If you are experiencing emotional distress, you may want to consider suing the responsible party for damages. However, suing for emotional distress can be a complicated and difficult process. Here are the steps you need to take to sue for emotional distress.\n\nPart 1: Before You Sue\n1. Familiarize yourself with the types of emotional distress claims. Emotional distress claims generally fall into one of two categories: negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Negligent infliction of emotional distress occurs when someone acts carelessly and causes emotional distress. Intentional infliction of emotional distress occurs when someone intentionally acts to cause distress, such as with harassment or abuse.\n\n2. Determine if emotional distress was negligently inflicted. If you are considering suing for emotional distress, the first thing you will need to do is determine whether the emotional distress was negligently inflicted. This will require you to show that the person responsible for your emotional distress acted carelessly and that their actions caused you harm.\n\n3. Determine if emotional distress was intentionally inflicted. If you believe that someone intentionally acted to cause your emotional distress, you will need to prove that this was the case. This will require you to provide evidence of the person's intent to cause harm.\n\n4. Keep a record of physical symptoms. Emotional distress can cause physical symptoms, such as headaches, stomach problems, or sleep disturbances. Keep a record of any physical symptoms that you experience as a result of your emotional distress.\n\n5. Determine what role physical injury played in your situation. If you have physical injuries that were caused by the incident that led to your emotional distress, this may play a role in your case. You will need to show that the physical injury contributed to your emotional distress.\n\n6. Show the link between physical harm and prolonged emotional symptoms. If you have physical injuries that were caused by the incident that led to your emotional distress, you will need to show how the physical injury caused prolonged emotional symptoms.\n\n7. See if you can sue for emotional distress as a third party. In some cases, you may be able to sue for emotional distress even if you were not the direct victim. For example, if you witnessed a loved one being injured, you may be able to sue for emotional distress.\n\nPart 2: Preparing Your Case\n1. Assemble your medical records. Your medical records will be important evidence in your case. Make sure you compile all your relevant medical records, including records of any treatment you received for your emotional distress.\n\n2. Write down an account of what happened. Write down a detailed account of the incident that led to your emotional distress, including any behavior or actions that caused you harm.\n\n3. Hire a lawyer to take a look at your case. You will need a lawyer to help you sue for emotional distress. Find a lawyer who specializes in personal injury cases and who has experience with emotional distress claims.\n\n4. Ask your lawyer about the likelihood of recovering damages. Your lawyer will be able to tell you how strong your case is and how likely you are to recover damages.\n\n5. Make sure it's not too late to sue. There is a statute of limitations on emotional distress claims. Make sure you file your claim within the appropriate timeframe.\n\n6. Find out where you will file your suit. Depending on the circumstances of your case, you may need to file your suit in a specific court.\n\n7. Fill out the complaint. Your lawyer will help you fill out the legal complaint that will initiate your lawsuit.\n\n8. File your complaint. Once you have filled out the complaint, your lawyer will file it with the appropriate court.\n\n9. Wait for the defendant's written answer. The defendant will have a specified amount of time to write a response to your complaint.\n\nPart 3: Moving Forward With Your Case\n1. Begin the \"discovery\" process. The discovery process is a period of time when both sides are allowed to gather evidence. Your lawyer will help guide you through this process.\n\n2. Give a deposition if requested. If the defendant requests a deposition, you will need to provide testimony under oath. Your lawyer will prepare you for this process.\n\n3. Have your lawyer file motions with the court. Your lawyer may file a number of motions with the court to help build your case.\n\n4. Consider reaching a settlement agreement. In some cases, it may be in your best interest to settle your case outside of court.\n\n5. Meet with a legal mediator. A legal mediator can help you and the defendant reach an agreement without going to court.\n\n6. Stay informed with the process. Stay in communication with your lawyer and keep up-to-date on the progress of your case.\n\n7. Decide if you should take your case to trial. If you are unable to reach a settlement, you may need to take your case to trial.\n\n8. Work with your attorney to prepare. If you do go to trial, your lawyer will help you prepare for it.\n\n9. Attend the trial if you haven't settled. If your case goes to trial, you will need to attend the proceedings and testify under oath. Your lawyer will be by your side to guide you through the process.\n\nSuing for emotional distress can be a difficult and lengthy process, but with the right preparation and legal counsel, you can recover damages for the harm that you have suffered.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":101}
{"text":"Housebreaking an adult dog can be a daunting task, but with patience and the right mindset, it can be achieved successfully. One of the first things to keep in mind is that there are many possible reasons why a dog may eliminate inside the house. To begin the process, take your dog to a veterinarian to rule out any medical issues that may be causing problems.\n\nConsider recent subtractions and\/or additions to your home. Changes such as the addition of a new pet, or moving to a new home, can be stressful for dogs and affect their behavior. To help your dog adjust, provide him with plenty of exercise, patience, and time to adapt to the new environment.\n\nDetermine if fear or anxiety may be causing your dog's problems. Fear or anxiety can make it difficult for dogs to go outside or feel comfortable eliminating in a new location. To help ease your dog's fear or anxiety, try to create a positive environment for him outside and work on acclimating him with patience and consistency.\n\nIdentify any surface preferences your dog has and work to change them. Dogs often prefer to eliminate on specific surfaces, so if you can convince your dog to use grass instead of other surfaces like the carpet or tile, housebreaking will become much easier.\n\nDevelop a daily routine that includes regular walks or trips outside. Encourage your dog to use the same spot every time you take him outside. This consistency will allow your dog to establish a pattern and develop an association between going outside and eliminating.\n\nMonitor your dog at all times to ensure he does not have an accident inside the house. If you catch your dog in the act of eliminating indoors, quickly clap your hands to startle him and stop him in his tracks. Then, immediately take him outside to the designated spot, encouraging him to eliminate there.\n\nClean up messes as soon as they happen to avoid any lingering smells or stains that might encourage your dog to continue eliminating indoors. Praise your dog when he eliminates outside, giving him plenty of verbal encouragement as a reward.\n\nIf you know you will be gone for long periods, ask a neighbor or friend to take your dog outside. If your dog is struggling with any medical issues, follow your veterinarian's instructions for treatment. Similarly, if your dog is having difficulty adapting to new environments or surface preferences, consider getting help from a certified professional dog trainer.\n\nLastly, consider getting cold and\/or wet weather gear for your dog, so that he can eliminate outside regardless of the weather. Housebreaking an adult dog can be a challenge, but with patience, persistence, and consistency, it is possible to have a fully housebroken pet that eliminates outside on a regular schedule.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":102}

Here are some tips to help you pack your pickup truck for safe travel.\n\n1. Prepare your truck to make it easier to secure your cargo\n\nBefore packing your truck, make sure to clean the bed of your truck thoroughly. Remove any debris or dirt that may get in the way of packing your cargo. If your truck comes with tie-down hooks, make sure to use them to secure your load. You can also add additional tie-down anchors if needed.\n\n2. Use cargo netting for hauling light materials like insulation or lawn trash\n\nCargo netting is a great way to keep lightweight materials from flying out of the truck bed during transport. Place the netting over the top of the load and secure it to the truck bed using tie-downs or bungee cords.\n\n3. Buy a tarp sized for your load\n\nIf you are carrying loose items like soil, gravel, or sand, use a tarp to cover them and prevent them from scattering around the truck. Make sure the tarp is the right size for your load and secure it to the truck bed using bungee cords.\n\n4. Secure cargo to a pallet when it is loaded\n\nIf you're transporting heavy or bulky items, it's best to pack them on a pallet. This makes it easier to secure them using tie-downs or straps.\n\n5. Be aware that it is difficult to secure cargo in a truck bed in a fashion that will ensure its safety from a determined thief who has opportunity to access the truck unnoticed\n\nWhile it's important to secure your cargo to prevent it from falling off or shifting during transport, it's also important to be mindful of the risk of theft. If you're carrying valuable items like tools, consider installing a lockable toolbox or placing them behind the seats in the cab.\n\n6. Invest in quality ratchet straps for tying down heavy cargo\n\nRatchet straps are a great option for securing heavier loads. Make sure to invest in high-quality ratchet straps that are rated for the weight of your cargo.\n\n7. Tie your cargo down from at least two sides, securing ropes or straps to the load itself where possible, or crossing over the top in an X manner to prevent movement in all directions\n\nWhen tying down your cargo, make sure to secure it from at least two sides. This will prevent it from shifting or falling off the truck while you're on the move. You can secure ropes or straps directly to the load itself or cross them over the top in an X manner to prevent movement in all directions.\n\n8. Travel the smoothest, straightest path available\n\nTry to stick to smooth and straight paths when transporting your cargo. Avoid bumpy or uneven roads that can cause your load to shift or become unstable.\n\n9. Be aware of the load capacity of your truck\n\nMake sure you know the load capacity of your truck before loading it up. Overloading your truck can cause undue stress on the engine, suspension, and brakes, which can lead to accidents or damage to your vehicle.\n\n10. Tie a flag on unusually long loads, so other drivers will notice it overhanging the tailgate and avoid approaching too closely\n\nIf you're carrying unusually long items like ladders or pipes, it's important to tie a flag to them so that other drivers can see them and avoid approaching too closely. This will prevent accidents or damage to your truck and your load.\n\n11. Keep very heavy loads as far forward as possible\n\nIf you're carrying heavy items, it's best to place them as far forward as possible to prevent the front of the vehicle from becoming light and making steering less effective and more difficult. This will help you maintain better control of your truck and prevent accidents.\n\n12. Consider placing valuable tools and other items behind the seats in the cab\n\nIf you're carrying valuable items like tools, consider placing them behind the seats in the cab. This will prevent them from being stolen or damaged during transport.\n\nBy following these tips, you can ensure that your pickup truck is packed safely and securely for a long journey.

{"text":"Learning and understanding the physiology behind the inhibition of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme is crucial, especially in the field of medicine and chemical warfare. In this article, we will discuss the physiological process involved in the inhibition of this enzyme and how it affects the body.\n\nUnderstanding Acetylcholine and Acetylcholinesterase\n\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons and muscles. It is essential for proper muscle function and is a crucial component of the autonomic nervous system. The production of acetylcholine occurs in the pre-synaptic neurons and is stored in vesicles.\n\nAcetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine. It is present in the synaptic cleft, which is the space between the pre-synaptic neuron and the post-synaptic muscle. The role of this enzyme is to terminate the activity of acetylcholine by breaking it down into choline and acetate. This ensures that there is no prolonged muscle activity, which can lead to muscle fatigue.\n\nThe Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase\n\nThe inhibition of acetylcholinesterase results in the accumulation of acetylcholine, leading to an overstimulation of muscles. This can cause muscle contraction, which can become persistent and produce adverse effects on the body. One of the main causes of acetylcholinesterase inhibition is the use of organophosphate compounds, which are chemicals used in pesticides and chemical warfare.\n\nOrganophosphates inhibit acetylcholinesterase by forming a covalent bond with the enzyme. This covalent bond leads to a permanent inhibition of the enzyme, which can lead to prolonged muscle contraction. This can cause serious clinical effects such as respiratory muscle paralysis and death.\n\nUnderstanding the Physiology Behind Enzyme Inhibition\n\nEnzyme inhibition is the process of reducing or blocking the activity of an enzyme. This process can occur either reversibly or irreversibly. In the case of acetylcholinesterase, organophosphates cause irreversible inhibition by forming a strong covalent bond with the enzyme.\n\nThe mechanism behind enzyme inhibition occurs through the alteration of the enzyme's catalytic site. This alteration can lead to a change in the conformation of the enzyme, affecting its ability to catalyze specific reactions.\n\nConclusion\n\nInhibition of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme is a serious physiological process that can lead to severe clinical symptoms. Understanding the mechanism behind this process can help in developing effective treatments for poisoning caused by organophosphates. It can also aid in developing better methods of chemical warfare prevention. By learning and understanding the physiology behind the inhibition of the acetylcholine esterase enzyme, we can work towards bettering the health and safety of individuals around the world.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":111}

{"text":"How to Sue for Infringement of Digital Intellectual Property\n\nIf you believe that your intellectual property, such as copyrighted material, has been infringed upon on a digital platform, you have the right to take legal action. To do so, you must be aware of the steps involved in suing for infringement of digital intellectual property. Here's what you need to know.\n\nPart 1: Preparing Your Case\n\n1. Understand what constitutes infringement. Digital intellectual property infringement occurs when someone, without your permission, uses, distributes, or reproduces your intellectual property. This includes your pictures, music, written works, or videos.\n\n2. Make sure the use isn't exempted from liability for infringement. Some uses might be considered \"fair use,\" which are non-infringing activities of copyrighted materials, such as commentary, criticism, or parody. Determine if your work falls under this category and decide on your course of action.\n\n3. Take screen captures of your work on the infringer\u2019s website. Before you pursue legal action, it's important to have evidence of the infringement. Take screenshots of the infringing material and the website as a whole for future reference.\n\n4. Get direct links to your work. The infringing material might be a repost or simply linked to your original content. Get the direct links to prove the infringement.\n\n5. Check the date your work was posted against the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations varies depending on the state and the type of case you're filing. Make sure that you're within the statute of limitations before taking legal action.\n\n6. Check the website on whois. Look up the infringing website on whois to find out who owns the website and their contact information.\n\n7. Research online to learn the website\u2019s internet visibility. Gain an idea of how many people are visiting the website and how much revenue they are making from your work.\n\n8. Find out if the site owner is using any promotions or advertising. Note any promotions or advertising the infringing website might be using. This can work solid evidence in court.\n\n9. Contact the site owner. Reach out to the owner of the website and ask them to remove the infringing content. This can be done via email, phone, or traditional mail.\n\n10. Hire an attorney to send a formal, curtly-worded cease-and-desist letter. If the owner doesn't respond, consider seeking legal counsel and have them send a formal, curtly-worded cease-and-desist letter.\n\nPart 2: Filing a Lawsuit\n\n1. Send notice to the DMCA agent of the website\u2019s host regarding specific content. Use the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to send a notice to the website's internet host to remove your intellectual property. Ensure you have all relevant proof prepared prior to filing.\n\n2. Send notice to the website\u2019s ISP. Contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP) hosting the infringing website and send them a notice that they are illegally hosting copyrighted material.\n\n3. Fill out an application for copyright registration. Copyright registration will provide additional protection that may be necessary in court. Fill out an application through the United States Copyright Office.\n\n4. Pay the filing fee. Once you complete the application for copyright registration, there will be a fee to pay. Check the fee on the US Copyright Office website.\n\n5. Include deposit copies. Along with the application, you must include deposit copies of your work. These can be in the form of physical or digital copies.\n\n6. Consider requesting expedited processing. Expedited processing might be necessary to protect your digital intellectual property. If that's the case, consider requesting expedited processing.\n\n7. Find a copyright attorney. Only an experienced copyright lawyer can help you navigate the legal process of suing for digital intellectual property infringement. Search for local copyright attorneys online.\n\n8. Strategize with your attorney. Your attorney will guide you through the further steps of the legal process, which include filing a complaint, beginning discovery, and sitting for a deposition.\n\n9. Draft the complaint. A complaint is a legal document that outlines the nature of the case, the legal theory of the case, and the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. Your attorney will help you draft the complaint.\n\n10. File the complaint in court. Once your complaint is prepared, file it in court.\n\nPart 3: Going to Court\n\n1. Wait for the answer. The defendant will respond to the complaint with an answer.\n\n2. Confer with the other party. You and the defendant will meet to discuss the allegations in the complaint.\n\n3. Make initial disclosures. You will provide the other side with initial disclosures about the violations being claimed.\n\n4. Begin discovery. Discovery is a process by which the parties gather evidence to use in court.\n\n5. Sit for a deposition. A deposition is a sworn testimony outside of the court.\n\n6. File a motion for summary judgment, or defend against one. A motion for summary judgment requests that the judge dismiss the case.\n\n7. Participate in settlement negotiations. You and the defendant may resolve the case at any time.\n\n8. Consider mediation. Mediation is a non-binding alternative to resolving disputes outside of court.\n\n9. Select a jury. If the case moves forward up to the trial phase, the jury will be chosen.\n\n10. Deliver an opening statement, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and deliver closing arguments. These will be the key components of the trial process.\n\n11. Await the verdict. The judge or jury will render a verdict.

Research your project on the internet and in the library and bookstore.\nBefore embarking on any home improvement project, it is essential to do your research. The internet, library, and bookstore are excellent sources of information and can help you get ideas, understand the scope of the project, and learn the materials and tools you'll need.\n\n2. Before starting any large project, call the local building department and talk with an inspector.\nMany home improvement projects require permits or inspections, so it's a good idea to check with your local building department early in the planning process. The inspector can review your plans and advise you of any challenges or requirements you need to meet.\n\n3. Draw your project to scale on \u00bc-in.\nDrawing your project to scale using graph paper will help you visualize your plans and identify any potential problems.\n\n4. Keep the construction details as simple as possible to avoid mistakes and unanticipated problems.\nOvercomplicating a project can lead to mistakes and unanticipated problems. Keep your project details as simple as possible, especially if you're a beginner.\n\n5. Buy or rent all the tools you need \u2013 it's counterproductive to attempt a major project with second-rate equipment.\nMake sure you have all the necessary tools before you start your project. It's better to have high-quality tools than to have to work with subpar equipment.\n\n6. Get all the materials you need before starting your job to avoid time-wasting trips to the home center - and arrange for deliveries when possible.\nDon't start your project until you have all the supplies you need. Plan ahead and order materials in advance to avoid wasting time making trips to the home center.\n\n7. Find sources for good advice at the local hardware store or lumberyard.\nLocal hardware stores and lumberyards are often staffed by experts who can offer advice and answer questions about your project.\n\n8.

If you have to remove the only toilet in your house to re-tile, plan your work so you can reinstall it temporarily at the end of each day \u2013 all you need is a fresh wax ring and a few shims.\nIf your project requires you to remove basic necessities like the toilet, plan ahead so that you can reinstall them temporarily and still use them each day.\n\n11. If possible, break your job down into small sections and finish each one before moving on.\nRather than trying to tackle the entire project at once, break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces and complete each one before moving on.\n\n12. If you're following a guide or how-to book, detailed how-to instructions may not be completely clear on the first or second reading, but they'll start to make sense when you get more involved in the job.\nThe first time you read through a guide or tutorial, you may not fully grasp the steps involved, but as you dive deeper and progress through the project, the logic will start to make sense.\n\nPart 2: Execution\n\n1. There are two parts to every job \u2013 the satisfying rough work when you knock walls down or nail up big 4 x 8 sheets, and the sometimes frustrating finish work where you may spend hours on a few square inches.\nHome improvement projects involve two key components: rough work and finish work. Both are essential and require different approaches and skill sets.\n\n2. Buy extra materials and make practice cuts first when you do finish work.\nWhen it comes to finish work, it's essential to get it right the first time. Buy extra materials to ensure you have enough and practice your cuts on scrap materials before making them on your finished product.\n\nBy following these tips and guidelines, you can enjoy a successful home improvement project and improve the look and functionality of your home.

{"text":"Installing outdoor electric wiring can be intimidating, but it's essential if you want to have an outdoor lighting system or power source. The first step is to determine which method is the most desirable: direct burial of cable under soil, PVC electrical pipe (PVC) buried under soil with conductors installed in the pipe, or aerial method.\n\nMethod 1: Direct Burial of Cable Under Soil\n\nDirect burial of type \"UF\" cable under soil is probably the most common and least expensive method. Before you begin, you must check with your local code requirements to verify if the direct burial method is permitted in your area.\n\nStep 1: Dig a trench for the cable\n\nDig a trench at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep along the route you have chosen for the cable. This will ensure that the cable is below the frost line.\n\nStep 2: Lay the cable\n\nAfter ensuring the minimum depth along the entire length, lay type \"UF\" cable in the trench.\n\nStep 3: Support the cable\n\nUF cable must be supported every 30\u201336 inches (76.2\u201391.4 cm); just like NM cable. Use approved cable supports for this purpose.\n\nStep 4: Backfill the trench\n\nDo NOT backfill the trench until the electrical inspector or \"authority having jurisdiction\" (AHJ) has checked the work.\n\nMethod 2: PVC Electrical Pipe Buried Under Soil\n\nThe PVC pipe method allows for adding circuits at will without the labor or expense of excavating again. You will need a trench that is at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep for the pipe.\n\nStep 1: Lay the PVC pipe\n\nLay the PVC pipe in the trench, ensuring that it rises above the ground at the right intervals (30 to 36 inches or 76.2 to 91.4 cm) and is supported with approved supports for the pipe.\n\nStep 2: Add expansion joint\n\nA PVC \"expansion joint\" is often required between the point the pipe emerges from the ground outdoors and penetrates a wall or enters an enclosure mounted on the wall.\n\nStep 3: Pull conductors through\n\nPush the \"fish tape\" or \"snake\" in one end of the pipe until it exits the opposite end. Hook the conductors to the snake and tape together. Pull them through the pipe.\n\nStep 4: Backfill the trench\n\nDo NOT backfill the trench until the wiring inspector has checked your work.\n\nMethod 3: Aerial Method\n\nThe aerial installations should only be done for short lateral runs, and where they may be installed so that traffic (vehicle or pedestrian) below will not create a hazard by contact. Type UF cable is suitable for an aerial run when used with approved strain relief fittings because Type UF cable is rated as \/ and accepted to be sunlight & moisture resistant.\n\nStep 1: Determine the route\n\nDetermine the route for your aerial installation and ensure that it will not pose a hazard.\n\nStep 2: Install the cable\n\nUse approved strain relief fittings to install the type UF cable. The cable must be able to withstand exposure to sunlight and moisture.\n\nStep 3: Backfill any open trenches or holes\n\nBefore switching on your electricity, ensure that you have backfilled any open trenches or holes.\n\nWhether you choose direct burial, PVC pipe buried under soil, or aerial method, following all local codes and working with a licensed electrician can prevent potential problems and ensure a successful installation of outdoor electrical wiring.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":125}
{"text":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological condition that affects one in every 59 children in the United States. As a parent of an autistic child, it is important to provide support and teach your child how to thrive in a world that can often be overwhelming. In this article, we will explore various ways to help your autistic child achieve their full potential.\n\nMaintain Consistency\n\nIt's important to keep a routine that your child can depend on. This includes consistent bedtimes, mealtimes, and activities. Changes in routine can be very upsetting for autistic children, so avoid making unnecessary changes in what they perceive as their domain. Try to keep the same caregivers, teachers, and pediatricians for as long as possible.\n\nUse Natural or Full Spectrum Lighting\n\nArtificial lighting can be triggering for autistic children. Natural or full spectrum lighting can help create a calming environment. Open blinds and curtains during the day to let in natural light. You can also consider investing in full spectrum light bulbs.\n\nConsider Noises in the Environment\n\nFor those on the autism spectrum, noises in the environment can be distracting or overwhelming. Use white noise or music to help block out background sounds. Avoid abrupt loud noises, such as slamming doors or honking car horns.\n\nLet Them Retreat to a Quiet Area\n\nWhen an autistic child becomes overwhelmed, it's important to let them retreat to a quiet area. This can include a designated space in the house, such as a bedroom or a sensory room. This quiet space should be free of distractions and offer a place for them to calm down.\n\nEnsure Safety Around Your Home\n\nSafety is important for all children, but especially for those on the autism spectrum. Ensure that your home is safe and secure by putting locks on cabinets and outlets, installing window guards, and having smoke detectors installed.\n\nUnderstand Stimming\n\nStimming is a self-stimulatory behavior that autistic children may engage in to cope with stress or sensory overload. Examples include hand-flapping, rocking, or repeating certain words or phrases. Recognize that stimming is a coping mechanism and not something that needs to be corrected.\n\nUnderstand the Importance of Special Interests\n\nSpecial interests are a common trait among those on the autism spectrum. These interests can bring your child joy, build self-esteem, and be a source of motivation. Encourage your child to pursue their interests and provide them with the resources to do so.\n\nExpect Different Body Language\n\nAutistic children may display different body language than neurotypical children. They may avoid eye contact, have difficulty understanding facial expressions, or have trouble with nonverbal cues. Learn to recognize their body language and communicate with them accordingly.\n\nKnow the Signs of Sensory Overload\n\nWhen sensory input becomes overwhelming for an autistic child, they may experience sensory overload. Signs of sensory overload include covering ears, avoiding touch, or becoming agitated. Learn to recognize these signs and provide your child with a safe and quiet space to calm down.\n\nCheck Up on the Child's Health with Their GP Regularly\n\nIt's important to check on your child's physical health with their GP regularly. Children on the autism spectrum are at an increased risk for certain medical conditions, such as seizures or gastrointestinal issues.\n\nSpeak to Your Child Often\n\nCommunication is key when raising an autistic child. Speak to your child often, even if they don't respond in the same way as a neurotypical child. Use simple language, visual aids, and repetition to help them understand.\n\nEncourage Communication, Verbal and Otherwise\n\nAutistic children may have difficulty with verbal communication. Encourage all forms of communication, including sign language, picture cards, and assistive technology. Give your child time to process and respond, and be patient with their communication style.\n\nMake it Clear That the Word \"No\" is Important\n\nIt's important to teach your child about boundaries and the importance of the word \"no.\" This can be especially difficult for autistic children who may struggle with social cues. Be clear and direct when setting boundaries and modeling appropriate behavior.\n\nExplain the Rules and the Behavior That You Expect\n\nAutistic children thrive on structure and routine. Explain the rules and the behavior that you expect from them in a clear and concise way. Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior.\n\nUnderstand the Use of Visual Stimuli\n\nVisual aids can be helpful for autistic children, who may struggle with verbal communication. Use visual aids such as picture cards, social stories, and schedules to help your child understand expectations and routines.\n\nFind Fun, Constructive Therapies That Help Your Child Grow\n\nTherapy can be a great way for autistic children to learn skills and build self-esteem. Find fun, constructive therapies such as music therapy, art therapy, or occupational therapy that can help your child grow and develop.\n\nRecognize That Autism is Lifelong\n\nAutism is a lifelong condition. As your child grows and develops, their needs will change. Stay informed and adaptable to their changing needs.\n\nQuit Measuring Yourself and Your Child Against Other Families\n\nEvery family is unique, and every child on the autism spectrum is different. Avoid comparing yourself or your child to others. Trust that you are doing the best you can for your child.\n\nTeach Your Child About Autism Early On\n\nTeaching your child about their autism can help them understand and cope with their condition. Use age-appropriate language and positive messaging to explain what autism is and how it affects them.\n\nHave the Attitude That You're in it for the Long Haul\n\nParenting an autistic child can be challenging, but it's important to have the attitude that you're in it for the long haul. Focus on your child's strengths, celebrate their successes, and remember that your love and support are the most important things you can give them.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":126}

{"text":"How to Protect Against an STD\n\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a serious health concern for anyone who is sexually active. Fortunately, there are many ways to protect yourself from contracting an STD. In this article, we will cover all of the most important steps you can take to safeguard your sexual health.\n\nMethod 1: Practice Safe Sex\n\n1. Consider abstinence. The only surefire way to completely eliminate your risk of contracting an STD is to abstain from sexual activity altogether.\n\n2. Consider monogamy. If you are going to have sex, limiting your partners can significantly reduce your risk of contracting an STD.\n\n3. Consider having very few sex partners. The more partners you have, the higher your risk of contracting an STD. Try to keep your sexual activity to a minimum.\n\n4. Have sex with tested partners. Ask your partner if they have been tested for STDs recently. If they have not, suggest that they get tested before engaging in sexual activity.\n\n5. Ask your sexual partners about their sexual health. It's important to have an open and honest conversation about sexual health with your partner. Ask about their past experiences and any current concerns they may have. Be sure to share your own information as well.\n\n6. Be fully aware during sexual activity. Don't engage in sexual activity if you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. You need to be fully alert and aware in order to practice safe sex.\n\n7. Avoid drugs. Drugs can impair judgment and lead to risky behavior. Avoid drug use when engaging in sexual activity.\n\n8. Establish safe sex rules with your partner. Make sure you and your partner have a clear understanding of what constitutes safe sex. This can include using protection, getting tested regularly, and avoiding risky sexual behaviors.\n\nMethod 2: Use Protection\n\n1. Do not have sex with a symptomatic partner. If your partner is showing signs of an STD, avoid engaging in sexual activity until they have been treated.\n\n2. Recognize that all forms of sex have STD risks. STDs can be transmitted during any type of sexual activity, including oral, anal, and vaginal sex.\n\n3. Recognize that forms of protection are not entirely foolproof. While using protection can significantly reduce your risk of contracting an STD, it is not 100% effective.\n\n4. Be aware of the difference between birth control and STD prevention. Birth control can prevent pregnancy, but it does not protect against STDs. Always use protection in addition to birth control.\n\n5. Buy latex condoms that say \"disease protection\" on the package. Look for condoms that are specifically designed to protect against STDs.\n\n6. Use condoms correctly and consistently. Make sure you know how to use a condom properly. Use a new condom every time you engage in sexual activity.\n\n7. Only use one condom at a time. Using multiple condoms can actually increase your risk of breakage and reduce their effectiveness.\n\n8. Make sure condoms haven't expired. Check the expiration date on your condoms before using them.\n\n9. Don't store condoms in hot or sunny places. Exposure to heat and sunlight can weaken latex condoms.\n\n10. Use dental dams. Dental dams are thin sheets of latex that can be used to protect against STDs during oral sex.\n\n11. Use medical gloves. Medical gloves can be used to protect your hands during sexual activity.\n\n12. Use protection on any sexual devices. If you use sex toys or other devices during sexual activity, make sure they are properly cleaned and protected with a condom.\n\n13. Do not use oil-based lubricant on latex products. Oil-based lubricants can weaken latex condoms and increase the risk of breakage.\n\nMethod 3: Get Vaccinated\n\n1. Get vaccinated. Vaccines are available to protect against certain STDs, such as HPV and hepatitis B.\n\n2. Get circumcised. Circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of contracting STDs, including HIV.\n\n3. Take Truvada if you are at high risk of contracting HIV. Truvada is a medication that can reduce your risk of contracting HIV if taken consistently.\n\nMethod 4: Get Tested\n\n1. Avoid douching. Douching can disrupt the natural balance of bacteria in the vagina and increase your risk of contracting an STD.\n\n2. Recognize common STD symptoms. Know what to look for and seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms of an STD.\n\n3. Recognize that many STDs are treatable. Don't be afraid to seek treatment if you think you may have an STD.\n\n4. Determine whether you are in a high-risk group. Certain populations, such as men who have sex with men and people who use drugs, are at a higher risk of contracting STDs.\n\n5. Get tested frequently. Testing can help you detect STDs early and prevent the spread of infection.\n\n6. Provide blood, urine, and fluid samples. Your healthcare provider may need to collect samples in order to test for STDs.\n\n7. Get your partner tested. Encourage your partner to get tested for STDs as well.\n\n8. Find free services if you need them. Many organizations offer free STD testing and treatment services.\n\nMethod 5: Be Open and Honest\n\n1. Do not be ashamed. STDs are a common health concern, and there is no reason to be ashamed if you contract an STD.\n\n2. Recognize that not all STDs can be tested for. Some STDs may not show up on a test immediately.\n\n3. Follow your doctor's instructions. If you are diagnosed with an STD, be sure to follow your doctor's instructions for treatment.\n\n4. Notify all sexual partners of a diagnosis. It's important to notify all sexual partners if you are diagnosed with an STD so they can get tested and treated as well.\n\nBy following these steps, you can significantly reduce your risk of contracting an STD. Remember to practice safe sex, use protection, get vaccinated, get tested, and be open and honest about your sexual health.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":129}

{"text":"Have you ever anticipated your birthday, knowing there will be a present waiting for you, but you can't find it? It can be frustrating to look around aimlessly and fail to locate it. However, with a little bit of creativity, you can search for your present without being detected. Read on to find out how to find where your parents hid your birthday present.\n\nMethod 1: Create a List of What You Want A Month Before Your Birthday\n\nCreating a list of what you want as a birthday present will give you an idea of what to search for. If you have certain items you would like, write them down in a list a month before your birthday. This way, you will narrow down your search, making it less overwhelming.\n\nMethod 2: Pick One Thing on the List\n\nTo make your search process easier, pick one item on the list you made and focus on finding it. This will prevent you from trying to look for too many things at once, which can be stressful.\n\nMethod 3: Try to Look for Your Presents Secretly When You're Alone or When You Know You Won't Be Caught\n\nIt's best to search for your present when you're alone in the house or when your parents aren't around. This will give you plenty of time to search without any distractions or interruptions. Make sure you don't leave any clues behind that you have been searching.\n\nMethod 4: Look in a Closet or Other Space That is Always Locked\n\nIf your parents keep valuable items locked in a closet or other space, it's possible they might have hidden your present there too. Check to see if there's any additional lock or key that could be used to access the closet.\n\nMethod 5: Think Outside the Box\n\nYour parents might have hidden your present somewhere unexpected. Try to look in unusual places such as under a piece of furniture, behind curtains, or inside objects you wouldn't expect it to be in.\n\nMethod 6: Think to Yourself, \"Where Would I Hide It?\"\n\nIf you were in your parents' position, where would you hide their present? Put yourself in their shoes and try to think of creative hiding spots.\n\nMethod 7: Check Her Email\n\nSometimes, parents might email receipts or purchase confirmations to themselves, providing an opportunity for you to snoop around. Just be careful not to jump to conclusions or ruin the surprise for yourself.\n\nMethod 8: Look in the Trunk of the Car That You Don't Use\n\nIf your parents have a car that they hardly use or mention, they might have hidden your present in the trunk. Ask if you can put something in the trunk, and if they say yes, take a quick peek to see if anything is inside.\n\nMethod 9: Be Prepared for the Right Time to Look Around\n\nLooking for your present requires patience, timing, and planning. Wait for the right moment before you start searching, such as when your parents are out of the house, or when they are asleep. This way, you won't be interrupted in the middle of your search.\n\nMethod 10: Ask Your Parent\/Guardian Where You Could Hide a Present for Someone\n\nYour parents might tell you their secrets if they think it's a simple question. Ask them where they would hide a present for someone to get an idea of where they may have hidden your present.\n\nMethod 11: Your Parents Might Drop Hints as if to Tell You What They Got\n\nParents sometimes can't contain their excitement and might drop hints on what they got you for your birthday. Get a pen and paper and write down the hints you get. This might help you narrow your search down further.\n\nMethod 12: If Your Parents Take You to Their Workplace, Look Around There Because They Might Be Hiding It in Their Office\n\nSometimes, parents might have their offices in their workplace, and they could have hidden your present in there. If they have already taken you to their workplace, then use the opportunity to scope out the place for any signs of your present.\n\nMethod 13: Try to Look Through Receipts That are Used and See if Anything Might Possibly be for You\n\nIf your parents leave receipts lying around, take a quick look to see if any of them could be for your present. They might have accidentally left it behind.\n\nMethod 14: Your Parents Might Not Have Bought it Yet, So Look Around\n\nIt's possible your parents may not have bought your present yet. If this is the case, don't stress out too much about looking for it, as it won't be there.\n\nMethod 15: If You Can't Find Any Evidence, Then They Probably Haven't Bought Anything Yet.\n\nIf you have tried all the above methods and still can't find your present, then your parents likely haven't purchased it yet. Don't beat yourself up about it; sometimes, patience is key!\n\nIn conclusion, finding your birthday present requires creativity and a bit of detective work. Prepare a list of what you want, focus on searching for one item, and think outside the box. Keep in mind; your parents have probably hidden your present so well that finding it requires some time and effort. With patience and persistence, you eventually find it.

{"text":"Psychology journal articles can be overwhelming to read, with technical details and jargon that may be difficult to understand. However, with a little bit of guidance and understanding of the structure, reading psychology journal articles can be a much smoother process. In this article, we will guide you through the basic steps of reading psychology journal articles.\n\n1.

Look to the Introduction for the \"why\": \n\nThe introduction is usually the first part where the researchers explain the theoretical background of the research matter. It sets the stage for the study by describing the problem area and previous research on the topic. By reading the introduction, you can understand why the study was conducted and what the researchers hoped to accomplish.\n\n4. Read the Method for the \"how\": \n\nYou can see the introduction as the \u201cwhy\u201d and the method as the \u201chow\u201d of a study. The method part includes all technical details of the study, such as inclusions and exclusions criteria, sampling techniques, experimental design, and statistical analysis. Reading the method section will help you understand how the researchers conducted the study.\n\n5. Look to the Results for the outcomes: \n\nIn the results part, the researchers explain what was done with the data including the outcome of the analysis. The results section presents the findings of the study in detail. When reading this section, it is important to focus on the main points and understand what the data is showing.\n\n6. Get an overview of the results and limitations in the Discussion: \n\nIn the discussion, you will mostly find a summary of the research purpose, an overview of the main results, strengths, and limitations of the study due to sample, methods used, interpretation validity, practical implications and opportunities for prospective research attempts. This section is a critical part of the article because it enables the authors to interpret their findings and place them in a broader context.\n\n7. Check the References for citations: \n\nThe references show all other studies that were used in the paper in alphabetic order. By checking the references, you can identify other studies that may be relevant to your research. They also help you evaluate the credibility of the study by assessing the quality of the sources cited.\n\n8. Read the abstract again: \n\nSince the abstract is a summary by itself, you will get straight to the point information from this brief paragraph. Rereading the abstract after reading the article can help you solidify your understanding of the study and its findings.\n\n9.

{"text":"How to Deal with Condescending People\n\nDealing with condescending people can be challenging and frustrating. Whether it is a coworker, boss, friend, or family member, it is important to know how to handle this behavior in a constructive way. In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to deal with condescending people.\n\n1. Recognize condescending behavior when you see it\n\nThe first step in dealing with condescending people is to recognize the behavior. Condescending behavior can take many forms, from subtle put-downs to outright insults. Some common examples include:\n\n- Talking down to you\n- Making patronizing or sarcastic remarks\n- Interrupting or ignoring you\n- Dismissing your opinions or ideas\n- Belittling your accomplishments\n\n2. Ignore it and move on\n\nIf a person makes a condescending comment without it being part of a pattern of behavior, the most efficient and effective thing to do may be to just move on. Dwelling on it and engaging in a back-and-forth argument can escalate the situation and lead to unnecessary tension. Instead, just let it go and focus on the task at hand.\n\n3. Turn the condescension into action\n\nSometimes, the best way to deal with condescension is to turn it into action. For example, if a coworker is constantly belittling your ideas, use that as motivation to work harder and prove them wrong. Use their condescension to fuel your determination and drive.\n\n4. Get support\n\nIf you are dealing with a chronically condescending coworker, talk to a supervisor about the behavior problem. Explain how it is affecting your work and ask for advice on how to handle the situation.\n\n5. Seek face-to-face discussion\n\nTo deal with a condescending coworker or supervisor most efficiently and effectively, ask to set up a personal meeting to discuss the issue. This will allow both parties to express their concerns and grievances in a constructive manner. Be sure to remain calm, professional, and respectful throughout the discussion.\n\n6. Speak up\n\nIf someone's condescension is interfering with your ability to do your job, then you need to call the person out. Don't be afraid to speak up and assert yourself. Let the person know that their behavior is unacceptable and that you will not tolerate it.\n\n7. Don\u2019t lash out\n\nWhile it may be tempting to lash out at a condescending person, doing so can only make the situation worse. Avoid getting defensive or confrontational. Instead, remain calm and assertive.\n\n8. Avoid judgmental body language\n\nNon-verbal communication is always important, especially when trying to work through conflicts. Be aware of your body language and avoid judgmental gestures such as eye rolling, crossing your arms, or frowning. Instead, maintain an open and relaxed posture.\n\n9. Try to see things through the other person\u2019s perspective\n\nSometimes, people are condescending without even realizing it. Try to see things from their perspective and understand where they are coming from. Perhaps they are feeling insecure or threatened in some way.\n\n10. Give a corrective review\n\nAfter your meeting, you can ask your supervisor to issue a report that offers suggestions for how to deal with and avoid condescending behavior. This can help prevent the behavior from happening in the future and provide a constructive way forward.\n\nIn conclusion, dealing with condescending people can be challenging, but it is important to stay calm and assertive. By recognizing the behavior, seeking support, and speaking up when necessary, you can assert yourself and maintain your dignity and self-respect.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":135}
{"text":"Have some money and a desire to build an electric guitar? Follow these steps to create your own custom instrument.\n\n1. Make sure you REALLY want to do this. Making a guitar can take a while and will waste your good money if you decide to quit halfway through.\n\n2. Look through guitar magazines and on the internet for inspiration for a design. Once you have a design, make a scale drawing of it on graph paper or on a vector drawing program like CorelDraw.\n\n3. Get access to power tools.\n\n4. Get some nice pieces of wood for the body (alder and ash are most commonly used for their sound - ash is heavier but is less expensive and alder is a lot nicer because it is lighter but probably a bit harder to find and a little more expensive), the neck (any type of maple is good for this), and the fretboard (ebony and rosewood are the two most common woods).\n\n5. Trace your design onto the wood for the body, include the outline and anywhere else where there will be holes or cavities for the electronics.\n\n6. Cut out the body with your jigsaw or band saw (or hand saw).\n\n7. Hollow out the cavities for the electronics and pickups, and the area where the neck sits, and drill holes for the neck to be bolted on to.\n\n8. Sand down the body, round out sharp edges, and finish the body as desired.\n\n9. Get the wood you want to use for the neck, make some rough cuts to get a basic shape, and cut out the area where the truss rod goes.\n\n10. Get a truss rod at a guitar store, repair shop, or online. Alternatively, you can go to a hardware store and buy a threaded rod.\n\n11. Glue the fretboard on using wood glue.\n\n12. Radius the fretboard using a radius sanding block.\n\n13. Get fret wire, pre-bend it to the approximate radius and hammer it in.\n\n14. Make final cuts to your neck, drill holes for the tuners and neck bolts, and sand it to its final shape.\n\n15. Get a pickguard, bridge, nut, tuners, knobs, and electronics.\n\n16. Assemble your guitar to see how it looks, then disassemble it.\n\n17. Spray paint and prime the body. Let it completely dry for a couple of weeks.\n\n18. Assemble the electronics (you'll need a soldering iron and know how to use it).\n\n19. String up your guitar, plug it in, and rock out!\n\nRemember, building a guitar takes time and effort, but the satisfaction of playing your own custom instrument can be incredibly rewarding.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":136}
{"text":"Traveling can be exciting, but it also means you'll have to do laundry on the road. Whether you're backpacking through Europe, on a business trip, or simply visiting family, there are a few tips you can use to make the laundry process easier and more convenient. In this article, you'll learn how to do laundry while traveling with our step-by-step guide.\n\nPlan Ahead\n\nBefore embarking on your trip, make sure to research your destination and accommodations. Some hotels and Airbnbs offer laundry services, so you won't have to worry about doing your own laundry. However, if that isn't an option, you'll need to plan ahead and bring your own laundry supplies.\n\nBring Laundry Supplies\n\nPack a small bag of laundry supplies, including laundry detergent, stain remover, and a sink stopper (plug). You may also want to bring clothes pins to hang your clothes to dry. Look for small, travel-sized containers to save space in your bags.\n\nMany US Hotels Have Their Own Self-Service Laundries\n\nIf you're staying in a hotel, check to see if they have their own laundry facility. Many hotels in the United States offer self-service laundries, which can save you time and money.\n\nKeep Alternatives in Mind\n\nIf you're unable to find a hotel with a self-service laundry, look for nearby laundromats or dry cleaners. Some hostels may also have laundry facilities available to guests.\n\nWatch Your Timing\n\nWhen doing laundry on the road, timing is important. Plan your laundry day for a time when you'll have access to the laundry facilities or when you won't need your clothes for a day or so.\n\nShower First\n\nBefore doing laundry, take a shower or bath. This will help remove any excess dirt or sweat from your clothes, making them easier to clean. Plus, this way you won't have to worry about getting your clothes wet before washing them.\n\nPlan Where You Will Hang the Laundry Before You Get Anything Wet\n\nOnce you have your laundry supplies ready, plan where you'll hang your clothes to dry. If you're staying in a hotel or Airbnb, look for a balcony or outdoor area where you can hang clothes. If that isn't an option, try to find a well-ventilated area in your room.\n\nPlace the Sink Stopper (Plug) in the Drain\n\nFill the sink with cool or warm water and add laundry soap, shampoo, or detergent.\n\nWash the Clothes by Moving Them Around in the Soapy Water\n\nGently rub the fabric against itself to help the soap do its job. Continue to move the clothes around in the soapy water for a few minutes.\n\nDrain the Soapy Water Out of the Sink and Squeeze the Laundry Gently to Get Most of the Soap Out\n\nRefill the sink with clean water to rinse the laundry. Drain the sink again and let the laundry drip out for a few moments.\n\nSqueeze Out Excess Water With Your Hands\n\nLay the damp garments in a single layer on a bath towel. Roll the towel around them and squeeze to remove most of the excess water, or put the rolled towel on the floor and walk back and forth on it.\n\nHang the Clothes to Dry\n\nGently hang the clothes on a clothesline, hanger, or other suitable surface. Hang the towel to dry as well.\n\nDry Garments the Rest of the Way\n\nAllow your clothes to dry completely before packing them away again. This may take a few hours or even a full day, depending on the humidity and temperature in your location.\n\nIn summary, laundry doesn't have to be a hassle when you're traveling. With a little planning and the right supplies, you can have clean clothes in no time. Keep these tips in mind and you'll be a laundry pro in no time.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":137}
{"text":"Hookworms are parasites that can infect humans who live in high-risk areas or lack proper hygiene practices. These worms can cause anemia, skin rashes, coughing, and other symptoms if left untreated. Here's how to get rid of hookworms when infected:\n\n1. Consider your exposure to high-risk areas. Hookworms are most commonly found in warm and humid climates where sanitation is poor, such as parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. If you live in or have traveled to these areas, you may be at risk.\n\n2. Think about how you could have contracted hookworm. The parasites can enter the body through the skin, mouth, or nose. They may be present in contaminated soil, feces, or water.\n\n3. Watch for a \"serpiginous rash.\" This is a red, raised rash that appears on the skin where the hookworm larvae have burrowed in. It may be itchy and painful.\n\n4. Look for mild coughing or sore throat. Once you've contracted hookworm, they find their way into your bloodstream and can cause respiratory symptoms.\n\n5. Notice signs of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Hookworms feed on blood and can cause significant blood loss over time.\n\n6. Do not ignore stomach pain. Hookworms migrate to the intestines, so gastrointestinal discomfort is not uncommon, especially following eating.\n\n7. Note that many patients do not exhibit symptoms. However, if you suspect you have been infected with hookworm, seek medical attention promptly.\n\n8. Seek early diagnosis. If you live in a high-risk area, ask the doctor to make hookworm testing part of your regular checkup. The earlier the infection is detected, the easier it is to treat.\n\n9. Follow the anthelmintic drug schedule your doctor prescribes. Anthelmintic drugs attack intestinal parasites like hookworms and may need to be repeated over several weeks.\n\n10. Refrain from scratching itchy rashes under any circumstance. Scratching can cause skin damage and allow bacteria to enter.\n\n11. Protect your hands from fecal matter. When using the restroom, keep your hands away from your rectum, and wash them thoroughly afterward.\n\n12. Complete iron therapy if necessary. Because hookworms cause blood loss, an infection often results in iron-deficient anemia. Iron supplements may be necessary to restore healthy levels.\n\n13. Revisit the doctor as directed. The appointment schedule may vary depending on the doctor's evaluation of your particular case.\n\n14. Wash your hands thoroughly. This should be done regularly, especially before handling food.\n\n15. Always wear shoes outdoors. This is especially important if you are in a high-risk location, as hookworm larvae can penetrate the skin of bare feet.\n\n16. Have the veterinarian check and deworm cats and dogs annually. Even if your pet was dewormed when you adopted it from the shelter, it can come into contact with hookworms at a later time.\n\n17. Never let your pet lick you on the mouth. Dogs especially love to show their love by licking their human on the face, including the mouth. Avoid this to prevent infection.\n\n18. Take care when handling pet feces. Wear gloves and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.\n\n19. Monitor children closely. Even for adults, containing a hookworm infection can be hard. For children, it's essential to prevent them from putting contaminated objects in their mouth and teach them proper hygiene.\n\n20. Make sure your water and food are clean and sterile. Avoid drinking untreated water and wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating. By following these tips, you can reduce the risk of hookworm infection and prevent its spread.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":138}

This includes washing hands before and after handling food, using clean utensils and surfaces, and properly cooking food to prevent foodborne illnesses.\n\nStep 7: Talk about how to measure and why you are measuring (pre-math).\n\nTeaching pre-math concepts, such as measuring, is an important part of early literacy skills. Explain to the children why we measure ingredients and what units we use. Allow them to help with measuring and count as you go along.\n\nStep 8: Ask open-ended questions of the children, such as what will happen when we put this in the oven?\n\nAsking open-ended questions encourages children to think critically and allows for discussion about what is happening during the activity.\n\nStep 9: Be sure each child gets a chance to \"help\" in the activity.\n\nGiving each child a chance to participate and help in the activity promotes team building and allows for hands-on learning.\n\nStep 10: If you have a large group of children, more than three or four, plan to do the activity more than once, dividing the children into groups.\n\nDividing the children into smaller groups ensures that each child has a chance to participate and be involved in the activity.\n\nStep 11: Let the children help with the clean-up, too.\n\nCleaning up after the activity teaches children about responsibility and teamwork. Allow them to help clean up the utensils and surfaces.\n\nStep 12: Even though preschool children cannot yet tell time, setting a timer and asking them to watch the time with you helps them to begin to develop a sense of time.\n\nIntroducing time management skills at an early age can be very helpful for children as they grow older.\n\nStep 13: Point out that you must complete the steps in a recipe in a certain order to get the desired end product.\n\nTeaching sequencing skills helps children to understand that certain steps must be followed in order to achieve a desired outcome.\n\nStep 14: When the recipe is complete, enjoy the food with the children and congratulate them on their creation.\n\nEnjoying the food together allows for a sense of accomplishment and pride in their creation.\n\nStep 15: You may want to read the story again as the children enjoy the food.\n\nRe-reading the story can reinforce the connection between literature and the cooking activity and allow for further discussion.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":143}

{"text":"A crown knot is a popular knot used in various applications such as climbing, sailing, or for decorative purposes. It is a knot that is not only practical but also visually appealing. Creating a crown knot may seem intimidating at first, but with a little patience and practice, you can easily master it. In this article, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of making a crown knot.\n\nPart 1: Creating the Basic Crown Knot\n\n1. Place the working end of the rope to be crowned in your left hand, unwinding about 4\" (10cm) of it.\n2. Place your thumb on the front of the rope and your fingers on the rear.\n3. Arrange the strands so that the two of them come across the top of the rope in a diagonal direction (lower left to upper right).\n4. With your right hand, take the uppermost of the front strands (which will be strand 1) and bend it over to the right forming a bight.\n5. With your right hand, take strand 2, the remaining strand of the two that originally came across the \"top\" of the rope, and bend it around the bight in strand 1 that you are holding in your left.\n6. After making this wrap, place the end of strand 2 between the standing end of the bight in strand 1 and 3.\n7. Secure the end of strand 2 between the forefinger and thumb of your left hand and the rope.\n8. With your right hand, take the end of strand 3 and place it under the bight in strand 1 and over all parts of strand 2.\n9. Release your grasp on the strand ends.\n10. Hold the end of the rope with the crown knot in your left hand.\n\nPart 2: Backsplicing the Crown Knot\n\n1. Select a strand, call it strand 1 (even if it's strand 2, 3, or 1), sticking out from under the crown knot and begin the backsplicing at that point by placing your right thumb partially under it and at the same time upon the strand it is passing over or lying upon.\n2. With your left forefinger and thumb, grasp the strand immediately below the one your right thumb is holding.\n3. With your right hand, twist the crown clockwise while twisting the standing end of the rope counterclockwise with your left.\n4. Keep this strand isolated, and with your right hand, place the end of strand 1 under it and pull it through until it's pulling against the crown itself.\n5. Retighten the crown by holding it in your left hand and pulling each crowned strand downward with a clockwise twist.\n6. Move to the next strand to be spliced back into the parent rope by twisting the rope around 1\/3 turn in either direction until the next strand coming out from under the crown knot is reached.\n7. As with the first over and under, place your right thumb under strand 2 and upon the strand it's passing over.\n8. Study the crowning at this point.\n9. Keep this strand isolated, and with your right hand place the end of strand 2 under it and pull it through until it is pulling against the crown knot.\n10. Retighten the crown as before by pulling each crowned strand in a clockwise downward twist.\n11. There is only one strand, being strand 3, remaining, and it too must go through the over-and-under process.\n12. Grasp the knot in your right hand exactly as you did before for the first and second strands.\n13. Retighten the crowning as before by pulling each strand in a clockwise downward twist.\n14. To continue the crowning or backsplicing, repeat the preceding steps for as many rounds of splice as desired.\n15. Finish the crowning or backsplicing with a final retighten and rolling of the entire crown between the palms of your hands.\n16. Finished.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily create a crown knot in no time. Whether you want to use it for practical applications or decorative purposes, this knot is sure to come in handy. With a bit of practice, you will become a master of the crown knot.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":145}

{"text":"Spline dovetail joints are a beautiful and functional way to join two pieces of wood together, and they can add an extra touch of elegance to any woodworking project. With the right tools and techniques, making spline dovetail joints is easier than you might think! Follow these steps to learn how to make spline dovetail joints.\n\nPart 1: Making the Jig\n\n1. Gather your materials. To make a spline dovetail joint, you'll need a few tools and materials:\n\n- A router with a dovetail cutter\n- A table saw\n- A piece of scrap wood for the jig\n- Clamps\n- Setting bar\n- Pencil\n\n2. Cut the scrap wood to the size of your workpiece. Cut a piece of 3\/4\" plywood or MDF to the same length and width as your workpiece. The jig should be at least 2\" wide.\n\n3. Draw your lines. Draw a series of evenly spaced dovetail lines on your workpiece. The number of lines will determine the number of splines needed.\n\n4. Make the setting bar. Cut a piece of scrap wood to the same length as your jig, and drill a hole in the center.\n\n5. Mount the jig. Clamp the jig to your benchtop. Make sure it is level and square.\n\nPart 2: Machining the Joint\n\n1. Secure the assembled mitre joint. Clamp your assembled mitre joint in the bench vice so it faces upwards.\n\n2. Mark the dovetail spacings. Use your pencil to mark out the dovetail spacings across the joint.\n\n3. Use the setting bar. Insert the setting bar through the jig and line it up on the first of the marked lines on the joint below.\n\n4. Secure the jig. Clamp the jig in place so it fits squarely over the mitred workpiece.\n\n5. Plunge the cutter. Stand the router on the jig and plunge the cutter until it touches the joint.\n\n6. Run the machine. Start the machine and run it through the joint.\n\n7. Repeat the process. Repeat the process for each of the marked lines on the joint.\n\n8. Remove the cutter. After machining, remove the dovetail cutter from the router.\n\nPart 3: Adding the Splines\n\n1. Transfer the angle setting. Use your setting bar to transfer this angle setting to your table saw.\n\n2. Set the rip fence. Set the rip fence a little wider than the base of the dovetail, and rip down both sides of your timber to make the splines.\n\n3. Adjust the fit. Adjust the fit of the splines into the joints until they slide in smoothly.\n\n4. Cut the splines. Cut the splines into short lengths.\n\n5. Repeat the process. Repeat the process for the other sockets.\n\n6. Trim off the waste. Trim off the waste with a flexible pull saw.\n\n7. Clean up the joint. Finally, clean up the surface of the joint with fine abrasive paper.\n\nYou're finished! You should now have a beautiful spline dovetail joint with the dark splines contrasting well with the paler wood of the workpiece.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":147}

{"text":"How to Decide to Take Testosterone\n\nTestosterone is a hormone that is often associated with masculinity, and is produced in both men and women. In some cases, individuals may require supplemental testosterone therapy in order to achieve optimal hormonal balance. If you are considering testosterone therapy, it is important to make an informed decision by consulting with a doctor, researching potential side effects, and monitoring any changes that may result from the treatment.\n\n1. Make a list of questions and concerns about testosterone before visiting the doctor.\n\nAs with any other health condition or prescription drug, it is important to be informed before talking with your doctor so as to avoid confusion or misunderstanding. Some questions to consider may include: What are the long-term effects of testosterone therapy? What are some common side effects? Are there any precautions I should take before starting testosterone therapy? Your doctor will be able to address these and other questions you may have during your appointment.\n\n2. Consult a doctor about whether you need to take testosterone.\n\nYour doctor can run tests to help you determine if supplemental testosterone would help you. In men, low testosterone is diagnosed by a full-body examination that helps rule out alternatives to low testosterone levels like pituitary tumors or thyroid problems. A blood test may also be performed to determine your testosterone levels. Similarly, for women, a blood test for testosterone is the most commonly used test to determine levels.\n\n3. Don\u2019t assume you need testosterone just because your levels are lower than average.\n\nNormal testosterone levels can vary from person to person, and there is in fact no absolute definition of low testosterone. It is important to consider your individual symptoms and medical history before deciding to start testosterone therapy.\n\n4. Stay aware of cardiovascular problems.\n\nTestosterone has the potential to negatively impact your cardiovascular health. Before starting testosterone therapy, it is important to discuss any existing heart problems with your doctor. Your doctor may recommend certain precautions or lifestyle changes to mitigate these risks.\n\n5. Look for other side effects.\n\nTestosterone therapy can cause a variety of side effects, including acne, hair loss, mood swings, and sleep apnea. Some side effects may be mild and go away on their own, while others may require medical attention. It is important to discuss any potential risks and side effects with your doctor before starting testosterone therapy.\n\n6. Monitor your mental, physical, and sexual health for changes and side effects.\n\nTestosterone therapy can cause significant changes in your mental, physical, and sexual health, and it is important that you keep track of these changes and any side effects so that you can discuss them with your doctor during your next visit. Some potential changes may include increased aggression, decreased libido, increased muscle mass, and increased risk of prostate cancer.\n\nIn conclusion, deciding to take testosterone therapy should not be taken lightly. Consulting with your doctor, researching potential side effects, and monitoring any changes that result from the treatment are all important steps in making an informed decision. By staying informed, you can make the best decision for your individual health needs and goals.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":154}
{"text":"Removing wallpaper can be a tedious task, especially if you're dealing with a stubborn one that refuses to budge. However, with the right tools and techniques, you can get the job done in no time. In this article, we will guide you through the steps needed to remove stubborn wallpaper.\n\nPart 1: Preparation\n\n1. Survey the type of wallpaper you need to remove.\nBefore you start the removal process, it's essential to know what kind of wallpaper you're dealing with. There are different types of wallpaper, and some may require different removal techniques.\n\n2. Lay drop cloths around your floor.\nProtect your floor from drips and spills by laying down drop cloths or plastic sheets.\n\n3. Remove trim and\/or outlet covers.\nIt's best to remove any trim and outlet covers before starting the removal process.\n\n4. Remove electronic devices.\nUnplug and remove any electronic devices from the wall to prevent damage.\n\n5. Put on your work clothes and rubber gloves.\nIt's essential to protect your clothing and skin from the wallpaper adhesive and chemicals you'll be using during the removal process.\n\nPart 2: Removing the Wallpaper\n\n1. Look for an edge where the wallpaper is peeling.\nStart by looking for an edge where the wallpaper is peeling. If you find one, gently pull it back to see if the rest of the wallpaper will come off effortlessly.\n\n2. Use a wallpaper-scouring tool to puncture the wallpaper.\nIf you don't find a peeling edge, use a wallpaper-scouring tool to puncture the wallpaper. This tool will help the solution penetrate the wallpaper and loosen the adhesive.\n\n3. Mix a solution of one part hot water with one part fabric softener.\nIn a spray bottle, mix one part hot water with one part fabric softener. Fabric softener helps to dissolve the glue holding the wallpaper to the wall.\n\n4. Work on a small area of the wallpaper at once so that the solution doesn't start to dry.\nSpray a small area of the wallpaper with the solution and work on it immediately. This will prevent the solution from drying up before it has time to work on the adhesive.\n\n5. Let the solution sit on the paper for five to 10 minutes.\nLet the solution sit on the paper for five to 10 minutes before attempting to remove the wallpaper.\n\n6. Pull from bottom to top, loosening edges with a paper scraper.\nStart pulling the wallpaper from the bottom to the top. Use a paper scraper to help you loosen the edges of the wallpaper.\n\n7. Purchase or rent a wallpaper steamer.\nIf the solution method is not working, consider renting or purchasing a wallpaper steamer. A wallpaper steamer uses steam to loosen up the adhesive.\n\n8. Steam a small area of the wall.\nSteam a small area of the wall to soften the adhesive. Once the wallpaper is soft enough, use a scraper to remove it.\n\n9. Opt to replace your water-based stripper with a gel-based stripper.\nIf the water-based stripper is not working, consider using a gel-based stripper instead. Gel-based strippers have stronger chemicals that can help remove stubborn wallpaper.\n\n10. Consider that the person who installed the wallpaper did not use traditional wallpaper paste.\nIf you're dealing with an unconventional wallpaper paste, like glue or caulk, you may need to resort to sanding or chiseling to remove it.\n\n11. Fill a bucket with hot water.\nIf you're still struggling to remove the wallpaper, fill a bucket with hot water.\n\n12. Soak a washcloth in the hot water.\nSoak a washcloth in the hot water and place it over the stubborn area. Let it sit for a few minutes.\n\n13. Remove it before it cools.\nRemove the washcloth before it cools, as this can cause the wallpaper adhesive to harden again.\n\n14. Rinse the scouring pad.\nAfter each use, rinse your scouring pad to keep it clean.\n\nRemoving stubborn wallpaper can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, but with patience and the right tools, you can get it done. The key is to find a method that works best for your specific wallpaper type and adhesive. Now that you know how to remove stubborn wallpaper, you're ready to update your walls with a fresh coat of paint or new wallpaper.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":155}

{"text":"Teaching participial phrases can be a challenging topic for some students. However, with the right approach and strategies, you can make it an engaging and memorable lesson. In this article, we will discuss some effective ways to teach participial phrases to your students.\n\nStep 1: Explain What a Participle Is\n\nStart by explaining that a participle is a form of a verb. Most often, it ends in \u201cing\u201d or \u201ced.\u201d However, there are exceptions that you can cover later on. Use common examples such as \u201crunning\u201d or \u201ccooked\u201d to help students identify participles in sentences.\n\nStep 2: Discuss the Use of Participles\n\nExplain how a participle can be used to modify a noun or pronoun in a sentence. For example, in the sentence \u201cThe girl walking down the street is my friend,\u201d the participle \u201cwalking\u201d modifies the noun \u201cgirl.\u201d This adds more detail to the sentence.\n\nStep 3: Demonstrate a Participial Phrase\n\nUse a more complicated example to show how a participle can be used with other words to form a participial phrase. For instance, \u201cExcited about her upcoming trip to Paris, Sophia packed her bags.\u201d Here, the participial phrase \u201cExcited about her upcoming trip to Paris\u201d modifies the subject \u201cSophia\u201d and provides more context and detail about her actions.\n\nStep 4: Differentiate Present and Past Participles\n\nExplain the difference between present and past participles. Present participles describe something that is happening currently, such as \u201cThe boy is running to the store.\u201d In contrast, past participles describe something that happened in the past, like \u201cThe cake was baked by the chef.\u201d\n\nStep 5: Introduce \u201ced\u201d Participles\n\nIntroduce students to verbs that end in \u201ced\u201d as participles. For example, \u201cThe bored student yawned in class\u201d or \u201cThe broken vase was glued back together.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Explain the Advantages of Using Participial Phrases\n\nAsk the students why they would use participial phrases instead of writing a longer sentence. If they are struggling with the concept, explain how these phrases can be used to describe something in fewer words and to vary sentence structure.\n\nStep 7: Practice Exercises\n\nTry some examples written on the board or on a sheet, and discuss how to identify participles and participial phrases. Give the students a worksheet filled with participial phrases, and ask them to identify the phrases and the words they modify. Lastly, have the students write their own sentences using participial phrases.\n\nStep 8: Consistent Practice\n\nPractice recognizing and using these phrases frequently throughout the unit and year. You can review participial phrases in future lessons and even make it a game to reinforce this grammar concept.\n\nIn conclusion, teaching participial phrases takes time and effort, but with these steps, you can make it easier and more enjoyable for your students. When they grasp this grammar concept, their writing skills will greatly improve, and they'll be able to create more dynamic sentences.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":163}

{"text":"A portable bandsaw is a must-have for anyone who works with wood or metal. It allows for clean, precise cuts that are much harder to achieve with other tools. Whether you are a professional carpenter or a DIY enthusiast, a portable bandsaw is an essential addition to your toolkit.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best portable bandsaw for your needs, you have two options - renting or buying. If you only need to use the tool for a short period of time, renting might be the more cost-effective option. However, if you need to use the tool regularly, buying it will save you money in the long run.\n\nOnce you have your portable bandsaw, it's important to familiarize yourself with the tool. This will help you use it safely and effectively. Start by reading the operator's manual and becoming familiar with the unique characteristics of your saw. Pay special attention to the safety recommendations from the manufacturer.\n\nWhen using a portable bandsaw, it's essential to dress appropriately. Wear close-fitting clothing and avoid loose jewelry or anything that could get caught in the saw. Safety glasses are also a must.\n\nBefore making any cuts, make sure you are properly supporting the material you're cutting.

{"text":"Kidney function is vital to maintaining overall health and wellness. The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood and regulating blood pressure. If you suspect that your kidney function may be compromised, there are several tests that your physician can perform to evaluate your kidneys. In this article, we will discuss how to test kidney function.\n\n1. See your physician for a urine \"ACR\" to test your kidney function.\n\nThe urine \"ACR\" stands for the \"albumin to creatinine ratio.\" This test measures the amount of protein in your urine. High levels of protein in the urine can be a sign of kidney damage. Your physician may ask you to collect a urine sample at home or at their office. They will send the sample to a laboratory for analysis.\n\n2. Understand that you may receive a \"random\" urine test or a 24-hour test.\n\nIf you and your doctor opt for a \"random\" sample, you will be asked to submit a one-time urine sample to the lab which can give a snapshot view as to the amount of protein present in your urine at that time. However, if your physician suspects a more chronic or serious issue, they may order a 24-hour urine collection. This test is more comprehensive and can provide a more accurate picture of your kidney function.\n\n3. Ask your doctor for a \"urinalysis\" to gain additional information about your kidney function.\n\nIn addition to the more basic test of looking for protein in your urine, a \"urinalysis\" also examines your urine under the microscope checking for any red blood cells, white blood cells, or other unusual things that may be present in your urine. This can give your physician additional information about your kidney function, such as whether there is inflammation or infection present.\n\n4. See your physician for a blood test to evaluate your kidney function.\n\nThere are a few different things that can be measured in a blood test that can provide valuable information to your doctor about your kidney function. The two most commonly ordered tests are serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Creatinine is a waste product that accumulates in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly. Elevated levels of serum creatinine may indicate poor kidney function. The eGFR is calculated using your age, sex, race, and serum creatinine levels. This calculation can give your doctor a good estimate of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood.\n\n5. Interpret the significance of your creatinine and eGFR results.\n\nUnderstanding your blood test results can be confusing. Your physician will be able to explain what your test results mean and how they relate to your kidney function. In general, a creatinine level of 1.0 mg\/dL or lower is considered normal for most adults. Your eGFR should be greater than 60 mL\/min\/1.73m2. However, keep in mind that every person's normal range may vary based on age, sex, and other factors.\n\n6. Receive BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine clearance tests.\n\nBUN is another waste product that can build up in the blood when the kidneys are not functioning properly. Elevated levels of BUN may indicate poor kidney function. Creatinine clearance is a more in-depth analysis of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. This test requires collecting urine samples over a 24-hour period. Your physician may recommend this test if they suspect chronic kidney disease.\n\n7. Have your blood pressure measured.\n\nIn addition to receiving both urine tests and blood tests, if your doctor suspects that you may have a kidney problem (either acute or chronic) it is key that you receive regular blood pressure measurements as well.

{"text":"Caesar salad is a classic dish that has been loved for generations. This salad is known for its rich, creamy dressing and crunchy croutons. Making a Caesar salad at home is easy and can be the perfect addition to any meal. This article will guide you through the steps of making a Caesar salad, as well as some helpful tips for making it even more delicious.\n\nPart 1: Making the Dressing\n\n1. Mash the anchovy paste and garlic together in a small bowl with the back of a fork. This will create a fine paste that will be the base for the dressing.\n\n2. Whisk in the oil, grated cheese, vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. This will create a thick and creamy dressing that will coat the lettuce.\n\n3. Slowly add in the mayonnaise. This will thicken the dressing even more and give it a tangy flavor.\n\n4. Taste, and season with salt, pepper, and vinegar or lemon, as needed. This will allow you to adjust the flavor to your liking.\n\nPart 2: Making the Salad\n\n1. Chop the base off of the lettuce and discard it. This will ensure that you only use the crispy, fresh leaves.\n\n2. Wash and dry the lettuce thoroughly. This will remove any dirt or debris that may be on the leaves.\n\n3. Chop the lettuce into bite-sized pieces. This will make the salad easier to eat.\n\n4. Place the lettuce into a large bowl. This will be your base for the salad.\n\n5. Add the grated Parmesan cheese and croutons to the bowl of lettuce. These will add flavor and texture to the salad.\n\n6. Pour the dressing in just before serving the salad. This will prevent the lettuce from wilting.\n\n7. Toss the salad until all the lettuce is covered with the dressing. This will ensure that each bite is full of flavor.\n\n8. Serve the salad immediately. This will ensure that the croutons stay crunchy and the lettuce stays fresh.\n\nPart 3: Making the Croutons\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F (232\u00b0C). This will ensure that the croutons bake evenly.\n\n2. Slice the bread in half, lengthwise, and remove the crust. This will make it easier to cut the bread into cubes.\n\n3. Cut the bread into \u00bc inch (0.64 centimeters) cubes. This size will ensure that the croutons are bite-sized.\n\n4. Melt some butter. This will help the croutons brown in the oven.\n\n5. Mix the melted butter and olive oil in a large bowl. This will coat the croutons and help them cook evenly.\n\n6. Add the croutons into the bowl and toss them until they are coated. This will ensure that each crouton is covered in butter and oil.\n\n7. Season the croutons with salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. This will add flavor to the croutons.\n\n8. Spread the croutons on a 12 by 17 inch (30.48 by 43.18 centimeters) baking sheet. This size will ensure that the croutons have enough space to bake evenly.\n\n9. Bake the croutons for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. This will ensure that the croutons are crispy and delicious.\n\nPart 4: Making Variations\n\n1. Add some grilled chicken for a classic Chicken Caesar salad. This will add protein and make the salad more filling.\n\n2. Try shrimp for a seafood-based Caesar salad. This will add a unique flavor to the salad.\n\n3. Try grilled steak if you don't like chicken or seafood. This will add a hearty flavor that pairs well with the salad.\n\n4. Try it with kale instead of romaine. This will add a different texture to the salad.\n\n5. Consider other additions, but remember to keep it simple. Adding too many ingredients can overwhelm the flavors in the salad.\n\n6. Try another type of cheese for the dressing. Blue cheese or feta can add a new dimension of flavor to the salad.\n\nMaking a Caesar salad at home is easy and delicious. With a few simple steps, you can have a fresh and satisfying salad that will be the perfect addition to any meal.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":171}

{"text":"Creating a secure login script for a PHP and MySQL-based web application is a crucial step in making sure that user data remains protected against unauthorized access and hacking attempts. In this WikiHow article, we will outline a step-by-step guide to help you create a secure login script that uses PHP and MySQL to ensure that user data remains secure.\n\n1. Install a Web Server, PHP and MySQL on your server.\n\nBefore you can begin creating a secure login script, you will need to install a web server, PHP, and MySQL on your server. If you're running a Linux-based server, you can use the following command to install Apache, PHP, and MySQL:\n\nsudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server\n\nOnce you have installed these dependencies, you can proceed with creating your secure login script.\n\n2. Create a MySQL Database\n\nThe first step in creating a secure login script is to create a MySQL database on your server. You can use the following command to create a database:\n\nCREATE DATABASE mydata;\n\nReplace 'mydata' with a database name of your choice. Remember to choose a strong database password and to keep it safe.\n\n3. Create a User with Only SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT Privileges.\n\nAfter creating a MySQL database, you need to create a user with only SELECT, UPDATE, and INSERT privileges. Using these limited privileges will ensure that your database remains secure against malicious external attacks.\n\n4. Create a MySQL Table Named \"Members\".\n\nThe code below creates a table with four fields (id, username, email, password):\n\nCREATE TABLE members (\n  id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n  username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n  email VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL\n);\n\n5. Create a Table to Store Login Attempts.\n\nTo keep track of login attempts, you need to create a table that will hold data about login attempts. Below is the code to create a table for the login attempts:\n\nCREATE TABLE login_attempts (\n  id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n  username VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,\n  time DATETIME NOT NULL\n);\n\n6. Create a Test Row in Table \"Members\".\n\nBefore proceeding further, create a test row in the members table to make sure that your database is working correctly.\n\n7. Create a Global Configurations Page\n\nCreate a global configurations page to store your MySQL username, password, and database name in one central location so that you can change them all at once if needed.\n\n8. Create a Folder Called \"Includes\" in the Root Directory of the Application and Then Create a New PHP File in That Directory.\n\nCreate the include folder within your web application and create a new PHP file within that folder. This file will include the code that connects to the MySQL database.\n\n9. Create the Database Connection Page\n\nThis is the PHP code that we will use to connect to our MySQL database:\n\n<?php\n$db_host = 'localhost';\n$db_name = 'mydata';\n$db_username = 'mydatauser';\n$db_password = '';\n\n$mysqli = new mysqli($db_host, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);\n\nif ($mysqli->connect_error) {\n    die('Error : ('. $mysqli->connect_errno .') '. $mysqli->connect_error);\n}\n?>\n\nMake sure that you replace the variables with your own database details.\n\n10. Securely Start a PHP Session.\n\nStart a PHP session securely using the following code:\n\n<?php\nsession_start();\nsession_regenerate_id(true);\n?>\n\n11. Create the Login Function.\n\nCreate a login function that verifies the entered username and password, and then returns a flag to determine whether the user is logged in.\n\n12. The Brute Force Function.\n\nCreate a brute force function to ensure that hackers don't try to force their way into the system.\n\n13. Check Logged In Status.\n\nCheck whether the user is logged in before displaying any sensitive data.\n\n14. Sanitize URL from PHP_SELF\n\nThe next function sanitizes the output from the PHP_SELF server variable, which protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n15. Create the Login Processing Page (process_login.php)\n\nCreate a file to process logins, called process_login.php, in the application's includes directory.\n\n16. Create a Logout Script\n\nCreate a logout script that logs the user out and destroys the session.\n\n17. Registration Page.\n\nCreate a registration page where new users can create an account.\n\n18. Create sha512.js File\n\nThis file is an implementation in JavaScript of the hashing algorithm sha512.\n\n19. Create Forms.js File\n\nThis file, which you should create in the js directory of the application, will handle the hashing of the passwords for the login (formhash()) and registration (regformhash()) forms:\n\nfunction formhash(form, password) {\n    \/\/ Create a new element input, this will be our hashed password field.\n\n20. Create the Login Form (index.php).\n\nCreate a login form that collects the user's username and password.\n\n21. Create the Register_success.php Page\n\nCreate a new PHP web page called register_success.php, in the root directory of the application.\n\n22. Create the Error Page\n\nCreate a new HTML page in the root directory of the application to display error messages.\n\n23. Page Protection Script.\n\nFinally, create a page protection script that requires users to log in before accessing sensitive pages on your site.\n\nBy following these twenty-three steps, you will have successfully created a secure login script that uses PHP and MySQL to keep your user data secure. Remember to continuously update your script with the latest security patches to ensure that your data remains safe.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":173}

{"text":"How to Store Children's Clothing for a Younger Child to Wear in the Future\n\nAre you holding on to your older child's clothes in hopes that your younger child can wear them in the future? Storing old clothes can be a great way to save money on buying new ones later on. However, improper storage can lead to damaged clothing, and nobody wants their kids to wear moth-eaten clothes. Here's how to store children's clothing for a younger child to wear in the future:\n\n1. Get some big, heavy plastic storage boxes, such as those made by Rubbermaid. The boxes should be sturdy enough to protect the clothes from moisture, dust, and bugs.\n\n2. Get all the clothes that you want to store absolutely CLEAN AND DRY. Wash and dry them thoroughly before putting them in storage. Moths and bugs that eat holes in clothes are not actually interested in eating the fabric; they want the spilled food or other stains on there. So make sure they are clean!\n\n3. If there are torn seams or missing buttons, fix them. This will help preserve the clothes and make them last longer in storage.\n\n4. Sort the clothes by size, according to how much of them you have and how different they are. This will help you keep track of what you have and make it easier to find what you need later on.\n\n5. Get rid of what you can. If a piece of clothing is too badly stained or damaged, it might not be worth storing. Donate it to a local charity or toss it out.\n\n6. If you have a really, really special item like a woolen suit or a taffeta dress, take it to the cleaners and have them pack it in a box for you. They will know how to properly protect and store delicate items.\n\n7. For the regular clothes, make as many piles as you need and figure out how many piles can fit in each box. This will help you maximize your storage space.\n\n8. The best way to store clothes is by rolling them up tight. This will help prevent wrinkles and will make it easier to fit more clothes in each box.\n\n9. Do not use mothballs -- they are very toxic for humans and the smell never really goes away. Instead, you can use cedar chips, lavender sachets, or other natural moth repellents.\n\n10. Add the clothes to the box. Store bigger, heavier items on the bottom, like big sweaters and pants. Be sure to leave enough space for air to circulate.\n\n11. LABEL THE BOXES AS YOU GO. This will help you keep track of what's in each box and make it easier to find what you need later on.\n\n12. Put on lids and store away. Find a dry, cool, and dark place to store the boxes, such as a basement or a closet. Avoid storing them in the attic or garage, as temperature and humidity fluctuations there can damage the clothes.\n\nBy following these simple storage tips, you can keep your older child's clothes in good condition for your younger child to wear in the future. It's a great way to save money and reduce waste!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":179}
{"text":"Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for anyone, but when you're pregnant, there are additional factors to consider. Fortunately, with a little preparation and knowledge, traveling by plane when pregnant can be a safe and stress-free experience. Here are some tips to help you navigate air travel while pregnant.\n\n1. Consult an OB\/GYN, physician, or healthcare provider for individual recommendations about airline travel during pregnancy.\n\nBefore booking your flight, it's important to speak with a healthcare professional about your plans to travel. Many healthcare professionals allow pregnant women to fly for the majority of their pregnancy, provided there are no known complications with the pregnancy, such as a ruptured placenta, gestational diabetes, or hypertension. However, women who have previously experienced a miscarriage, premature delivery, fetal loss, stillbirth, or any of a number of other health risks may not receive approval from an obstetrician or midwife for travel by plane for any occasion during pregnancy, for fear that the current pregnancy is also high-risk. Certain conditions during pregnancy may be aggravated by plane travel, and flying has an unknown effect on many other conditions, making many medical experts cautious of endorsing travel by plane for women experiencing high-risk pregnancies.\n\n2. Inform the airline about your pregnancy.\n\nWhen you book your flight, be sure to inform the airline that you're pregnant. This will allow them to provide you with any assistance you may need, such as extra legroom or early boarding. Depending on how far along you are in your pregnancy, some airlines may also require a doctor's note clearing you for travel.\n\n3. Ask the airline about their restrictions.\n\nEach airline has its own set of policies and restrictions when it comes to pregnant passengers, so it's important to research the airline you'll be traveling with ahead of time. Some airlines may not allow pregnant women to travel after a certain point in their pregnancy, while others may require a letter from your doctor stating that it's safe to travel. Additionally, some airlines may have restrictions on the types of seats pregnant women can book, or may require pregnant women to wear a seatbelt extension during the flight.\n\n4. Be honest with the airline and your doctor.\n\nIt's important to be honest with both the airline and your doctor about your pregnancy and any concerns you may have. If you have any medical conditions or complications related to your pregnancy, it's important to discuss these with both your doctor and the airline to ensure that you are able to travel safely. By being upfront and honest about your pregnancy and any concerns you may have, you can set yourself up for a safe and stress-free flight.\n\nIn summary, traveling by plane when pregnant can be a safe and stress-free experience if you take the necessary precautions. By consulting with your healthcare provider, informing the airline, researching their policies, and being honest about your pregnancy and any concerns you may have, you can ensure a smooth and comfortable journey.

Know your limits when you are in a fight that can be dangerous.\n\nThe first and most important step is to understand the risks involved in a physical altercation. Fighting can cause serious harm, both physically and legally. Before you engage in any form of physical aggression, make sure that you are mentally and physically prepared for the consequences.\n\n2. Have 5-6 months to train for it.\n\nLearning self-defense takes time, patience, and practice. If you are serious about fighting a bully or a group of them, you should consider dedicating at least 5-6 months to train yourself physically and mentally.\n\n3. Make sure you didn't start the fight.\n\nIf you can avoid a confrontation, you should always try to do so. It is not worth it to risk your safety and future opportunities for a fleeting moment of dominance.\n\n4. Get a punching bag, start off with 10kg.\n\nOne of the best ways to train your body for combat is to use a punching bag. Start with a 10kg bag and practice your punches until you can maintain a rhythm for 5 minutes.\n\n5. Punch it, and do not proceed until you can punch for 5 minutes.\n\nDo not move on to more challenging techniques until you have mastered the basics.\n\n6. Have enough sleep\/ water\/ food, but don't have too much of any either.\n\nTo maintain your physical fitness, you need to make sure you are getting enough sleep, food, and water. However, avoid overdoing it with any of these factors as it can lead to unproductive or even harmful results.\n\n7. Master punching the bag for 10 minutes.\n\nOnce you can maintain a rhythm for 5 minutes, push yourself to punch the bag for 10 minutes straight.\n\n8. Stop playing video games, and exercise 5 days a week.\n\nVideo games can be fun, but they do not prepare you for real-life situations. Commit to exercising five days a week to ensure your body is at peak performance.\n\n9. Knock the bag down, and if you do, you have extreme strength.\n\nIf you are capable of knocking down the punching bag, you have developed a high level of strength that can be useful in a physical altercation.\n\n10. Now master punching the bag for 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the same process, continue to increase the amount of time you can punch the bag.\n\n11. Master punch the bag for 20 minutes.\n\nIf you can punch the bag for 20 minutes and maintain a consistent rhythm, you've made significant progress in your physical fitness.\n\n12. Get a new bag that is 16 kg.\n\nTo challenge yourself, upgrade to a heavier 16kg bag.\n\n13. Master knocking down the new one.\n\nOnce again, set the goal of knocking down the new bag to demonstrate your strength and technique.\n\n14. Master punching the new bag 30 minutes.\n\nWith practice, aim to punch the 16kg bag for 30 minutes.\n\n15. Fill the bag with sand, so it is 22 kg, if already with sand, get a new one.\n\nFor greater resistance, fill the bag with sand until it reaches 22kg. If your bag is already filled with sand, consider purchasing a heavier one.\n\n16. Master knocking it down.\n\nChallenge yourself and aim to knock down the 22kg sand-filled bag.\n\n17. Get a new bag that weighs 30 kg with water.\n\nTo further improve your physical conditioning, purchase a new bag that weighs 30kg with water.\n\n18. Master knocking that down as well.\n\nPractice punching the new bag until you can knock it down consistently.\n\n19. Master knocking down a 38 kg bag; now you can punch a 3rd grader, and knock him down.\n\nOnce you are able to knock down a 38kg bag, you have developed a significant amount of strength and technique that can potentially knock down a child. However, it is never acceptable to use violence against a child or anyone who is not threatening your well-being.\n\n20. Get a new bag that is 50kg, and master knocking it down.\n\nContinue to challenge yourself and purchase a new bag that weighs 50kg. Aim to master knocking it down with your punches.\n\n21. Master reflexes.\n\nReacting quickly is essential in combat. Train your reflexes by practicing dodging and blocking techniques.\n\n22. Master dodging it.\n\nPractice avoiding punches and strikes by developing your dodging skills.\n\n23. Talk it out.\n\nIf possible, try to resolve the situation without resorting to violence. Communication and compromise are often better alternatives.\n\n24. Don't tell on him.\n\nWhile you may be tempted to inform authorities or a higher power, this can often escalate the situation and increase your risk.\n\n25. Tell him to meet somewhere and fight.\n\nIf you must engage with a bully or group of them, try to control the situation by suggesting a time and location to meet.\n\n26. Go to the area on the day.\n\nBe prepared and show up to the agreed-upon location and time.\n\n27. Don't tease him, just try to avoid him, and he will be afraid of you.\n\nWhile you should not tolerate bullying, avoid being provocative or making things worse. In many cases, avoiding a bully can cause them to lose interest in your vulnerability.\n\n28. Tell on each harassment.\n\nIf you experience harassment or bullying, report it to a trusted authority figure. It's important to discuss these issues with someone who can help resolve the problem and prevent it from happening again.\n\nBy following these steps, you can learn how to fight a bully or group of them while prioritizing your safety and well-being. Remember, violence should always be the last resort, and it's essential to approach situations with a thoughtful and strategic mindset.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":183}

{"text":"Creating a website can be daunting, but using a website builder can make the process a lot easier. However, just having a website is not enough to make it successful. To promote your website and increase your rankings, you need to implement a variety of tactics. Below are some steps you can take to boost your website's visibility:\n\n1. Utilize meta tags\nWith the keywords you have chosen for your site, create a title and description for each web page. A good website builder will generally have these options built-in, and all you will have to do is create a quick and descriptive title tag and brief description and insert it into the required section so that search engines pick up what your website is all about.\n\n2. Create quality content\nEnsure that your keywords are used throughout your content, without affecting the quality and readability of the text. Aim to use your keywords mostly at the beginning and end of each paragraph. There are many SEO consultants who advocate this method of on-page optimization.\n\n3. Optimize your images\nWhile images are more to catch the eye rather than for search engine purposes, you can still do certain things to help search engines pick them up. Ensure that the file name of your image is descriptive, it has an alt tag and try to make sure that your images are not too large, as this can slow down your site or web page load time.\n\n4. Submit Your Website to Major Search Engines\nEnsure that you submit and verify your website with the three major search engines. Once submitted and verified, your website will show up in search results.\n\n5. Use Article Directories\nArticles are a great way to get good rankings and also to get good amounts of traffic. Submitting 3-4 articles a week can have a significant impact on your rankings. Submit your articles to your blog to increase quality and relevant content on your site, then syndicate your articles by submitting them to article directories and other articles resources.\n\n6. Blog Commenting\nBlogs are a great way to get a few quick backlinks to your website and for building content on your own website. When commenting on other peoples blogs, don't just drop links for the fun of it, try to add a little comment that relates to the website owner's blog post and drop a link somewhere inside your comment using an html link code so that it doesn't sound too spammy.\n\n7. Utilize Forums\nForums are a good way of getting backlinks to your website and for getting targeted traffic to your site via posting on forums that are relevant to your field. However, forum code and inserting links into forums is slightly different than blogs as you will require a different sort of code to create a backlink known as BB code.\n\nKeep in mind that while these tactics can help boost your website's visibility initially, the key to long-term success is quality content and regular updates. By continually providing value to your audience, you can build a loyal following that will help drive traffic to your website and ensure it stays relevant and successful in the long run.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":187}
{"text":"How to Treat Childhood Nephrotic Syndrome\n\nChildhood nephrotic syndrome is a kidney condition that affects children. It is characterized by protein in the urine, swelling, and a decrease in the amount of protein in the blood. If your child has been diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, there are several steps you can take to help manage the condition. In this article, we'll discuss how to treat childhood nephrotic syndrome with active home monitoring, medication and lifestyle changes.\n\nPart 1: Active Home Monitoring\n\n1. Keep track of your child's weight. Nephrotic syndrome causes excess fluid to build up in the body, leading to swelling. You can monitor this by weighing your child daily, ideally at the same time each day.\n\n2. Monitor your child's urine output. To make sure the kidneys are functioning properly, monitor how much urine your child produces each day. This is especially important during episodes of swelling.\n\n3. Take note of any changes in your child's appetite. Swelling in the abdomen can cause a loss of appetite. Pay attention to your child's eating habits and consult with a doctor if you notice any significant changes.\n\nPart 2: Medical Treatment\n\n1. Prednisone. Steroids such as prednisone are often used to treat nephrotic syndrome. They work by reducing inflammation in the body. Your child may be prescribed a high dose initially, then gradually decrease to a lower maintenance dose.\n\n2. Calcineurin inhibitors. If prednisone is ineffective or causes too many side effects, calcineurin inhibitors may be used instead. These help regulate the immune response in the body.\n\n3. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). This medication is often used in combination with prednisone or calcineurin inhibitors to help suppress the immune system.\n\n4. Alkylating agents. If other treatments are not effective, these medications may be used. They work by suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation, but they can also increase the risk of developing cancer.\n\n5. Diuretics. These medications help remove excess fluid from the body. Care should be taken when using diuretics, as they may cause electrolyte imbalances.\n\n6. Albumin. If your child's blood albumin levels drop too low, they may receive albumin infusions to boost the levels.\n\nPart 3: Lifestyle Changes\n\n1. Limiting salt intake. Sodium can contribute to swelling, so it's important to limit your child's salt intake. Avoid adding extra salt to meals and choose low-sodium options whenever possible.\n\n2. Drinking less water. While it's important to stay hydrated, drinking too much water can contribute to swelling. Encourage your child to drink the recommended amount of water each day and avoid overhydration.\n\n3. Eating healthy. A balanced diet can help manage nephrotic syndrome. Focus on foods that are low in salt and high in nutrients.\n\n4. Exercising regularly. Exercise can help improve kidney function and maintain a healthy weight. Speak with your doctor about an appropriate exercise plan for your child.\n\n5. Reducing edema. You can help reduce swelling by using the head out of water immersion technique, which involves keeping your child's head above water while they swim.\n\n6. Monitoring cholesterol levels. Nephrotic syndrome can cause changes in cholesterol levels, so it's important to monitor your child's levels and adjust their diet as needed.\n\n7. Watching for complications. Nephrotic syndrome can increase the risk of infection and thrombosis. Be aware of these risks and take appropriate precautions.\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging childhood nephrotic syndrome can be challenging, but with the right treatment and lifestyle changes, it can be controlled. Be sure to work closely with your child's doctor to develop an effective treatment plan. By carefully monitoring your child's health and making changes where necessary, you can help keep your child healthy and happy.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":188}

{"text":"How to Survive a Dirty Bomb (Radiological Dispersion Device)\n\nA dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersion device (RDD), is a weapon that combines conventional explosives with radioactive material. The explosion scatters radioactive particles and dust throughout the surrounding area, causing radiation poisoning, sickness, and death. While the likelihood of being affected by an RDD attack is low, it's important to know how to survive a dirty bomb just in case. Here's how to prepare and respond to a radiological dispersion device.\n\n1. Take preventative measures as you would for a nuclear fallout.\nThe best way to survive an RDD attack is to avoid exposure to radiation. If you live or work near potential targets, such as government buildings or landmarks, take precautions such as stocking up on non-perishable food, water, and medical supplies; identifying shelter locations; and staying informed about local emergency response plans.\n\n2. Add plastic sheeting, duct tape, and scissors to your disaster supplies kit if not already present.\nIn the event of an RDD attack, you may need to seal off doors, windows, and air vents to prevent radioactive particles from entering your home or building. Keep a roll of plastic sheeting, duct tape, and a pair of scissors in your disaster supplies kit for this purpose.\n\n3. Know the different variables of an RDD strike.\nAn RDD attack can happen in many ways, including in the air, on the ground, or through water. The extent of the damage depends on the type and amount of radioactive material used and the distance from the explosion.\n\n4. Assume radiological contamination has occurred and take the proper precautions.\nIf you are within the blast radius of an RDD attack, assume that you have been exposed to radioactive material. Don't panic, but take immediate action to protect yourself and your loved ones.\n\n5. Breathe through the cloth of your shirt or coat to help filter out dust or other contaminants in the air.\nCover your nose and mouth with a cloth to prevent inhaling contaminated particles. If possible, use a damp cloth to filter out more particles.\n\n6. Seek shelter indoors immediately in the nearest undamaged building if you are outside.\nIf you're outside during an RDD attack, seek shelter immediately in the nearest building that's not damaged.

Here are some tips to help you get over an inter religious relationship break up:\n\n1. Accept that it is over for good.\n\nThe first step in getting over a break up is accepting that it is over. This can be especially hard in an inter religious relationship because of the societal and family limitations of what defines a marriage. It is important to remind yourself that simply succumbing to these limitations is not a viable option for a happy relationship.\n\n2. Realize that they simply did not have the faith and courage to stand up for themselves and their beliefs for love.\n\nIt can be painful to realize that your partner did not have the courage to fight for the relationship in the face of religious differences. However, it is important to remember that they may have felt societal or familial pressure to conform to one religion. This does not mean you were not loved or valued enough.\n\n3. Erase all texts, e-mails, pictures, phone numbers of this person.\n\nTo move forward, it is important to let go of the past. This means deleting all text messages, e-mails, pictures, phone numbers and anything else that reminds you of your ex-partner.  \n\n4. Work out your steps as you move on, it can be hard because you had so perfectly carved out a future with this person.\n\nWhen a relationship ends, it can be hard to envision a future without that person. It is important to take things one step at a time and start building a new future for yourself.\n\n5. Do not self-destruct.\n\nIt is important to avoid self-destructive behaviors such as binge drinking, drug use, chain smoking, rebound relationships, or self-injurious behavior. These behaviors may provide a temporary escape from the pain, but they do not offer a long-term solution to recovering from a break up. \n\n6. Writing down your thoughts and feelings is one proven way to help you deal with it.\n\nWriting down your thoughts and feelings is a proven method to help you deal with the pain of a break up. It not only helps you process your emotions, but it also serves as a reminder of how far you have come from that painful experience.\n\n7. See a counselor or a therapist.\n\nTalking to a professional can help you work through the complex emotions associated with ending an inter religious relationship. This does not mean you are crazy or suffering from some mental illness. It simply means you are seeking guidance and support during a difficult time.\n\n8. Travel.\n\nA change of scenery can do wonders for the soul. Taking a trip or vacation can help you take your mind off things and focus on the present.\n\n9. Lean on friends and family.\n\nMost break ups are healed with the help of friends and family. They provide a support network that can help you through the tough times.\n\n10. Resist the temptation to look back and find out what your ex and their friends are up to.\n\nIt can be tempting to look back and check in on your ex-partner's life. However, this will only delay your healing process and prevent you from moving on.\n\n11. When things are broken, it makes you realize what you don't want and what you need.\n\nSometimes a break up is necessary to realize what you truly need and want from a relationship. This realization can lead to a better future.\n\n12. Life this is, and move on we must.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that life goes on. As painful as it may be, it is important to keep moving forward and not get stuck in the past. \n\nGood luck and calm down! Remember, you are not alone in this struggle and there is hope for a better future.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":201}

This means avoiding revealing or inappropriate clothing and choosing comfortable, clean outfits that project a positive image.\n\n2. Decide what teacher you wish to be the \"pet\" to.\n\nEvery student has a teacher they admire or connect with more than others.

Always do your homework, and if possible, go the extra step and talk to your teacher about what you can do to improve your knowledge on the subject.\n\nCompleting your homework assignments and turning them in on time may seem obvious, but it's also important to take the time to ask your teacher questions and seek feedback.

{"text":"How to Play Offensive in Ping Pong'\n\nAre you tired of playing defensively in ping pong? Want to switch things up and become more offensive? Well, look no further! In this article, we will guide you through the steps to playing offensive in ping pong.\n\n1. Warm up before playing.\n\nBefore playing any sport, it's essential to warm up your muscles to avoid injuries. In ping pong, a quick warm-up routine can consist of arm swings and rotating your wrists. Additionally, you can hit the ball with the bat slowly, and then gradually increase your speed to moderate, and eventually fairly fast.\n\n2. Practice.\n\nTo become more offensive in ping pong, practice makes perfect. As a beginner, you must learn the different types of offensive strokes, such as a loop drive, forehand drive, and backhand drive. The loop drive is considered the primary attacking stroke of serious players today.\n\n3. Understand the loop drive.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the loop drive is vital when playing offensive in ping pong. Depending on the incoming ball's characteristics, the loop must be modified to hit the ball correctly. For the forehand loop, position your right foot slightly back while transferring your weight to it. For the backhand loop, your backswing should go in front of your legs, and make sure to drop your right shoulder somewhat.\n\n4. Notes on the loop.\n\nSince the loop drive requires a lot of paddle speed, the extra backswing, bending of the knees, waist rotation, weight transfer, and wrist snap at contact are all needed.\n\n5. Forehand and Backhand drive.\n\nThe forehand drive involves keeping your upper arm close to your torso but not entirely flush. As for the backhand drive, keep your waist turned left, with the racket pointing towards the 9 o'clock position.\n\nIn conclusion, these are the advanced and basic terms for playing offensive ping pong.

{"text":"Changing the timing belt on a Mazda 626 can be a daunting task, but with the right tools and some mechanical know-how, it can be done. Follow these steps to ensure the job is done correctly and avoid engine damage.\n\nObtain a manual for your specific Mazda 626 model and make sure it has torquing instructions for bolts. This will ensure that you tighten the bolts to the manufacturer's specifications, preventing any damage to the engine.\n\nWork on level ground and make sure the car is properly braced. Block the wheels with bricks or wooden pieces about the size of bricks to prevent them from rolling away while you're working on the engine.\n\nAvoid engine damage from the timing belt breaking, slipping, or the tensioner pulley or idler pulley locking up (seizing) or the timing belt skipping one or more cogs on a sprocket causing valve timing problems and possibly breaking valves, pistons, and\/or the engine cylinder (block).\n\nUnderstand the numbering of the cylinders and label the spark plug cables and cylinders 1, 2, 3, 4 from left to right. The other end is not that easy, so carefully pry and get the cables off their spark plugs. Check your manual for firing order, which will be 1, 3, 4, 2 or such for 1993--1997 (verify this carefully) and 1, 4, 3, 2 or such for 1998 and after for how they plug onto the coil pack or distributor on older models. Caution: Disconnect the negative battery terminal so your engine cannot be inadvertently turned or started in error. Also, remove the spark plugs before doing dangerous work (their removal releases compression, which makes the engine turn easily, as well as work being safer).\n\nDrain all the coolant from the engine and keep it to use again or dispose of it legally, no matter how little.\n\nRemove the accessory belt(s) for the alternator, power steering, air conditioner, etc. For older models with two accessory belts, loosen the lock bolts on the tensioner bolts before turning the long tensioner bolt. For the power steering pump, remove the three bolts holding the power steering pump to release the power steering pump bracket from the engine (12mm and 14mm), but without opening or unsealing the power steering hoses, or you will need to drain it and refill it when finished. Loosen the long bolt of alternator pivoting bracket on the alternator belt to allow the adjustable accessory to pivot as tension is released. If your newer model is equipped with a serpentine belt, follow those instructions in your manual and obey the diagram.\n\nOnce the accessory belts are removed, you can access the timing belt cover. Remove the cover and inspect the timing belt for any damage, like cracks, fraying or missing teeth. If you notice any damage, it's best to replace the timing belt immediately.\n\nLoosen the tensioner pulley and remove the timing belt from the engine. Carefully inspect the timing belt tensioner and idler pulleys for wear or damage and replace them if necessary.\n\nInstall the new timing belt, making sure to align the marks on the camshaft and crankshaft sprockets with the timing marks on the engine block. Tighten the tensioner pulley to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nReinstall the accessory belts and refill the coolant. Start the engine and check for any strange noises or vibrations.\n\nBy following these steps, you can change the timing belt on a 2.0L, 4-cylinder Mazda 626, model years 1993 to 2002, and avoid causing any damage to the engine. If you're not confident in your mechanical abilities, it's best to take your vehicle to a professional mechanic.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":212}

If he or she refuses to walk any further, don't make him or her.\nIf your small dog refuses to walk any further, it may be time to carry them home.

{"text":"How to Argue Free Market Morality (Pro Capitalism)\n\nWhen it comes to discussing capitalism and the free market, it can be a contentious topic. Proponents of free market capitalism argue that it is the most moral economic system as it allows people to freely engage in voluntary transactions, while others argue that it lacks morality and creates inequality. If you are looking to argue in favor of capitalism and the free market, there are a few points you can make to strengthen your argument. \n\n1. Allow the free market to call for voluntary actions between individuals and yourself, for instance. The free market is characterized by voluntary exchange, meaning that individuals engage in transactions as mutually consenting parties. This is what makes capitalism a moral system as it is based on the individual's right to create value and trade it with others. \n\n2. Think of money that you've earned as a \"certificate of performance,\" in a free market. In a free economy, money represents the value you create for others in the marketplace. Whether you are selling a product or providing a service, you are rewarded for your efforts. This motivates individuals to improve their productivity, innovate, and create value for society. \n\n3. Decide whether the free market is lacking morality because people say \"It's a zero-sum game, like poker, where if you win, it means that I lose\". The Zero-sum game theory suggests that there is a winner and a loser in every transaction. However, in a free market, both parties can benefit from a transaction. When two parties agree to a transaction, both parties believe that they are better off than before the transaction. \n\n4. Realize it's the government, not the free market, that can cause a zero-sum game in our economy. When the government intervenes in the free market, it can create winners and losers, redistributing wealth and resources in an arbitrary way. By creating systems of regulation, taxation, and subsidies, the government can create a zero-sum game in which some individuals benefit at the expense of others. \n\n5. Examine big business: \"What about corporations?\". Some people argue that big business can be harmful to society and lead to monopolies. However, in a truly free market, there are few barriers to entry, meaning that anyone can enter the market and compete. Additionally, corporations that engage in unethical behavior are held accountable by the market's natural corrective mechanisms, such as consumers boycotting products. \n\n6. Consider the example of the American automobile industry where positive action was undone by politicians\/government. The American automobile industry was bailed out by the government in response to the financial crisis of 2008. However, this bailout created a moral hazard, as car-makers were no longer held accountable to consumers and stockholders. \n\n7. Check whether the government bailing out the auto industry said to car-makers: \"You don't have to be accountable to customers and stockholders.\". As a result of the bailout, car-makers could continue to produce cars that were less fuel-efficient and technologically advanced, instead of responding to market demand. This is a prime example of how government intervention can undermine the free market's morality by disrupting the natural incentive structure. \n\n8. Look for a more solvent system than the free market. While free-market capitalism is not perfect, it is often the most effective economic system in terms of promoting individual rights and overall prosperity. Any alternative system that is not based on voluntary exchange would have to rely on coercion and the violation of individual rights. \n\n9. Give and insist upon receiving just treatment in good faith, as each one seeks not his\/her own benefit only, but to measure things honestly, working to ensure a fair and balanced transactional win-win outcome together. When engaging in transactions in the free market, it is important to treat others with fairness and honesty while seeking to create mutually beneficial outcomes. The pursuit of self-interest can be moral if it is guided by ethical principles that promote cooperation, honesty, and fairness. \n\nIn conclusion, the free market and capitalism can be morally justifiable economic systems. By allowing individuals to engage in voluntary exchange, creating incentives to create value for others, and holding individuals accountable for their actions, the free market promotes individual rights and prosperity.

This section provides information about the company's executive compensation and will help you understand how the company is compensating its leaders.\n\nLook for actual, not adjusted, earnings\n\nAdjusted earnings may provide a rosier picture of a company's financial health but may not be reflective of the actual performance. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on actual earnings to make informed investment decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, reading an annual report can seem daunting, but by following these steps, you can gain a better understanding of the company's financial position and make informed decisions.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":217}

{"text":"Battlefield 2 is a popular first-person shooter that requires strategy, coordination, and skill to succeed. If you want to own at this game, there are a few tips and tricks you can follow. Whether you prefer using a medic, a jet, or any other class, we've got you covered. Read on to learn how to dominate the virtual battlefield.\n\nMethod 1: Starting as a Medic\n\n1. Choose the medic class and unlock the G36E (the last medic unlock). To access this weapon, you need to have played the expansion, Special Forces, on your account at least once. Once you have unlocked it, make sure to use it as much as possible. It has a high rate of fire, low recoil, and good accuracy, making it a deadly weapon in the right hands.\n\n2. Revive as many people as possible. As a medic, your primary role is to heal and revive your teammates. Make sure to keep an eye on fallen allies and use your defibrillator to bring them back to life. This will not only help your team but also earn you points and keep you alive longer.\n\n3. Spam medic bags in populated areas. Medic bags can heal multiple teammates at once, so make sure to drop them in high-traffic areas such as choke points, spawn points, and objectives. This will not only help your team stay alive but also earn you points and level up your skills.\n\n4. Be aware of your surroundings and popular player routes. Knowing the map and where players tend to go can help you anticipate enemy movements and avoid getting ambushed. Make sure to use cover, stay with your squad, and communicate with your team to maximize your chances of survival.\n\n5. Use a good mouse and keyboard. Having a high-quality gaming setup can make a big difference in your performance. Make sure to use a mouse and keyboard that are comfortable, responsive, and customizable. Experiment with different sensitivity settings, keybinds, and macros to find what works best for you.\n\n6. Own it up. With these tips and tricks, you should be able to dominate the game as a medic. Make sure to practice, communicate, and adapt to different situations to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nMethod 2: Using a Jet\n\n1. Create an offline server for Gulf of Oman 64 player size. This map is ideal for practicing jet flying and bombing runs, as it has plenty of open space and targets to practice on.\n\n2. Once you're good enough, go online. Flying a jet in multiplayer requires skill, timing, and coordination with your team. Make sure to communicate with your squadmates, spot enemy vehicles and targets, and avoid getting shot down by enemy jets and AA guns.\n\n3. Stay above 200 feet (61.0 m) and constantly look behind you. This will prevent you from getting hit by enemy missiles or bullets and give you a better view of the battlefield.\n\n4. Drop downwards when you find a target. This will line up your crosshairs with your target and make it easier to hit. Make sure to pull up after dropping your bombs to avoid crashing into the ground.\n\n5. Follow and shoot down enemy jets. This requires skill and practice, as you need to anticipate their movements, lead your shots, and avoid getting hit by their bullets. Make sure to communicate with your team and use your flares and afterburners wisely.\n\n6. Stay alive at all costs. If you get shot down, you'll have to wait for a long time before you can fly again. Make sure to use cover, evade enemy fire, and repair your jet whenever possible. This will keep you alive longer and allow you to contribute more to your team's victory.\n\nWith these tips and tricks, you should be able to dominate the virtual skies and lead your team to victory.

{"text":"High levels of potassium in the body can be a serious concern. In most cases, high potassium levels are caused by kidney disease or medication use. Other causes are rare, but it is important to understand the risks associated with high potassium levels. If you are experiencing symptoms related to high potassium levels, it is important to seek medical attention right away. In this article, we will discuss how to lower potassium levels, starting with the most crucial steps.\n\n1. Understand that problems with high potassium are generally the result of kidney disease or medication use. There are other causes, but these two are the most common by far.\n\n2. Get an electrocardiogram. Because high potassium can be so dangerous to the heart (and because heart symptoms are one of the major ways to diagnose it), your doctor will want to get you an electrocardiogram (a test that evaluates your heart's rate and rhythm pattern) as quickly as possible if your levels are significantly elevated.\n\n3. Review your list of current medications with your doctor. Some medications can cause high potassium levels, so it is important to discuss your medications with your doctor.\n\n4. Have an IV inserted. Assuming your potassium is high enough to warrant more aggressive medical treatment, your doctor will ask the nurse to insert an IV line as this can help to deliver the appropriate treatments more effectively and efficiently.\n\n5. Ask about diuretics. Diuretics are medications that help to remove excess fluids and electrolytes from the body. Your doctor may suggest this treatment to help lower your potassium levels.\n\n6. Have hemodialysis. In severe cases of high potassium levels, hemodialysis may be necessary. This treatment involves removing some of your blood and filtering it through a machine to remove excess electrolytes and fluids.\n\n7. Continue to be monitored by doctors post-treatment. After receiving medical treatment for high potassium levels, it is important to continue to be monitored by doctors to ensure that your levels remain within a healthy range.\n\n8. Modify your diet. In some cases, a high-potassium diet can be a contributing factor to high potassium levels. Your doctor may suggest that you modify your diet to help lower your potassium levels.\n\n9. Watch for cardiac symptoms. High potassium levels can be dangerous to the heart, so it is important to watch for symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and irregular heartbeat.\n\n10. Pay attention to nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can be symptoms of high potassium levels and can also contribute to dehydration, which can further exacerbate the problem.\n\n11. Look for fatigue and weakness. Potassium helps muscles function, so if you have too much or too little, your muscles can weaken, making you feel weak, tired, and lethargic.\n\n12. Be aware of any numbness or tingling sensations. Feelings of numbness or tingling are also related to muscle activity.\n\n13. Understand that you may have no symptoms at all. In some cases, high potassium levels may not cause any symptoms at all, which is why it is important to have your potassium levels checked regularly if you have risk factors such as kidney disease or medications that can affect potassium levels.\n\nIn conclusion, high potassium levels can be a serious concern, but there are steps you can take to lower your levels. Whether through lifestyle changes, medical treatments, or a combination of both, working with your doctor to manage your potassium levels is key to maintaining your health and wellbeing.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":225}
{"text":"How to Get a Thigh Gap\n\nA thigh gap has become a popular trend in recent years, with many women striving to achieve this look. However, it's important to understand that a thigh gap is not physically possible for most people, and trying to achieve it can lead to unhealthy habits. If you do decide to try to get a thigh gap, it's important to set realistic expectations and not let it become an obsession. Here's how:\n\n1. Understand that a thigh gap is not physically possible for most people. The gap between your thighs is determined by the width of your hips and the placement of your pelvic bones. For some people, it's simply not possible to achieve a thigh gap no matter how much weight they lose or exercises they do.\n\n2. Set realistic expectations. Even if you are able to achieve a thigh gap, it may not look like what you see in pictures. Remember that everyone's body is different, and focus on being healthy rather than achieving a certain look.\n\n3. Don't let a thigh gap become your obsession. It's important to have a healthy relationship with your body and not to fixate on one particular aspect of it.\n\n4. Ask for help if you think that your quest for a thigh gap is turning unhealthy. If you find yourself engaging in unhealthy eating or exercise habits, it's important to reach out for help from a trusted friend, family member, or professional.\n\n5. Know that some girls never achieve thigh gap because of their genetics. Genetics play a significant role in the shape of your body, so it's important to be realistic about what is achievable for you.\n\n6. If you do decide to achieve a thigh gap, use a combination of healthy dieting and exercise. Here are some tips:\n\n- Remove junk food from your diet and focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods.\n- Fill up on fiber to help you feel full and maintain a healthy weight.\n- Include some superfoods into your diet, such as leafy greens, berries, and lean protein sources.\n- Avoid overeating and focus on portion control.\n- Try butterfly stretches, Pilates leg lifts, inner-thigh presses, and aerobic exercise to tone your legs without bulking them up.\n\n7. Slip on shapewear to create the illusion of a thigh gap. While this is a temporary solution, it can help you feel more confident in your clothes.\n\n8. Try an anti-cellulite cream and consider dry body brushing to improve the appearance of your legs.\n\n9. Create the illusion of toned legs with self-tanner. Apply self-tanner to your legs to make them appear more toned and defined.\n\n10. Know that you may be able to get the thigh gap in pictures by repositioning your body. Here are some tips:\n\n- Straighten your legs and stand with your feet slightly apart.\n- Stick your butt out a little bit to create more space between your thighs.\n- Bend forward with your heels apart to further accentuate the gap.\n- Take your picture from a low angle to further enhance the appearance of a gap.\n\n11. Wait out puberty. Your body may still be going through changes during puberty, so it's important to give it time to develop.\n\n12. Know when to see a doctor. If you are engaging in unhealthy habits or are experiencing negative physical or mental health effects from your quest for a thigh gap, it's important to seek help from a medical professional.\n\nRemember that a thigh gap is just one small aspect of your body, and that being healthy and happy is the most important thing.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":226}

{"text":"How to Channel: Deciding Between Exploring Your Consciousness and Communing with the Spirit World\n\nChanneling is the practice of connecting with entities or energies outside of yourself for the purpose of receiving guidance, knowledge, or inspiration. There are many different ways to channel, and each method has its own strengths and limitations. In this article, we'll explore some tips and techniques for channeling, as well as how to decide whether to focus on exploring your consciousness or communing with the spirit world.\n\nPart 1: Exploring Your Consciousness\n\n1. Be open to wrestling with strange phenomena. Channeling often involves encountering experiences that challenge your sense of what is possible or real. To be an effective channel, you need to be willing to embrace the unknown and sometimes uncomfortable aspects of your own mind.\n\n2. Ask a very specific question. Before you begin any channeling session, take some time to articulate exactly what you hope to learn or achieve. This will help you stay focused and get the most out of your experience.\n\n3. Start keeping a dream journal. Your dreams can be a rich source of insight and inspiration. Writing them down can help you remember and interpret them more effectively.\n\n4. Meditate deeply, focusing on your breathing. Quieting your mind and connecting with your breath can help you get into a deeper state of relaxation and receptivity.\n\n5. Practice visualization. Visualize yourself falling deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation, as if sinking down into a pool of warm water.\n\n6. Stop controlling your visualizations and allow them to unfold on their own. Don't get too hung up on the details or try to force a certain outcome. Instead, focus on letting go and allowing the experience to unfold.\n\n7. Visualize a location where you feel safe and comfortable. This might be a favorite childhood spot, a natural setting like a forest or beach, or even a cozy room in your home.\n\n8. Let people and entities come into the location. As you focus on the space you've visualized, let the people or entities you are seeking to connect with enter the scene. Don't try to control who comes or what they say - just stay open and receptive.\n\nPart 2: Communing with the Spirit World\n\n1. Find a figure that's willing to speak with you. In some cases, you may want to specifically seek out contact with a particular entity or spirit. This could be a spirit guide, an ancestor, or even a deceased loved one.\n\n2. Look for symbols and archetypes to interpret. When you're communicating with spirits or other non-physical entities, they may communicate through symbolic language. It's up to you to interpret these symbols and find their relevance to your question or situation.\n\n3. Use the ouija board. This is a tool for communicating with spirits that involves a board with letters and numbers, along with a pointer or planchette that moves over the board to spell out messages.\n\n4. Experiment with scrying, sciomancy, and other methods of divination. These methods often involve gazing into a reflective surface, such as a crystal ball or a mirror, and allowing images or insights to arise.\n\n5. Try EVP, trumpet-channeling, or other sound methods. These approaches involve using sound recordings or instruments to pick up messages from entities that are beyond the physical realm.\n\n6. Experiment with automatic writing. This involves allowing your hand to write without thinking about what you're doing, and seeing what messages arise.\n\n7. Consider letting chance affect your query. One technique for opening up to the wisdom of the universe is to allow chance to determine the question you ask. For example, draw a random tarot card or flip open a book to a random page and use the message you find there as the basis for your inquiry.\n\nPart 3: Tips for Effective Channeling\n\n1. Cleanse yourself for reception before the channel opens. You can do this through meditation, prayer, or visualization, imagining a beam of pure white light cleansing and purifying your energy.\n\n2. Gradually deepen your trance by practicing. Channeling often requires a deeply relaxed, open, and receptive state of mind. The more you practice accessing this state, the easier it will become.\n\n3. Test the strength of your consciousness. During a channeling session, be aware of any thoughts, emotions, or sensations that arise. If you're feeling particularly distracted or off-balance, try some grounding exercises or take a break before continuing.\n\n4. Use the power of suggestion to slow your body's rhythms. This can include breathing exercises, counting slowly to ten, or repeating a calming phrase to yourself.\n\n5. End each trance meditation slowly. As you come out of your deep state of relaxation, take some time to reorient yourself to your body and your surroundings gradually. Don't rush back into your day-to-day life too suddenly.\n\n6. Develop an intense personal relationship with the source. Whether you're exploring your own consciousness or connecting with other entities, it's important to maintain a strong connection and sense of trust in the source of your guidance.\n\n7. Record everything. Whether you're using a voice recorder, a notebook, or another method, keeping track of your channeling experiences can help you better understand your own process and find deeper layers of insight.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":232}
{"text":"Landing a taildragger can be a bit more challenging than landing a tricycle landing gear aircraft. However, with a bit of practice, you can become a pro at landing a taildragger. In this article, we will show you step by step the process of landing a taildragger.\n\nPerform a similar pattern\nThe first step in landing a taildragger is to perform a good pattern. Before landing, you need to make sure that you have a good approach. This involves flying a rectangular pattern around the runway. This will help you to line up with the runway and come in for a smooth landing. This pattern is also known as a circuit.\n\nWarm up the rudders\nBefore landing, it is important to warm up the rudders. This will ensure that the rudders respond properly during landing. To warm up the rudders, you should move the rudder pedals back and forth a few times.\n\nKeep the nose down or the horizon line around 3\/4 up the windshield\nAs you approach the runway, make sure that you keep the nose down or the horizon line around 3\/4 up the windshield. This will put you close to your best gliding ratio and prevent you from entering into a spin.\n\nApproach the runway always aligned with the center line\nIt is important to approach the runway while being aligned with the center line. This will give you maximum separation from the edge of the runway or obstacles within it. This will also ensure that you have a smooth landing.\n\nPower to idle and barely pull the stick back\nOnce you get over the numbers, pull the power to idle, and barely pull the stick back to compensate for the loss of power. Gliding down the runway until you are around 2 or 3 feet (0.6 or 0.9 m) above the runway, use the ground effect to help you glide. Eventually, you should have the stick all the way by your stomach, without being able to pull more. When that happens, you should softly fall into a shallow stall with the three tires on the ground (three-point landing).\n\nTake wind direction and speed into account\nOne of the most important things to consider when landing a taildragger is wind direction and speed. This means that you will come into final approach either looking through the side window (Left or right). Let's say that your runway is 36 but the wind direction is 030 @ 15 mph (24 km\/h). You will need to find the exact amount of turn and rudder you will need to maintain heading 360 without being blown away to your left.\n\nMaintain the nose down to maintain airspeed\nTo maintain a smooth landing, it is essential to maintain the nose down to maintain airspeed. This will ensure that the aircraft stays in control and lands safely on the runway.\n\nInput right aileron when left wheel starts to come down\nOnce over the numbers, power to idle and pull slightly backward. As the left wheel starts to come down, input right aileron accordingly so you keep the airplane from flipping.\n\nKeep the elevator input with the stick all the way back when Upwind\nOnce on taxiing, make sure that you keep elevator input with the stick all the way back when Upwind, so the tail wheel stays on the ground. When turning, make sure the stick is turned INTO the wind. This will ensure that the aircraft stays level and does not tip over.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, landing a taildragger requires practice, patience, and a good approach. With the steps provided above, you can become a pro at landing a taildragger. Always remember to maintain airspeed, take wind direction and speed into account, and keep the nose down to ensure a smooth landing. With these tips, you can become a successful taildragger pilot.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":233}

In this article, you'll learn about the basics of the Hydrogen Atom, its isotopes, its chemical reactions, and much more.\n\nUnderstanding the Structure of the Hydrogen Atom\n\nThe Hydrogen atom is made up of a single proton in its nucleus and an electron in its outer shell. Among the chemical elements, it is the most abundant of all, making up about 75% of the universe's elemental mass. It is the simplest element in the periodic table and can be found in water, organic compounds, and in the atmosphere.\n\nHydrogen has only one electron in its outer shell, making it highly reactive. The electron can easily form a covalent bond with other chemical elements. The Hydrogen atom is unique in that it has only one orbital around the nucleus, making it easy to calculate electron density around the atom.\n\nIsotopes of the Hydrogen Atom\n\nIsotopes are elements with the same atomic number but differ in the number of neutrons they have in their nucleus. Hydrogen has three isotopes \u2013 the protium, deuterium, and tritium. Protium is the most common hydrogen isotope, having one proton and no neutrons in its nucleus.\n\nDeuterium is a heavier, stable isotope of Hydrogen that has one neutron in its nucleus and makes up about 0.015% of naturally occurring hydrogen. It is used as a tracer in medical research and in the production of heavy water. Tritium, on the other hand, is radioactive and has two neutrons in its nucleus. It is used in nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons.\n\nChemical Reactions of the Hydrogen Atom\n\nThe Hydrogen atom is reactive, and it easily reacts with other chemical elements. Removal of the only electron in the hydrogen atom by ionization forms a positively charged hydrogen atom, which is called a proton because it has only a proton confined to the nucleus. Adding an electron to a neutral hydrogen atom forms a reactive species that is called a hydride.\n\nCovalent bonds between atoms and hydrogen do also exist. Hydrogen molecule can also form a bond with other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.\n\nPreparation of the Hydrogen Atom\n\nThe Hydrogen molecule can be prepared via various methods. It can be generated through the electrolysis of water or the electrochemical oxidation of Hydrogen gas. It can also be prepared from the dissolving of sodium metal in water, among other methods.\n\nHydrogen molecules can add across a double bond using a catalyst such as palladium or Pd. This reaction is called hydrogenation.\n\nHydrogen bonds\n\nHydrogen bonds are special type of electrostatic interaction that happens in polar molecules such as water. In a solution of pure water, each hydrogen atom in one molecule is attracted to an oxygen atom in adjacent molecules. This forms an organized network and gives rise to the unique properties of water.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo learn about the chemistry of the Hydrogen Atom may seem like a challenging concept, but it is an essential topic for anyone interested in the field of chemistry and physics. With this article, you now have an overview of the basics of the Hydrogen Atom, its isotopes, its chemical reactions, and much more. We hope this article was informative and has provided you with the knowledge and insight to understand the role of Hydrogen in the world of chemistry.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":246}

{"text":"  We find a novel confinement mechanism in the two-flavor dense quark matter\nproposed recently, that consists of the 2SC condensates and the $P$-wave\ndiquark condensates of $d$-quarks. This quark matter exhibiting color\nsuperconductivity as well as superfluidity is classified into two phases;\nconfined and deconfined phases of vortices. We establish that the criterion of\nthe confinement is color neutrality of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases: vortices\nexhibiting color non-singlet AB phases are confined by the so-called AB defects\nto form color-singlet bound states. In the deconfined phase, the most stable\nvortices are non-Abelian Alice strings, which are superfluid vortices with\nfractional circulation and non-Abelian color magnetic fluxes therein,\nexhibiting color non-singlet AB phases. On the other hand, in the confined\nphase, these non-Abelian vortices are confined to either a baryonic or mesonic\nbound state in which constituent vortices are connected by AB defects. The\nbaryonic bound state consists of three non-Abelian Alice strings with different\ncolor magnetic fluxes with the total flux canceled out connected by a domain\nwall junction, while the mesonic bound state consists of two non-Abelian Alice\nstrings with the same color magnetic fluxes connected by a single domain wall.\nInterestingly, the latter contains a color magnetic flux in its core, but this\ncan exist because of color neutrality of its AB phase.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109194}
{"text":"  The estimation of covariance matrices of multiple classes with limited\ntraining data is a difficult problem. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) is\nknown to perform poorly when the number of variables is large compared to the\navailable number of samples. In order to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of\nthe SCM, regularized (shrinkage) SCM estimators are often used. In this work,\nwe consider regularized SCM (RSCM) estimators for multiclass problems that\ncouple together two different target matrices for regularization: the pooled\n(average) SCM of the classes and the scaled identity matrix. Regularization\ntoward the pooled SCM is beneficial when the population covariances are\nsimilar, whereas regularization toward the identity matrix guarantees that the\nestimators are positive definite. We derive the MSE optimal tuning parameters\nfor the estimators as well as propose a method for their estimation under the\nassumption that the class populations follow (unspecified) elliptical\ndistributions with finite fourth-order moments. The MSE performance of the\nproposed coupled RSCMs are evaluated with simulations and in a regularized\ndiscriminant analysis (RDA) classification set-up on real data.

Network simulators such as ns-3 and OMNeT++ can provide\naccurate answers, but are very hard to parallelize, taking hours or days to\nanswer what if questions for a single configuration at even moderate scale.\nRecent work with MimicNet has shown how to use machine learning to improve\nsimulation performance, but at a cost of including a long training step per\nconfiguration, and with assumptions about workload and topology uniformity that\ntypically do not hold in practice.\n  We address this gap by developing a set of techniques to provide fast\nperformance estimates for large scale networks with general traffic matrices\nand topologies. A key step is to decompose the problem into a large number of\nparallel independent single-link simulations; we carefully combine these\nlink-level simulations to produce accurate estimates of end-to-end flow level\nperformance distributions for the entire network.

We used the Integrated Field Unit of the VIMOS\ninstrument at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory to\nstudy the morphology, kinematics, and metallicity employing line maps, velocity\nmaps, and line diagnostics of a few characteristic spectra. The line ratios of\ndifferent spectra vary, indicating highly structured HII regions, but define a\nlocus of uniform metallicity. The strong-line diagnostic diagrams and empirical\ncalibrations point to a nearly solar or even super-solar oxygen abundance. The\nvelocity dispersion of the gas is highest in the region offset from the bright\nclusters. Star formation may be active on a low level. There is evidence for a\nlarge-scale disk-like structure in the region of SH2, which would make the\nsimilar radial velocity of the nearby globular cluster easier to understand.\nThe high metallicity does not fit to a dwarf galaxy as progenitor.

{"text":"  Inside individual cells, expression of genes is stochastic across organisms\nranging from bacterial to human cells. A ubiquitous feature of stochastic\nexpression is burst-like synthesis of gene products, which drives considerable\nintercellular variability in protein levels across an isogenic cell population.\nOne common mechanism by which cells control such stochasticity is negative\nfeedback regulation, where a protein inhibits its own synthesis. For a single\ngene that is expressed in bursts, negative feedback can affect the burst\nfrequency or the burst size. In order to compare these feedback types, we study\na piecewise deterministic model for gene expression of a self-regulating gene.\nMathematically tractable steady-state protein distributions are derived and\nused to compare the noise suppression abilities of the two feedbacks.

Those\nfew satellites ($\\sim$7.8%) that remain bound to their hosts after a\npericentric passage are typically found close to their host centres.

Neural Comput. 14, 2002), including intrinsic white noise and analyzing\neffects of noise on the spontaneous activity of the nonlinear system, in order\nto account for the experimental results of Segev et al.. Analytically we can\ndistinguish different regimes of activity, depending from the model parameters.\nUsing analytical results as a guide line, we perform simulations of the\nnonlinear stochastic model in two different regimes, B and C. The Power\nSpectrum Density (PSD) of the activity and the Inter-Event-Interval (IEI)\ndistributions are computed, and compared with experimental results. In regime B\nthe network shows stochastic resonance phenomena and noise induces aperiodic\ncollective synchronous oscillations that mimic experimental observations at 0.5\nmM Ca concentration. In regime C the model shows spontaneous synchronous\nperiodic activity that mimic activity observed at 1 mM Ca concentration and the\nPSD shows two peaks at the 1st and 2nd harmonics in agreement with experiments\nat 1 mM Ca. Moreover (due to intrinsic noise and nonlinear activation function\neffects) the PSD shows a broad band peak at low frequency. This feature,\nobserved experimentally, does not find explanation in the previous models.\nBesides we identify parametric changes (namely increase of noise or decreasing\nof excitatory connections) that reproduces the fading of periodicity found\nexperimentally at long times, and we identify a way to discriminate between\nthose two possible effects measuring experimentally the low frequency PSD.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109230}

Recently, DETR3D introduces a novel 3D-2D query paradigm in\naggregating multi-view images for 3D object detection and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. In this paper, with intensive pilot experiments,\nwe quantify the objects located at different regions and find that the\n\"truncated instances\" (i.e., at the border regions of each image) are the main\nbottleneck hindering the performance of DETR3D. Although it merges multiple\nfeatures from two adjacent views in the overlapping regions, DETR3D still\nsuffers from insufficient feature aggregation, thus missing the chance to fully\nboost the detection performance.

{"text":"  Bayesian inverse problems often involve sampling posterior distributions on\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon\nmesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more\naccurate.

However, few of them take into account the geometry of the\nposterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric\nMCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated\ndistributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are\nin general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite\ndimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional\nsubspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective\nis to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the\ncomputational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla\npreconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas\nfrom geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic\nfinite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while\nretaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods\nin the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the\ncontext of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat\nconduction and incompressible flow control.

In\nthe proposed cluster routing, capsules produce vote clusters instead of\nindividual votes for next-layer capsules, and each vote cluster sends its\ncentroid to a next-layer capsule. Generally speaking, the next-layer capsule's\ninput is a weighted sum over the centroid of each vote cluster it receives.

The\nchemo-kinematic analysis reveals the presence of the bar; of an inner thin\ndisk; of a thick disk, and of a broad metallicity population, with a large\nvelocity dispersion, indicative of a pressure supported component. We find and\ncharacterize chemically and kinematically a group of counter-rotating stars,\nwhich could be the result of a gas-rich merger event or just the result of\nclumpy star formation during the earliest phases of the early disk, which\nmigrated into the bulge. Finally, based on the 6D information we assign stars a\nprobability value of being on a bar orbit and find that most of the stars with\nlarge bar orbit probabilities come from the innermost 3 kpcs. Even stars with a\nhigh probability of belonging to the bar show the chemical bimodality in the\n[$\\alpha$\/Fe] vs. [Fe\/H] diagram.

This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these\ntheories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be\nparticularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a\nsimple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,\nwhere we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.\nThe gaps can be considered as \"pressurized cracks\" by using Ken Johnson's idea\nof searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution\nis an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,\nand Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories\nusing the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on\nthe fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of\nnatural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for\nlarge fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a\nfull fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion.

CBIID is found to originate from the steady,\nnon-homogeneous solution of the governing system of equations. Similar to\nStokes drift induced by surface waves, CBIID also generates a compensating\nEulerian return flow to satisfy the no-flux lateral boundaries, e.g. the\nshoreline. CBIID increases with an increase in the particle's initial depth,\nbottom undulation's amplitude, and the strength of the alongshore current.\nAdditionally, CBIID near the free (bottom) surface increases (decreases) with\nan increase in bottom undulation's wavelength. Maximum CBIID is obtained for\nlong wavelength bottom topography that approximately makes $\\pi\/4$ angle with\nthe shoreline. Unlike Stokes drift, particle excursions due to\ncurrent-bathymetry interactions might not be small, hence analytical\nexpressions based on the small-excursion approximation could be inaccurate.

Method: We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to perform the observations. Results: We\ndetected 183 GHz water maser emission towards NGC 4945 with a peak flux density\nof ~3 Jy near the galactic systemic velocity. The emission spans a velocity\nrange of several hundred km\/s. We estimate an isotropic luminosity of > 1000\nLsun, classifying the emission as a megamaser. A comparison of the 183 GHz\nspectrum with that observed at 22 GHz suggests that 183 GHz emission also\narises from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) central engine. If the 183 GHz\nemission originates from the circumnuclear disk, then we estimate that a\nredshifted feature at 1084 km\/s in the spectrum should arise from a distance of\n0.022 pc from the supermassive black hole (1.6 x 10(5) Schwarzschild radii),\ni.e. closer than the water maser emission previously detected at 22 GHz.

The numerical\nscheme is then based on approximately realizing this iteration within\ndynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence to the\nexact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed\nwithin suitably tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering\noperator needs to be approximately applied to the current iterate within a\ntolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second, parameter dependent\nlinear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy of\nthe iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one\nhas to employ rigorous a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a\nDiscontinuous Petrov--Galerkin (DPG) scheme.

{"text":"  In this work we focus on two questions. One, we complement the machinary to\ncalculate geometric phases along adiabatic cycles as follows. The geometric\nphase is a line integral along an adiabatic cycle, and if the cycle encircles a\ndegeneracy point, the phase becomes non-trivial. If the cycle crosses the\ndegeneracy point the phase diverges. We construct quantities which are\nwell-defined when the path crosses the degeneracy point. We do this by\nconstructing a generalized Bargmann invariant, and noting that it can be\ninterpreted as a cumulant generating function, with the geometric phase being\nthe first cumulant. We show that particular ratios of cumulants remain finite\nfor cycles crossing a set of isolated degeneracy points. The cumulant ratios\ntake the form of the Binder cumulants known from the theory of finite size\nscaling in statistical mechanics (we name them geometric Binder cumulants).\nTwo, we show that the machinery developed can be applied to perform finite size\nscaling in the context of the modern theory of polarization. The geometric\nBinder cumulants are size independent at gap closure points or regions with\nclosed gap (Luttinger liquid). We demonstrate this by model calculations for a\none-dimensional topological model, several two-dimensional models, and a\none-dimensional correlated model. In the case of two dimensions we analyze to\ndifferent situations, one in which the Fermi surface is one-dimensional (a\nline), and two cases in which it is zero dimensional (Dirac points). For the\ngeometric Binder cumulants the gap closure points can be found by one\ndimensional scaling even in two dimensions. As a technical point we stress that\nonly certain finite difference approximations for the cumulants are applicable,\nsince not all approximation schemes are capable of extracting the size scaling\ninformation in the case of a closed gap system.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109326}

The key is\nto provide the model with a strong inductive bias to discover the compositional\nstructures of latent modes.

{"text":"  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is becoming an important research\nfield, due to its wide applications and the rapid development of computer\nvision technologies.

The\nchannel-spatial attention mechanisms, which focus on the discriminative\nchannels and regions simultaneously, have significantly improved the\nclassification performance. However, the existing attention modules are poorly\nguided since part-based detectors in the FGVC depend on the network learning\nability without the supervision of part annotations. As obtaining such part\nannotations is labor-intensive, some visual localization and explanation\nmethods, such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), can be\nutilized for supervising the attention mechanism. We propose a Grad-CAM guided\nchannel-spatial attention module for the FGVC, which employs the Grad-CAM to\nsupervise and constrain the attention weights by generating the coarse\nlocalization maps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three popular FGVC datasets, including\nCUB-$200$-$2011$, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets.

With the\nincreasing popularity of taxi requesting services such as Uber and Didi Chuxing\n(in China), we are able to collect large-scale taxi demand data continuously.\nHow to utilize such big data to improve the demand prediction is an interesting\nand critical real-world problem. Traditional demand prediction methods mostly\nrely on time series forecasting techniques, which fail to model the complex\nnon-linear spatial and temporal relations. Recent advances in deep learning\nhave shown superior performance on traditionally challenging tasks such as\nimage classification by learning the complex features and correlations from\nlarge-scale data.

However, recent experimental\nfindings are challenging the universality of this theoretical approach at\nfinite distances of relevance for nanoscale assembly. Here, we present a\ncombined analytical and numerical many-body study demonstrating that physical\nadsorption can be significantly enhanced at the nanoscale. Regardless of the\nband gap or the nature of the adsorbate specie, we find deviations from\nconventional LZK power laws that extend to separation distances of up to 10--20\nnanometers. Comparison with recent experimental observation of ultra\nlong-ranged vdW interactions in the delamination of graphene from a silicon\nsubstrate reveals qualitative agreement with the present theory.

Again in\nthe finite dimensional case we prove that every operator system has the\nk-lifting property in the sense that whenever $f:S -> A\/I$ is a unital and\ncompletely positive map, where A is a C*-algebra and I is an ideal, then $f$\npossess a unital k-positive lift on A, for every k. This property provides a\nnovel proof of a classical result of Smith and Ward on the preservation of\nmatricial numerical ranges of an operator.\n  The Kirchberg conjecture naturally falls into this context. We show that the\nKirchberg conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the five dimensional\nuniversal operator system generated by two contraction ($S_2$) has the double\ncommutant expectation property. In addition to this we give several equivalent\nstatements to this conjecture regarding the preservation of various nuclearity\nproperties under basic algebraic operations. We show that the Smith Ward\nproblem is equivalent to the statement that every three dimensional operator\nsystem has the lifting property (or exactness). If we suppose that both the\nKirchberg conjecture and the Smith Ward problem have an affirmative answer then\nthis implies that every three dimensional operator system is C*-nuclear.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109393}

We find that aside from introducing\ndissipation, the detection also renormalizes the coherent evolution of the\nSQD-qubit system. Basically, if the electron on the detector has time to probe\nthe qubit, then it also has time to fluctuate and thereby renormalize the\nsystem parameters. In particular, this induces torques on the qubit isospins,\nsimilar to the spin torque generated by the spintronic exchange field in\nnoncollinear spin-valve structures.

We also investigate the\ndescriptive richness of different models for defining pure scoring rules,\nproving how more rule-generation time gives more rules, proving that rationals\ngive more rules than do the natural numbers, and proving that some restrictions\npreviously thought to be \"w.l.o.g.\" in fact do lose generality.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109439}
{"text":"  Automatic image captioning has improved significantly over the last few\nyears, but the problem is far from being solved, with state of the art models\nstill often producing low quality captions when used in the wild. In this\npaper, we focus on the task of Quality Estimation (QE) for image captions,\nwhich attempts to model the caption quality from a human perspective and\nwithout access to ground-truth references, so that it can be applied at\nprediction time to detect low-quality captions produced on previously unseen\nimages. For this task, we develop a human evaluation process that collects\ncoarse-grained caption annotations from crowdsourced users, which is then used\nto collect a large scale dataset spanning more than 600k caption quality\nratings. We then carefully validate the quality of the collected ratings and\nestablish baseline models for this new QE task. Finally, we further collect\nfine-grained caption quality annotations from trained raters, and use them to\ndemonstrate that QE models trained over the coarse ratings can effectively\ndetect and filter out low-quality image captions, thereby improving the user\nexperience from captioning systems.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109440}
{"text":"  While the basic laws of physics seem time-reversal invariant, our\nunderstanding of the apparent irreversibility of the macroscopic world is well\ngrounded in the notion of entropy. Because astrophysics deals with the largest\nstructures in the Universe, one expects evidence there for the most pronounced\nentropic arrow of time. However, in recent theoretical astrophysics work it\nappears possible to identify constructs with time-reversal symmetry, which is\npuzzling in the large-scale realm especially because it involves the engines of\npowerful outflows in active galactic nuclei which deal with macroscopic\nconstituents such as accretion disks, magnetic fields, and black holes.\nNonetheless, the underlying theoretical structure from which this accreting\nblack hole framework emerges displays a time-symmetric harmonic behavior, a\nfeature reminiscent of basic and simple laws of physics. While we may expect\nsuch behavior for classical black holes due to their simplicity, manifestations\nof such symmetry on the scale of galaxies, instead, surprise. In fact, we\nidentify a parallel between the astrophysical tug-of-war between accretion\ndisks and jets in this model and the time symmetry-breaking of a simple\noverdamped harmonic oscillator. The validity of these theoretical ideas in\ncombination with this unexpected parallel suggests that black holes are more\ninfluential in astrophysics than currently recognized and that black hole\nastrophysics is a more fundamental discipline.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109441}
{"text":"  In a recent outburst which lasted for 260 days, the black hole candidate GRO\nJ1655-40 exhibited a behaviour similar to its last outburst observed almost\neight years ago. We analyze a total of 150 observational spells in 122 days of\ndata spreaded over the entire outburst phase of Feb. 2005 to Oct. 2005. From\nour study, a comprehensive understanding of the detailed behaviour of this\nblack hole candidate has emerged. Based on the degree of importance of the\nblack body and the power-law components we divide the entire episode in four\nspectral states, namely, hard, soft, very soft and intermediate. Quasi-Periodic\noscillations (QPOs) were found in two out of these four states, namely, in the\nhard and the intermediate states. In the hard state, at the rising phase of the\noutburst, QPO frequency ranged from 0.034 - 17.78Hz and the spectra was fitted\nby a disk black body, power-law and iron emission line at 6.2 - 6.5 keV. In the\nintermediate state, QPOs vary from 13.17Hz to 19.04Hz and the QPO frequency\nmodulation in this state was not significant. The spectra in this state are\nwell fitted by the disk black body and the power-law components. In the hard\nstate of the declining phase of the outburst, we found QPOs of decreasing\nfrequency from 13.14 Hz to 0.034 Hz. The spectra of this state were fitted by a\ndisk black body and power-law components, but in the initial few days a cooler\nComptonized component was required for a better fit. In the soft and very soft\nstates, the spectral states are mostly dominated by the strong disk black body\ncomponent.\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"arxiv","id":109442}
{"text":"Allergies can be a real hassle, affecting everything from your daily activities to your overall quality of life. Some allergies can be severe and can even lead to anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening condition. Whether you are dealing with mild or severe allergies, there are a number of ways you can treat and manage your symptoms. In this article, we'll cover everything from recognizing anaphylactic shock to preventing the buildup of allergens in your home.\n\nPart 1: Recognizing Anaphylactic Shock\nAnaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction that may happen suddenly and can be life-threatening. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue or throat, and a rapid heartbeat. If you think you or someone near you is experiencing anaphylactic shock, call emergency services immediately. \n\nIf you carry an epinephrine injector, use it immediately. This will provide temporary relief from symptoms until you can get medical attention.\n\nEven if you have injected yourself with epinephrine, it is important to still go to the doctor to receive further treatment and monitoring.\n\nPart 2: Identifying Common Allergens\nIdentifying common allergens is essential in the prevention and management of allergies. Common food allergens include peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and soy. Other allergens can include pollen, pet dander, and molds. \n\nMake an allergy appointment with your doctor to have an allergy test conducted. This test will determine exactly what allergens you are allergic to. Knowing the allergens will allow you to make lifestyle changes and take necessary precautions.\n\nPart 3: Treating Allergies\nThere are a number of ways to treat allergies, including natural remedies and medication.\n\nTry natural remedies such as drinking tea made from nettles or ginger. These herbs have anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the symptoms of allergies.\n\nOral antihistamines are the most common medication used to get relief from common symptoms like runny nose, hives or itching. If you have itchy, red, or swollen eyes an antihistamine eye drop could help soothe those symptoms.\n\nIf you have nasal congestion, try an antihistamine nasal spray. Mast cell stabilizers are another alternative to antihistamines and nasal sprays.\n\nIn cases when nasal and sinus congestion seems to be the most problematic, oral decongestants and nasal corticosteroids may help relieve the symptoms. Nasal decongestant sprays and drops provide immediate relief but should only be used for a short period.\n\nWhere allergies are severe, oral corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists may be prescribed. Desensitization therapy is another option and can be quite effective for severe allergies.\n\nPart 4: Preventing Allergies\nPrevention is the best approach when it comes to allergies. Reduce the buildup of allergens in your home by regularly cleaning, vacuuming, and washing bedding. \n\nMold can be a significant trigger, so it is important to take steps to prevent its growth. This can be done by keeping your home's humidity level between 30 and 50 percent and removing any sources of chronic moisture.\n\nFoodborne allergen sources such as nuts can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions. Avoid eating anything you are allergic to, even in small amounts.\n\nIf you have a bee or wasp nest near, in, or on your house, hire a professional to remove it. This will significantly decrease your chances of being stung.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, allergies can be a real pain but there are many treatment options available. Knowing your allergens and taking steps to reduce exposure is your best bet. With the right approach, you'll be able to manage your allergies and live a happy and healthy life.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikihow","id":260}

{"text":"The Finland Plot, also known as the \"Tanner Affair,\" was a political scandal that took place in Finland during the 1950s. The plot involved accusations that a group of individuals, including the Finnish Prime Minister, Juho Kusti Paasikivi, and his successor, Karl-August Fagerholm, worked with the Soviet Union to maintain their power and influence in the Finnish government. The allegations were first made public by the Finnish Ambassador to Sweden, Max Jakobson, in a series of articles published in the Swedish press in 1954. Jakobson claimed that Paasikivi and Fagerholm had made a secret deal with Soviet officials during the Moscow Conference in 1952, in which they agreed to follow pro-Soviet policies in exchange for Soviet support. The accusations sparked a public outcry in Finland, with many demanding an investigation into the matter. The Finnish Parliament established a commission to investigate the allegations, and over the next few months, the commission heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Jakobson, Paasikivi, and Fagerholm. In the end, the commission was unable to find any concrete evidence of a plot or conspiracy. However, the accusations had a significant impact on Finnish politics, damaging the reputations of Paasikivi and Fagerholm and contributing to a shift in Finnish foreign policy away from the Soviet Union. Today, the Finland Plot remains a controversial and divisive topic in Finnish politics and history. While some view it as a legitimate concern about Soviet influence in Finnish affairs, others see it as a politically motivated smear campaign against left-leaning politicians. Regardless of one's perspective, the Finland Plot serves as a reminder of the complex and often fraught relationship between Finland and its powerful neighbor to the east.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikipedia","id":67284}

The attack, carried out by two Islamist extremists, left three dead and 15 injured. The explosion took place just after evening prayers at the shrine. The two bombers, Devender Gupta and Sunil Joshi, planted bombs in the courtyard of the shrine. The bombs were placed in two separate bags, and both of them exploded in quick succession. The Ajmer Dargah bombing was one in a series of attacks carried out by Hindu right-wing extremists across India.

{"text":"The Vels were an American new wave band formed in Philadelphia in 1981. The group consisted of brothers Harry and Paul XL and bassist Chas Mastropaolo.[1] The band's early material drew influence from post-punk and new wave bands such as Joy Division, Depeche Mode, and The B-52's. Their debut single, \"Private World,\" was released in 1984 on Mercury Records and received moderate airplay on college radio stations. The band's second single, \"Look My Way,\" was released later that year and was featured in the film The Breakfast Club.[2] In 1985, The Vels released their only full-length album, Velocity, which was produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars. The album included the single \"Girl Most Likely To,\" which received some radio play but did not chart. Despite positive reviews for the album, The Vels were dropped by Mercury Records shortly after its release. After disbanding, Harry XL went on to work as a producer and engineer, working with artists such as Laurie Anderson and The Sugarcubes. Paul XL and Chas Mastropaolo went on to form the band Chalice, which released two albums in the mid-1990s. The Vels' influence can be heard in the music of later artists such as The Strokes and Interpol, as well as in the indie rock scene of the 2000s.[3] Although The Vels had a brief career, their music continues to be appreciated by fans of 1980s new wave and post-punk. The band's uncompromising attitude towards their music and their willingness to experiment with different genres have made them a cult favorite among fans of the era.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikipedia","id":67303}
{"text":"Polyarchy is the term used to describe a political system in which power is held by multiple individuals or groups. This term was first coined by the political scientist Robert Dahl in the 1970s, and it has since become an important concept in the study of comparative politics, particularly in the field of democratic theory. A polyarchy is characterized by a combination of democratic and non-democratic elements. On one hand, there is typically a high degree of political pluralism, meaning that there are multiple political parties, interest groups, and civil society organizations that are active and relatively free to express their views and influence policy decisions. At the same time, however, there may be certain institutional or social barriers that prevent certain groups or individuals from fully participating in the political process, such as discriminatory election laws or deep-seated social prejudices. Despite these limitations, polyarchies are often seen as preferable to other types of political systems, such as authoritarian regimes or one-party states, because they offer at least some measure of political freedom and accountability. Polyarchies can also serve as a useful stepping stone to a more fully-formed democracy, particularly in countries with a history of authoritarianism or instability. Some scholars have raised concerns about the limitations of polyarchies, arguing that they may not go far enough in guaranteeing political freedom and equality for all citizens. Others have suggested that the concept of polyarchy may be too broad and imprecise to provide a clear roadmap for democratic reform. Nonetheless, for many political scientists and advocates of democratic governance, the concept of polyarchy remains a valuable tool for understanding and promoting democratic principles and practices around the world.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikipedia","id":67304}
{"text":"Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672) was an English Puritan poet who is considered one of the first female poets to be published in colonial America. She was born in Northamptonshire, England and later moved to Massachusetts Bay Colony with her husband and family in 1630. Bradstreet became well-known for her poetry which often reflected her Puritan beliefs and experiences as a woman in the 17th century. Some of her most well-known works include \"To My Dear and Loving Husband,\" \"Upon the Burning of Our House,\" and \"The Prologue.\" Her poetry often explored themes of love, family, faith, and loss, and is often praised for its sincere and emotional tone. Despite being a woman in a male-dominated Puritan society, Bradstreet's poetry was well-received and respected. It was first published in 1650 in a collection titled \"The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America.\" The collection was hugely popular and went through several editions in Bradstreet's lifetime. Bradstreet's life was not without hardship, however. She lost her brother, father, and several of her children to illness, and her home and belongings were destroyed in a fire. Despite these tragedies, Bradstreet continued to write poetry and maintain her faith. In addition to her literary accomplishments, Bradstreet is also notable for her contributions to Puritan society. She was a devout and active member of her church community, and her writings often reflect her commitment to her faith. Today, Anne Bradstreet is remembered as a pioneer in American literature and a significant figure in Puritan history. Her poetry continues to be studied and appreciated for its emotional depth and its reflection of colonial life in early America.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"wikipedia","id":67305}

Its total area is 5 square miles. Heth Township is located along the Ohio River in Harrison County 8 miles north of Corydon, Indiana. It is bordered by Ewing Township on the east, Adams Township on the southeast, Ohio Township on the south, and Franklin County, Indiana, on the west and north. Perryville, a small census-designated place (CDP), is located in Heth Township. The area was named by former settler William Heth, who came from Kentucky. It is said that he was an adventurous man with a good sense of humor and he traveled the Ohio Valley looking for adventure. The first known pioneer in the area was Edward Howell, who settled in Heth Township in 1809. For many years, Heth Township was known for its thriving tobacco industry. During the Civil War, Heth Township was one of the first portions of Harrison County to join the cause of the Union. Heth Township is served by the North Harrison Community School Corporation.

{"text":" Prosopometamorphopsia is a rare and rarefied condition characterized by the individual's visual perception of other people's faces transforming into the faces of familiar figures, often beloved family members, friends and even animals. The condition has been termed \"Metamorphopsia of the Human Face\" and is often associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. It was first acknowledged by neurologist and psychiatrist Auguste Bouisson in 1878. People affected by prosopometamorphopsia often first notice the faces of loved ones, such as parents, siblings or children, morphing into the faces of different individuals as they look away from the person and back again. In some cases, the face will change instantaneously, or even switch back and forth between two or more individuals, such as a parent and a pet. In other cases, the transformation occurs slowly and with notable changes in the features seen in the face. The condition is not associated with visual hallucinations, as those affected by prosopometamorphopsia can clearly distinguish between the shifting faces and the actual person in question. It is more likely an issue with visual processing in the brain, as people with temporal lobe epilepsy often experience this issue. This is due to the way in which images and faces are processed, stored and retrieved in the brain, resulting in the misperception that someone's face has changed when it has not. Though prosopometamorphopsia is comparatively rare, it can have a serious impact on social situations. Those affected may become apprehensive of unfamiliar people or environments, as they fear seeing their faces transform. This fear can make socializing, attending social events and going outside difficult for those with the condition. Fortunately, medical professionals are beginning to address this condition. Various treatments are available, including medications, cognitive behavioral therapy and, where necessary, physical therapy. In addition, patients may benefit from support from family and friends, as well as group sessions with individuals who are also affected. Though prosopometamorphopsia remains relatively unknown, it is an increasingly recognised condition. As medical professionals become aware of the symptoms and impact it can have, those affected by it can receive the medical and emotional help they need to manage their condition.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67406}

{"text":" The 1888 Open Championship was the 28th Open Championship, held 14\u201315 June at Prestwick Golf Club in Prestwick, South of Scotland. The Championship was won by Jack Burns, who scored 167 to win the tournament by three shots over runner-up Willie Campbell. The event was the final Open Championship to be played over 36 holes, switching to 72 holes the following year. This tournament marks the first instance in any major tournament of two professional golfers playing as partners. The pairing of Willie Park Sr. and Mungo Park was a successful one, as they finished in third place with a score of 172. With an additional professional partner, John Ball, the team shot a far more respectable score of 168 for the two rounds. A total of 48 players entered the Championship, and the winner received a prize of \u00a310. The competition was divided into two divisions with the top sixteen players (selected according to their listed handicaps) competing in the first division and the remaining players competing in the second division. The course at Prestwick, a classic Scottish links course, was notorious for being a demanding test of golf. In the first round of play, the winds were gusty and combined with the deceptively difficult greens, which Jack Burns described as \u201clightning fast\u201d to putt on, the course proved to be a stern test. Burns and Campbell, who started the final round tied, broke away from the field with a score of 82 and 79, respectively, in the second round, with Burns shooting a consistent round of 81, 83 to take the title. The Scottish dominance of the Open Championship as well as golf in general was clear with the top four finishers all being Scottish. This dominance was due in part to the small field size as compared to other events and the fact that the event was not well known outside of Scotland at this time. This was Jack Burns\u2019 second and final victory in the Championship, having previously won in 1880. He is one of only two players to win the Championship twice, the other being Willie Park Sr.. The 1888 Open Championship was the final Open Championship to be held at Prestwick prior to the introduction of the Open Championship\u2019s rota system in 1895.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67408}
{"text":" Shruti (from Sanskrit \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u093f, meaning \"tone, sound\") is a concept in Indian classical music, referring to the smallest semitone of the raga or melody. It is an essential part of the musical system of India and is the basis for all melody and harmony in Indian music. Shruti refers to the microtones between melodic notes, which are notated using quarter-tone notation. In order to perform a given raga, musicians must be very well-versed in the structure and technique of using these microtones, which require a greater degree of accuracy than regular semitones. Indian instruments such as the sitar, tabla and veena are tuned to particular shrutis, which are very particular frequencies. Some Indian systems have 12 shrutis, based on the 12-semitone division of the octave. There are two categories of shrutis, Shuddha and Vikrut, or \"natural\" and \"altered.\" Shuddha shrutis are the pitches of the seven basic swaras of the Octave, while Vikrut shrutis are more finely tuned microtones that occur between the basic swaras. In Indian music, musicians use the shrutis to create a feeling of movement in the music, as well as to set a mood or create an atmosphere. In addition, the differences between various shrutis can be used to create a certain kind of tension. This is why they are so important to Indian classical music and why they play such a large role in Indian musical tradition. In recent years, shrutis have been used in western music as well, combining different musical genres. However, this is still a relatively novel concept and its usage is still in its early stages. Shruti is an ancient concept and it has been around for centuries. It is a fundamental part of Indian music, and it is important for musicians to understand and master the art of using shrutis in order to perform a given raga or melody in the most authentic way. This is why shrutis are so important to Indian music and have continued to be so for so long.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67409}

{"text":" African Sources for African History is an academic field devoted to the study and use of historical records from within Africa to research and study African history. The field has developed significantly and grown in importance in the past few decades, due to an increased focus on African scholarship and the recognition of African history as a legitimate area of study. African Sources for African History encompasses a wide range of historical records, such as oral traditions, written texts, archaeological artifacts, monuments, and even visual records, such as paintings and photographs. It is essential that historians in the field recognize the different nature of each type of evidence, as the manner in which evidence is interpreted and understood can vary between different types. Oral traditions, passed down through generations, are an important source of African history. These traditions often provide insight into pre-colonial Africa, before the development of westernized written records. Historians are aware, however, that over time, these oral traditions can become muddled and misinterpreted; due to this, utilizing oral traditions as an authoritative source of evidence is often met with criticism. In terms of written records, archival research of both European and African sources has played a significant role in the study of African history. Colonial archives, such as those from the British, Portuguese, French and Dutch empires, often provide evidence on events that occurred during the colonial period, but may present a Euro-centric or skewed perspective. African archival sources, such as local newspapers, church records, and published accounts from Africans, are also an important part of the research. In some cases, even correspondence between local rulers is useful. Additionally, African historians in the field can also use memoirs, contemporaneous travelers\u2019 accounts, oral accounts, and even court records as evidence. Archaeological records, such as tools, tools, jewelry, and pottery, provide evidence of the daily life and culture of pre-colonial Africa. Furthermore, monuments and architectural remains, such as ancient burial grounds, ruins of settlements and stone sculptures, are often studied to gain insight into the past. Visual records, such as photographs, paintings, and sketches, also provide evidence about African history and culture. Such records can often provide a glimpse into the past and show the many cultures that have existed in Africa over time. In conclusion, African Sources for African History is an important area of research and study, providing various records that shed light on Africa\u2019s past, present, and future. As historians in the field gain more experience and expertise in deciphering different historical sources, the accuracy and qualitative nature of research pertaining to African history will likely only improve.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67414}

{"text":" Old wave is a term coined in the late 2000s to describe the cultural wave of older music genres, specifically rock and metal. Many up-and-coming acts were attempting to recapture the sound of the old wave in a modern context. It is not to be confused with classic rock, which refers to a particular period in Rock and Roll which started in roughly the mid 60s and ended in roughly the early 80s. The revival of old wave genres started around 2005 when acts such as Steel Panther, Jet, Taking Back Sunday, The Darkness, and Franz Ferdinand began to gain popularity. These acts all had a tendency to take the classic, classic rock sound and lyrics and put them into a modern context by altering their instrumentation and production to fit the times. The new wave brought in a new audience who, after being saturated with processional pop music from the mid 90s onwards, sought to recover the musical \"edge\" that rock and metal had once possessed. Old wave has come to encompass a number of genres, including classic rock, hard rock, blues-rock, and metalcore. It can be heard in the sound of greats such as AC\/DC or Led Zeppelin, but also in the sound of more modern bands like Halestorm or Disturbed. Generally, it is characterized as having an intense, rock-inspired sound, with particular attention being paid to guitar tones, song structures, and vocal delivery. Old wave has had a resurgence in the last decade, and its influence can be seen in the styles of younger bands such as The Pretty Reckless, Halestorm, and Ghost. Due to its blend of classic rock and metal influences, the genre appealed to a wider audience who were looking for something familiar, yet modern. Additionally, many of the acts that were developing in the scene have since gone on to great success, making old wave a viable style in popular music. Though old wave has made a big comeback in recent years, it is still considered to be on the fringe of mainstream music, and for the most part stays confined to specialty radio programs and independent media outlets. Its deep grooves, its blues-based guitar riffs, and its classic metal sound continue to inspire young bands, and will likely be heard for many years to come.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67422}

{"text":" James Hodge Codding (October 18, 1869 - April 16, 1960) was an American minister who was ordained in the Presbyterian Church in 1892 and the most renowned Melanesian missionary. He was born in Verona, New York, and graduated from Hobart College in 1891. After traveling and teaching in the Melanesian Archipelago, he became superintendent and director of the London Missionary Society's South Seas evangelistic enterprise in 1902. He is credited with establishing the foundation for one of the largest and most successful missions in that region. Codding was sent to the South Seas by the London Missionary Society in 1895, where he spent the rest of his life working to bring the Gospel to the heathen over an immense range of islands known as Melanesia. During the span of his ministry in the region he planted over 160 churches and ordained 430 native pastors. He recorded more than one thousand names on his family register. The custom of head-hunting, common among the islanders at the time of Codding's arrival, was replaced by Christian worship services during his time there. He also popularized the phrase \"sons of Solomon\", which became the nickname of the islanders. In recognition of his missionary spirit, Codding was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the University of Edinburgh in 1926 and the Order of the British Empire in 1928. In addition to his Christian message, Codding was a great social reformer and wrote numerous books and articles on Melanesian society. He wrote largely of his trials and tribulations as a missionary and his experiences in the \"island world\" as a form of cultural documentation. His works include: \"Things Seen in the South Seas\" and \"Light in the Islands\". Codding returned to California shortly before his death and is interred in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. He had been a lifelong friend of the Roosevelt family, who attended his funeral. After his death, his widow, Ethel, hired a sculptor to create a bronze statue of Codding in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Codding is remembered today for his pioneering work in the South Seas. He helped to bring the Gospel to the regions of the Pacific islands, establishing educational and medical facilities, building churches and helping to reform island culture. His impact on the region can still be seen today in the islanders\u2019 reverence for Christianity and the deep religious faith they practice. Codding will always be remembered as a great missionary, whose life and work left an indelible mark in the islands he visited.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67424}

While at college he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Alpha Mu. His initial career was as a music teacher, but from 1940 onwards, he was increasingly involved in research and archival work. In 1942, Lowens began working for the American Jewish Committee, first as a research secretary and later as a librarian and musical director for the Committee's concerts. During his time there, he worked to collect, preserve, and promote Yiddish and Hebrew music, including conductors such as the violinist Norbert Abner Glantz, the composer Yossele Rosenblatt, and the cantor America's first notable Cantor, Joseph Rosenblatt. But Lowens' involvement went beyond the realm of music. He had a strong interest in the early history of American Jews, particularly the so-called \"hidden Jews\" who lived in colonial America and were unaware of their Jewish identity.

{"text":" Albertanus of Brescia (ca. 1150 AD \u2013 1225 AD) is a philosopher, theologian, poet, and theologian active during the 12th and 13th centuries, in the region of Lombardy, now part of northern Italy. He is most notable as the first to attempt to introduce the Aristotelian philosophy into the spiritual disciplines of Christianity. He was born into a relatively wealthy family in Brescia and spent his early adulthood in Lombardy. His primary education was in the Latin language and rhetoric. As a young man, he visited Paris, where he was exposed to the thought of the Arabic Latin authors of the twelfth century, such as Adelard of Bath, Peter of Spain, and John of Salisbury. It was through these authors that Albertanus was to learn about Aristotelian philosophy, for it was his belief that Aristotelian method could form the foundation of a theological system in harmony with the teachings of Christianity. After Paris, Albertanus travelled to the University of Padua, a veritable center of Aristotelian thought. It was here that he wrote his primary work, the Liber Paradoxorum, a book comprised of 274 maxims and paradoxes, many of them bearing a relationship to the Christian faith. Although his understanding of Aristotle may have been limited, what Albertanus did was lay the groundwork for future scholastic theologians and philosophers to embrace the works of the ancient philosopher. During the time of Albertanus, there were many forces in the Catholic Church that sought to reject the Aristotelian philosophy because it was viewed to be in opposition to the Christian faith. Therefore, the Church laid down harsh censures and sanctions upon any branch of intelligentsia that might align itself with the works of Aristotle. As a result, Albertanus lived under the fear of excommunication for much of his life. Nevertheless, he continued to use his knowledge of the philosopher for both religious and ethical interpretations. In 1222, John of Montecorvino, the first Franciscan missionary to the Far East, deemed him \"the wise man of Brescia.\" After his death in 1225, Albertanus of Brescia was widely accorded much respect within the Church and one can especially find his influence in the sermons of Quodvultdeus, a Roman Catholic bishop. In addition, he is influential throughout Europe, especially amongst the scientists and philosophers of the Scholastic period. Today, the legacy of Albertanus of Brescia is still remembered, especially in Lombardy, where there are many statues and memorials that honor his life and work. Similarly, there is an annual celebration known as the \u201cFesta di Albertano.\u201d A modern statue of him is located in the main square of Brescia. Albertanus of Brescia, who had the courage to introduce Aristotelian thinking into a world of religious tradition and beliefs, stands as a symbol of courage and fortitude in the face of adversity. He is remembered as an individual who managed to rise above the constraints of his time and still contribute to the philosophical and theological development of the Middle Ages.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67426}

It details the story of Michael Beard, a Nobel laureate physicist, who is struggling to stay relevant in a rapidly changing scientific climate. The novel explores Beard's life, relationships and circumstances as he embarks upon a journey of self-discovery. It covers his marital woes, his attempts at a mid-life career rejuvenation through an ambitious global warming project, and ultimately his moral dilemma between self-interest and ethical responsibility. The novel opens with an account of Beard's life in his 40s and recent past. He is married for the fifth time to a woman substantially younger than him. He is an acclaimed physicist and Nobel Laureate, but his reputation is beginning to dwindle as his research has become seemingly formulaic and unimaginative. Beard seeks to gain back some of his past success with an ambitious new project - applying quantum physics to global warming solutions. His research takes him to a remote island in the Arctic and as he applies his theories to the project, he finds himself in a deep moral quandary. His research demands compromise, compromise that proves too much for his moral compass. Soon, he finds himself trapped in a web of secrets and lies and a world of moral gray areas. The moral choices he makes have personal, professional and global implications. The novel has been praised for its attention to detail, the complexity of Beard's character and the masterful way in which McEwan weaves in current scientific theory with Beeard's personal journey. Solar is a thought-provoking and timely novel. It succeeds in elevating the global warming crisis and its personal and ethical implications from the realm of political discourse and into the human experience.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67429}

{"text":" Moonhole is a unique community located on the Caribbean island of Bequia in the Grenadine chain of islands. The innovative style of housing and community design was pioneered by the American architect Dr. Tom Johnson and his late wife\/partner, Swedish artist and activist Claire Johnson. Moonhole is a one of a kind development with an ethically inspired ethos that calls for sustainable living and minimum footprint on the pristine landscape of Bequia. The Johnson\u2019s vision articulated perfectly in the philosophy of their creation: \u201cWe are not taking from the peaceful island, we are just living in it\u201d. Moonhole consists of approximately 10 private homes, including the Johnson\u2019s own personal residence. Containing no straight angles of any kind, the homes were all handmade and carved from the existing coastline\u2019s volcanic rocks, coral, and soft shale, with natural oils and sun-dried in the baking Bequia heat. The dwellings of Moonhole were designed by the Johnson\u2019s with two key goals in mind, to create a minimal environmental footprint, and to allow nature\u2019s wildlife to move through without confrontation. The homes are constructed in such a way that all surfaces slope downward, resulting in the adjacent coral reef becoming the roof and the pillars of the house which maximizes the low-disturbance natural building process. The vision of Moonhole aims to bring together all the virtues and principles of sustainable living with respect and in harmony with the environment. This concept is supported by the fact that Moonhole currently has no roads, no electricity and no phone lines, with guests and community members having to fly themselves to the island via private plane. In terms of architecture, Moonhole has no equal, in harmony with it\u2019s enchanting surroundings it stands out as a beacon for sustainable innovation. Dr. Tom and Claire Johnson strove to create a utopian refuge that would showcase their pioneering beliefs, and the development at Moonhole is a living tribute to their mission and dedication.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67432}
{"text":" William Farren Jr. (1813 - 1886) was an English actor and theatre manager best known for his involvement in several productions of plays by William Shakespeare. Born in London, Farren was the son of the prominent actor, William Farren Sr. and his second wife, Catherine Milbourne, who was also an actress. Farren made his theatrical debut at the age of eleven in Dublin, Ireland, where his father was performing a run of Shakespeare plays. After training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, Farren gained his first professional role in 1832 at the Theatre Royal, Dublin. Farren had considerable success on the stage in Britain and enjoyed a long career in the theatre. He appeared in a variety of roles, but is most noted for his portrayals of Shakespearean characters such as Hamlet, Iago in Othello and Malvolio in Twelfth Night. He also played smaller roles in farces and burlesques. In 1848, Farren set up his own theatre company, purchasing the lease of the Queen's Theatre, Haymarket, which he managed for five years. This venture was moderately successful and he staged a number of popular productions, including several plays by Shakespeare. In particular, Farren's popular production of The Tempest in 1849 is still regarded as being one of the best performances of that play. In addition to his stage career, Farren was also a prominent figure in the Staranciers or private theatrical clubs of the Victorian era. These clubs encouraged amateur dramatics and provided an opportunity for well-to-do Londoners to enjoy theatricals in private. At the same time, Farren acted as a mentor to many of the young performers. Farren retired from the stage in 1871 and went to live in Eastbourne in Sussex. He died at his home there in 1886 and was buried in St Nicholas's Churchyard, Brighton. He left behind a number of works including a three-volume autobiography which sheds light on his remarkable career. Despite his long career, Farren is today remembered mainly for his association with the production of Shakespeare plays, of which he was a great admirer.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67433}

He focused on modernist book designs, logos, labels, and posters and soon became a leader in the Dutch graphic design industry. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Schuitema designed many logos and posters, which embodied his distinct style of abstract shapes, basic geometric forms, limited colours, and sans-serif typefaces. He is best known for his \"DAF\" logo, which he designed in 1933 for the Dutch automaker's first car. His logo for the Departement of Social Affairs consisted of three bars in black, yellow and blue and became widely utilized throughout the Netherlands. He also created a logo for the Dutch Civil Aviation Authority, which featured an airplane and horizontally striped wings, as well as a logo for Air France, which combined two short horizontal lines and an 'A' in the centre. In addition to playing a major role in influencing American and International design firms, Schuitema's work was integral in launching the modernist movement in Dutch graphic design. He was named the president of the Council for Art and Industry, which sought to promote modern art, design and architecture. In the 1950s, Schuitema was a major figure in the Amsterdam Art Group, an organization devoted to the promotion of graphic design and its role in visual communication. Schuitema's legacy has been widely celebrated and in 2006 he was inducted into the Dutch Hall of Fame for Graphic Designers.

{"text":" Schizopygopsis is a genus of cyprinid fish that are native to Central and East Asia, from Bhutan and Nepal to the Amur Basin in eastern Russia and northern China. The genus contains over twenty species, most of which inhabit upland rivers and streams with cool to cold water environments. Some species may also enter waters around lakes and the edges of wetlands. The majority of Schizopygopsis species are medium-sized, with adults growing up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in length. They can be identified by their streamlined and laterally compressed bodies, featuring large eyes, powerful jaws and teeth, as well as muscular dorsal and caudal fins. Whilst adults of the species display a gray-brown coloration dorsally, most species also exhibit a distinct color pattern on the sides and belly, often with patterns of blue, green and red. The diet of Schizopygopsis consists mainly of aquatic insects such as midge larvae, crustaceans, and the larvae and eggs of other fish. In turn, the adults and juveniles of Schizopygopsis are consumed by a variety of predators, such as herons and hawks, as well as other fish. Schizopygopsis species may also occasionally enter into spawning migrations. For example, the Schizothorax richardsonii may migrate up to 40 km (25 miles) from their year-round habitats in isolated rivers to reach the tributaries of large lakes. When spawning, adults of this species may form dense aggregations. Upon hatching, larvae of most species drift downstream until they reach nursery habitats of shallower, warmer waters. Like many species of cyprinids, Schizopygopsis species are an important food source for local populations and are widely fished. Thus, there is intense pressure on these species, particularly in areas where capture limits are not regulated. As Schwizopygopsis inhabit relatively narrow ranges, they are susceptible to habitat changes that can affect their limited populations and also increase the risks of overfishing. Therefore, it is widely recommended that management plans be established to conserve these populations. Management plans should include provisions for setting appropriate catch limits and protecting their habitats from both chemical and physical disturbance. Furthermore, research should be conducted to better understand the ecology of these species and the effects of various environmental changes.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67440}

It is a light, yet muscular breed, known for its intelligence and athleticism. The breed is primarily used for racing and polo in the region, but it is also gaining popularity as a show jumper or dressage horse. The Hequ is a relatively small horse standing between 14-16 hands, with a convex profile and a straight or slightly convex neck. Its head is small, with a broad forehead and large, bright eyes. Its back is strong and of medium length and its limbs are well-proportioned with large joints and thick hooves. The coat is typically bay, chestnut or gray, although there are also some roans and pinto color variations. The Hequ has a good temperament, alertness and a strong work ethic. The Hequ was developed in the Hequ region, which can trace its equine history to much earlier times. Horses were an essential part of everyday life in the area, and were used for transportation, herding, military purposes and even sport. The Hequ was bred to be able to stand up to the cold climate and rugged terrain of the region, and to be fast enough for racing, as well as being able to endure long days of work. Hequs are particularly popular for polo in the region and are also gaining recognition in show jumping and dressage events, where they have proved to be both agile and compliant. Despite their small size, they are strong and well-muscled, which is a great advantage when asked to perform complex movements at higher speeds. The Hequ is still relatively rare outside the region, but recent efforts have been made to promote the breed, and it is becoming increasingly popular for competitive sports. The ideal Hequ should exhibit boldness and agility, as well as an even temperament, and these qualities are being sought after as the breed grows in popularity.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"wikipedia","id":67445}

{"text":" Flags of Norwegian subdivisions refers to the various flags which are specifically used to represent the Norwegian subnational entities of the country. Norwegian subnational entities consist of the country's 19 administrative regions and 430 municipalities. The majority of these flags, especially for the administrative regions, belong to the Nordic Cross style. The usage of flags for the Norwegian subnational entities started off with simple banners, emblems and logos. As the usage of flags began to slowly spread, more advanced designs were adopted with intricate symbols and colours. The current flags used for the administrative regions all consist of the Nordic Cross style pattern. The colours used in these flags are inspired by the national colours of Norway, while the symbols normally depict regional characteristics, such as mountains and other local features. The Norwegian Flag Law of 1980 established a set of regulations and guidelines for the use of flags for the municipalities in Norway. It required municipalities to register any flag designs with the police before being allowed to use it officially. According to the law, all municipal flags must have the municipality's name written below the Nordic Cross style and the colours must not clash with those used in the country's flag. Additionally, a municipal banner can only be used officially if it has been approved by the municipality. The law also placed several restrictions in the context of the use of banners, including the banning of any religious symbols. This resulted in the banning of the flags of traditional Norwegian Sami communities as they normally include symbols of Norse paganism. Despite being guided by the same regulations and having similar design styles, each municipality's flag is unique to its particular area. The range of elements differ depending on the region, with some showing the country's national colours along with their own and others displaying specific patterns, such as criss-crossed lines. Today, flags of Norwegian subnational entities are used in a variety of settings such as on front doors, car windows and public buildings. They represent the country's diverse regions and provide a visual representation of Norwegian identity and culture. References 1.

{"text":" If you want a boy to like you, then he should see that you\u2019re a fun girl to be around. You don\u2019t want him to think that you\u2019re one of those people who always depends on other people for fun, or who stands around with a frown on her face, worrying or just feeling cranky. Instead, you want him to notice you and to think, \u201cHey, that girl is always laughing or having fun. I should try to meet her.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be fake \u2013 you should just aim to be the kind of person who is always having a great time, no matter what.\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you should put a fake smile on your face if you\u2019re really not feeling it. However, you should try to cultivate a positive attitude by focusing on the things that make you happy in conversation, instead of complaining about every little thing that goes wrong.\nEven if you\u2019re by yourself or about to take a math test, try to look on the bright side and to keep a smile on your face. Not every moment of your life will be a sheer joy, but you can think about something that you\u2019re looking forward to later when you\u2019re struggling to stay positive.\nIf you\u2019re just walking to class by yourself, you don\u2019t need to do it with a dopey grin on your face, but you should avoid frowning, looking bored as you search through your cell phone, or generally looking disengaged. If you avoid distractions and stare ahead with a happy, or at least neutral look on your face, then the boy is more likely to notice you.;\n, When it comes to showing that you\u2019re confident, body language is half the battle. You should walk with straight posture and avoid slouching, whether you\u2019re sitting down or standing up. Keep your arms at your sides instead of folded over your chest so that you look approachable. Look straight ahead if you\u2019re alone, or make eye contact if you\u2019re talking to people, instead of looking at the floor. Though you may not always feel confident, showing confidence with your body language can go a long way in making you feel more secure.\n\n\nAnother way to have confident body language is to avoid fidgeting as much as you can. Try to avoid biting your nails, playing with the bottom of your shirt or your hair, or anything else that will make you look nervous.\nWhen you\u2019re standing in a group of people, try to stand tall instead of shrinking back so you get noticed and feel comfortable.\n\n, You may be feeling shy when it comes to the boy you like, but a small, sweet smile can go a long way in making the boy notice you. All you have to do is smile at the boy when you make eye contact, and this will instantly make you look more friendly and approachable. You shouldn\u2019t try to catch his eye and smile at him every single time, but you should make an effort to smile at him if you lock eyes and it feels right. You should especially do this if you both pass each other in the halls, just to be friendly.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling shy about this, you can give him a quick smile and then look away. You don\u2019t have to look too eager \u2013 the goal is to look friendly and approachable so he notices you and wants to get to know who you are.\n\n, To get a boy to notice you, you should let him see what makes you different. You don\u2019t have to show off or hog all the attention to do this, either. If you love fashion, then let him see your latest homemade necklace or unique dress. If you like soccer, then talk about how much the sport means to you, or even invite him to watch you play. If you\u2019re known for your sense of humor, then crack some jokes in his company. Your goal is to make him see that there\u2019s something special about you, which will make him want to get to know you more.\n\n\nAvoid bragging about the things you\u2019re good at. Instead, just talk about how much you love to paint, write poetry, do gymnastics, or pursue one of your other hobbies, and he\u2019ll see that you\u2019re passionate about it.\nDon\u2019t stand out just for the sake of standing out. Dying your hair pink isn\u2019t a good idea if all you want to do is to get his attention; however, if you really do want pink hair, then go for it! Remember that if you\u2019re doing something just for the sake of attention, he will be able to tell.\n\n, At your school, it can be pretty common for you to ask your friends to talk to the boy you like for you. You may ask them to ask him if he likes you, or just to run up and talk to him for you. However, if you want to impress the boy and get him to really notice you, then you shouldn\u2019t get your friends to do the hard work for you. Show that you\u2019re more mature than a lot of girls your age and that you\u2019re comfortable enough to talk to the boy yourself.\n\n\nWhether you want to say hi or even feel ready to tell him you like him, you should talk to him on your own. He\u2019ll be impressed by this and will want to get to know you.\nHaving your friends write notes to the boy, or even writing them yourself, also makes it look like you\u2019re afraid to talk to him yourself. Instead, just take a deep breath and talk to him face to face.\n\n, Boys can be really impressed by girls who know who they are and who are happy with themselves. Though developing true confidence can take a lifetime, you can make an effort to love yourself and your life, so that you can use that energy to make others feel good about themselves, too. If you want to get a boy to notice you, then he should see you smiling, feeling good about yourself, and giving off a positive, satisfied energy. Here are some other ways to impress the boy you like with your confidence:\n\n\nDon\u2019t put yourself down in front of him. Instead, focus on the good aspects of yourself \u2013 without bragging. Being down on yourself just puts the boy in an awkward position, and you want him to feel comfortable, and to not feel like you need him there to feel good about yourself.\nIt\u2019s okay if you\u2019re feeling a little nervous about talking to him. If you stutter, forget what you were going to say, or find yourself rambling on about nothing, make sure you\u2019re able to laugh at yourself a little and to brush it off. It\u2019s okay if he doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re the smoothest person in the world; what\u2019s important is that he sees that you\u2019re comfortable with yourself.\nWhen you talk about other girls, stick to the things you like about them. Nothing will make you look insecure faster than putting down other girls.\n\n, Don\u2019t think that you should be a Mean Girl or to make other people look stupid just to get the boy\u2019s attention. If he\u2019s a good guy, then he\u2019ll be much more impressed by the fact that you\u2019re a nice person than if you\u2019re putting other people down or giving people the cold shoulder just to look cool. Instead, work on being friendly to any person who is nice to you, or even to someone who is a little shy; give people the benefit of the doubt until they prove that they\u2019re not worth it. If you\u2019re a generally nice person, then the boy will be more likely to know who you are, and to want to get to know you.\n\n\nEveryone has a reputation to uphold. If you\u2019re known for being a snob, then the boy will hear about it. Instead, be genuinely nice to people so you\u2019re open to more friendships and experiences. You don\u2019t have to be super outgoing to do this, either. Just saying hi to people and asking how their day is going can go a long way in helping you make friends and to come off like a nice person.\nIf you hang out in circles where girls tend to gossip a lot of to be mean to each other, then ask yourself if it\u2019s time for a friend spring-cleaning. Even if you\u2019re not the one being mean, it\u2019s no fun to be associated with people who are being cruel.\n\n, If you want the boy to like you, then it\u2019s not all about making him think that you\u2019re a fascinating, awesome person. You have to show that you\u2019re interested in him, too. To do this, you have to ask him a few questions about his life to keep him interested and to show that you\u2019re more than just a pretty face. Make sure there\u2019s a balance in the conversation between talking about yourself and asking him questions, and he\u2019ll see that he likes talking to you a lot. Here are some questions you can ask him about:\n\n\nWhat he did over the weekend\nHis plans for the summer or upcoming holidays\nHis pets\nHis favorite bands, TV shows, movies, or books\nHis hobbies and interests\n\n, Another way to keep the boy interested is to not overwhelm him by coming on too strong. You can compliment him and make it pretty clear that you like him if he shares your interests, but you shouldn\u2019t glue yourself to him or constantly spend time with him. Give him time to miss you, to wonder what you\u2019re doing, and to appreciate that you have your own life. If you make your life all about him, then he\u2019ll lose interest pretty soon. You don\u2019t want him to think that you\u2019re too intense. Even if you really, really like him, you should wait for the relationship to deepen before you share your true feelings.\n\n\nOne way to avoid coming on too strong is to avoid texting him or checking in on him all the time. You can check in with him to say hi, but don\u2019t make it seem like all you do is think about him when you\u2019re not together.\n\n, If you want to hold a guy\u2019s interest, then you have to make him feel like he\u2019s special to you \u2013 without coming on too strong, of course. If he starts treating you like you\u2019re special to him, then you should do the same, by paying a bit more attention to him in groups, asking him how he\u2019s doing, or even giving him a subtle complement about his clothes or something that isn\u2019t overly personal. If you want to keep the boy around, then he has to know that you care for him. You don\u2019t have to come right out and say it, but you can let your actions show that you care for him.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a group, pay more attention to him than the other boys, but don\u2019t stick by his side the whole time. He should take the first step and come to you, sometimes.\nDon\u2019t give him the same compliments you might give someone else. Let him see that he really does stand out to you.\n\n, Another way to hold a boy\u2019s interest is to find some common ground. You probably don\u2019t have everything in common, but having just a few things to talk about can help you relate to each other and keep the conversation going. Don\u2019t worry if you feel like you\u2019re really different people and you have nothing to talk about; once you relax a bit and keep the conversation moving forward, you\u2019ll find that you have more in common than you thought. Here are some common bonds you may find, which will give you a lot to talk about:\n\n\nA favorite sports team\nA favorite TV show or movie\nA favorite band\nFavorite video games\nPets\nFriends in common\nFavorite hobbies\n\n, Another way you can hold the boy\u2019s interest is to be a good listener. When he talks to you, put away your phone or any other distractions that would keep you from hearing him out. Let him finish what he has to say before interrupting. Don\u2019t tell him that you know exactly how he feels any time he shares an emotion with you. Show that you really care about who he is and what he has to say instead of talking about yourself the whole time. Just make eye contact, turn your body toward the boy, and give him all of your attention to show that you care.\n\n\nRemember that it should work both ways; you should listen to him just as much as he listens to you.\nPay attention to what he tells you so you can follow up about it later. If he tells you he has a big baseball game this weekend, for example, you can ask him how it went on Monday. This shows that you\u2019re keeping track of the things that he tells you and that it means something to you.\n\n, If you want the boy to continue to be interested in you, then you should avoid gossiping or saying bad things about the people you both know, or you will give off the wrong impression. If you\u2019re always gossiping about other girls, then he\u2019ll think that you\u2019re mean and that you don\u2019t care about other people. He\u2019ll also sense that you\u2019re insecure and may think that you like to put people down just to feel better about yourself. You should avoid being that girl and talk about the things you like, or the things you\u2019re looking forward to instead.\n\n\nIf other people around you are gossiping, just excuse yourself or even offer a different opinion. You don\u2019t want to look like a follower.\nBoys tend to hate drama. If you gossip in front of the boy, he\u2019ll think that you\u2019re the kind of girl who likes to bring on the drama, and he most likely will want to back off.\n\n, Though you\u2019re only in the fifth grade, which means that most people haven\u2019t kissed or done anything else yet, some boys will be ready to move further than you want. You should only kiss boys when you\u2019re ready, and you should never do it just because you think it\u2019ll keep a boy interested. If the guy you like is the type of person who will only like you if you kiss him, then he\u2019s not worthy of your time. Make sure that you feel completely comfortable before you do anything with a boy, and that you do it because you want to, not because you feel pressure. The real way to keep a boy interested is to be firm in your convictions and to stick to what you know is right.\n\n\nIf a boy is pressuring you to do something before you\u2019re ready, calmly tell him that you\u2019re just not interested. Hold your head high and don\u2019t let him get to you. You\u2019ll feel much better in the long run.\n\n, Guys in fifth grade don\u2019t tend to take life too seriously; they just want a girl they can have fun with. They\u2019re not quite at the age when they want to spend all of their time alone with a girl, and they\u2019re not really ready for intense relationships. Instead, they want girls who are lighthearted, who have fun friends, and who are spontaneous and up for trying something new. If you like to worry or are more quiet by nature, then that\u2019s fine; you can\u2019t change yourself, but you can work on keeping up more fun, lively conversation, and cutting down on the negativity and complaints, if you do that.\n\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be hard for you to burst into laughter. Don\u2019t hold back if something is funny and show that you\u2019re really having a great time.\nOne way to be a fun person is to know how to make people feel at ease. Make eye contact with people, ask them easy questions about themselves, and introduce them to each other if they don\u2019t know each other. Make them feel at home, and they\u2019ll be more relaxed and more likely to have fun.\n\n, If you want the boy to like you for a long time, or even for him to ask you out and date you, then you have to make an effort to be nice to his friends. Though it can be hard to be nice to his group of friends, especially if you really don\u2019t know any of them or if you\u2019re just a naturally shy person, you have to try as hard as you can to make a positive impression on the people that matter to him. If his friends think you\u2019re mean to them, too controlling, or just plain annoying, then they\u2019ll let him know how they feel and may be able to influence him. Unless they\u2019re really mean people, you should stay on their good sides and show them what a great catch you are.\n\n\nIf his friends are jerks, then you don\u2019t have to entertain them just for the sake of impressing him. But if they\u2019re nice guys, then you should try to be nice, too, even if you don\u2019t have all that much in common.\nDon\u2019t be frustrated if this takes a bit of work. It's only natural that a lot of girls and guys aren\u2019t super comfortable with talking to each other yet.\n\n, If you want to keep things interesting, then you have to continue to do your thing. Don\u2019t stop talking to your friends, spending time with your family, going to swim meets, or doing the things you love to do just because you\u2019re suddenly spending time with your crush. While you should make time for him so that your relationship can grow, you shouldn\u2019t give up everything you care about for the sake of a boy. He\u2019ll respect you more because he\u2019ll see that you\u2019re okay with doing your own thing while maintaining a relationship.\n\n\nYour friends will always be there for you, no matter what, while it can be a different story when it comes to guys. Don\u2019t be the girl who drops her friends to hang out with a boy and then has to come crawling back to them when the relationship is over.\nDoing the things you love to do, from playing piano to drawing, makes you who you are. If you stop doing those things for a boy, then you\u2019re giving up a part of yourself.\nIf you and the boy really like spending time together, then you can include him in some of your favorite interests, such as watching a show you like together.\n\n, If you want the relationship to thrive, then you should check in to say hi to the boy from time to time when you\u2019re apart. This could be when you\u2019re apart for a few weeks because of summer vacation, or just when you\u2019re apart for a weekend during school. You shouldn\u2019t contact him every five seconds, or even every day, but just a quick text, Facebook message, or even a phone call will let him know that he\u2019s still on your mind. Make sure that he returns your feelings and also gets in touch with you when you do this, so that there\u2019s a balance in your relationship.\n\n\nIf he told you he has a big basketball tournament this weekend, send him a quick text the next day to see how it went. But don\u2019t try to text him right before the game or he\u2019ll feel a bit overwhelmed.\nThis is where playing hard to get comes in. You want to check in enough to show that you care, but not so much that he thinks you\u2019re spending a lot of time thinking about him.\n\n, At the end of the day, you have to remember that you\u2019re only in the fifth grade, and that the chances that the boy you like is your soul mate and that you\u2019ll be together forever \u2013 or even for a few months \u2013 are pretty low, so you shouldn\u2019t bank too much on your relationship. If he\u2019s not interested, then just smile, catch your breath, and prepare for the next boy who will come your way. And if he\u2019s interested but things aren\u2019t working out the way you planned, then you shouldn\u2019t be too disappointed. The important thing is that you enjoy your time at school and your friendships, and that you get something out of the relationship. As far as dating goes, you have a lifetime of boys ahead of you!\n\n\nThe more relaxed you are about getting a boy to like you, the happier you\u2019ll feel because you won\u2019t be putting pressure on yourself. It\u2019s important to enjoy your life instead of fretting over getting boys to like you too much. In the end, the right boy will come along and sweep you off your feet.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118856}
{"text":" Look over at him when you\u2019re in the same room and smile at him to let him know you\u2019re friendly and that looking at him makes you happy. Don\u2019t overdo it, but you can definitely catch his eye several times during a class, game, or party. You can shyly look away once you catch his eye, or keep up the eye contact.;\n, Pick out a favorite outfit that makes you feel beautiful and comfortable so that you feel confident the next time you see him. Don\u2019t feel like you need to wear \u201cstylish\u201d clothes that other people are wearing, because he may not even like or notice them, but he will pay attention when you feel comfortable and at ease.\n\n, Experiment with how to wear your hair and makeup, but keep it simple and ultimately go with what you think looks great on you and makes you feel good. Always start by practicing good hygiene: shower and wash your hair, wear deodorant, and brush your teeth every day.\n\n\nWear your hair down or up in a ponytail or bun, or however you like to wear it best. Try playing around with curling or straightening it for a new look if you want.\nBrush a little mascara on your eyelashes and apply some concealer or foundation to your skin if you want to cover up any redness or acne.\n\n, Stand next to him when you\u2019re in a group, and get close if you\u2019re sitting next to him. You can even lightly touch him on the arm while you\u2019re talking or give him a playful push if he\u2019s teasing or joking with you.But pay attention to the signs he\u2019s giving you. Some people don\u2019t like others in their close personal space or feel uncomfortable with touch; it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he doesn\u2019t like you.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to get too close or touch him, you can simply mimic his body language. If he crosses his arms, leans his head on his hand, or stands with his hands in his pockets while he\u2019s talking to you, wait at least 20 seconds and do the same or something similar. This is a very subtle way to show you are paying attention and interested in him., Observe him to see what kinds of books he reads, music he listens to, or teams he follows. While he\u2019s around, try reading a book by the same author or wearing a band t-shirt that you think he would like as a way of getting him to initiate a conversation before you do., Write him a sweet or funny note and slip it into his locker. You can leave it anonymous by signing it with a code name or word and tell him he has to figure out who it is through clues you give him in each letter. Stick with a simple joke or compliment in your letters if you don\u2019t want to get too mushy or forward right away.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118857}
{"text":"\n\n\nAre you lonely? \u00a0If so, this is not the answer. \u00a0Getting involved in a relationship just because you are lonely may cause you to settle for less than you deserve; or it may lead you to become dependent on him (which is not healthy for you or attractive to him).\nDo you want someone to listen? \u00a0If so, a boyfriend may not be the best option. \u00a0Try to seek counseling. \u00a0Not only will you be able to express your emotions, but you will also not run the risk of being rejected by a man, which could exaggerate your depression.\nAre you seeking physical contact? \u00a0Sex has all kinds of wonderful effects for the mind and body, but it can be equally damaging if rushed into with the wrong person. \u00a0The good news is that the same chemicals we release during sex can be stimulated by hugging those we love in a non-sexual way. \u00a0Some studies have even indicated that laughing heartily can release these chemicals. It may not be as thrilling as sexual contact, but it could save a lot of heartache to hold out on intimate contact until you are in a healthy state of mind and capable of truly loving another.\nIf your need for a relationship does not fall into one of the lines of reasoning above, and you feel that you simply want a boyfriend to have a more complete social life, then start simple.;\n, \u00a0Write them down. \u00a0Be realistic (e.g. if you are 120 pounds overweight and think hiking is a Kool-Aid flavor, you probably are not going to snag a bodybuilder). \u00a0Think beyond the physical qualities. \u00a0If you are depressed, you are going to want someone who is strong enough to minimize your mood swings, but also sensitive enough to be a shoulder to cry on.\n\n, \u00a0If you are religious, look for someone who practices the same faith (remember practicing a faith and believing in it are two very different things). \u00a0If you are into fitness, switch up your routine and attend a body pump or cycling class to find a man who can become your workout partner. \u00a0If you are in school, try to\u00a0talk to him about a project, class, or sport you find interesting. \u00a0Connecting with someone is way more complicated than we make it out to be. \u00a0If you have a hobby and he does too - you have an icebreaker. \u00a0If you don't have a hobby...try something out! \u00a0This may help both with meeting a man and to cure your depression.\n\n, \u00a0Invite him to hang out with you and your friends, or invite him to something casual. \u00a0You are in a delicate mindset now, and you can't just jump into a relationship until you have eased your depression symptoms. \u00a0Don't forget that. Your task is finding a happy relationship, but also finding a happy you. \u00a0Don't suffocate your depression for the passing thrill of a man who may or may not be there for the long term.\n\n, \u00a0This is not going to be as easy as \"Hi, my name is Becky and I am depressed\" (obviously!), but you need to find some way to discuss the subject to see if it is something that he can handle. \u00a0If this relationship is going to be genuine, you cannot hide your emotional struggles from him.\n\n, \u00a0Talk about an article, movie, or current event that has to do with depression. \u00a0Talk about that, and transition into asking if he has ever suffered from depression or if he knows anyone who has. \u00a0This will serve many purposes. \u00a0First, it will allow you to understand whether he really sees depression as what it is (a mental illness which is normal and can be cured), or whether he is ignorant on the topic. You will also be able to see if he has encountered it in the past.\n\n\nIf his answer is something to the tune of yes - he is familiar and\/or he has experienced it, open up. \u00a0You don't need to go into detail, but let him know that you are struggling. \u00a0Tell him you are working on eradicating it from your life (and you better be!) and remember to envelope any self-critical statements with positive aspects about yourself. \u00a0There is no shame in depression.\nIf his answer is no, that's ok. \u00a0Educate him a little on the topic. Whether or not he ends up as your boyfriend, you can help one more person understand mental illness for what it is rather than the stigma it gets in mainstream culture.\nIf his answer is ignorant or negative - toss him. \u00a0Definitely do NOT cover up your situation because you are scared of some man looking down on you. \u00a0The boyfriend you need is the one who actually cares, not the one who judges based on things out of your control.\n\n, \u00a0Again, no matter how sweet or supportive he is, if you are genuinely depressed, he is not going to solve it. \u00a0Go to therapy. Meditate. \u00a0 Exercise. \u00a0Read self-help books. \u00a0Dedicate at least one hour a day to fixing your mind.\n\n, \u00a0You may wake up with tears in your eyes while he feels the happiness in a new day. \u00a0Being depressed is like living under a dark cloud that no one sees but you. Be open to accept his positivity and love. \u00a0If you have to, just fake a smile. \u00a0Sometimes that is all it takes to turn your mood around.\n\n, \u00a0If he asks questions, don't hide. \u00a0Answer. \u00a0Talk openly about how you feel, but don't make depression the center stage in your relationship. \u00a0Do uplifting things with your man - ride bikes, go jogging, visit zoos or aquariums, anything that is uplifting.\n\n, They will make you horrible to your partner, and they will only hurt you in the long run. \u00a0You cannot cure your mind if you constantly adulterate it.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118858}
{"text":" This is so important, especially for teenagers. You have to be happy being single and you can never be dependent on having a boyfriend. Basically, be sure having a boyfriend is good for you and be happy with yourself! Personally, I see so many women and girls who feel a boyfriend completes them, and deep down are unhappy with themselves. If you are young, it's a good idea to wait until you are in high school, or preferably can drive before dating. Don't rely on guys to make you feel loved or happy, happiness comes from within.;\n, For instance, if you want a guy who can make you laugh, you have things in common with, but is a gentlemen and treats you with respect and you happen to find a guy who is funny and charming but isn't such a gentlemen, don't settle. There's many fish in the water and there will be someone better for you! Set your standards high, but also don't be extremely selective.\n\n, Many people say 'appearance does not matter, it's what's on the inside that counts' but truthfully it does. Let's face it, no one wants the person they're dating to be lazy and sloppy looking. At the same time, you don't have to be a rich perfect-looking supermodel to get the guy you like, but just be happy with yourself and look your best. Dress nicely to flatter your figure without being overly-exposing, and wear subtle makeup to enhance your eyes or maybe try a new hairstyle.\n\n, The idea that girls should be cute and guys should be tough may not be good for society, but because they are based on human instinct, many guys sub-consciously want cute vulnerability in girls, even if they consciously think strong women are admirable. Lying about who you are is bad, but if you have a cute and vulnerable side, let it show.\n\n, Smile, and talk to people, and if you're out on the prowl for a guy, don't bring more than one friend with you. Also, you want to look good, but if your look is especially fashion forward or avant garde, you might look great, but you won't look very approachable. A quiet girl who looks like she just stepped off the runway at a fashion show might catch a guy's interest, but even the most beautiful girls don't get asked out often if they don't seem approachable.\n\n, Go do the things you like and find other guys who like doing the same things. It shows you have things in common. Try to find guys you like and approach them in a friendly way. Don't be overly flirtatious which could lead to rejection or bad first impressions. Don't be too shy, which could lead to never getting a chance though. Be yourself, most importantly, and have them like the real you.\n\n, For example, if you want a smart guy, join a chess club.\n\n, If you both have a good connection, congrats you've found someone to date. If things don't work out, you haven't found the right person and it's nothing against you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118859}
{"text":" Smiling is by far the most effective thing you can do to attract men. If you do nothing else, be sure to smile around the man you are interested in romantically. Not only do women look most attractive when they smile, smiling sends the signal to men that you are happy, friendly, and approachable. It also reflects a sense of confidence, which both men and women find extremely rare and attractive.\n\n\nGet in the habit of forcing a smile on your face if you catch yourself frowning. Some people are naturally predisposed to frowning when they are extremely focused or distracted, so it will take some practice to condition yourself to smile more.\nMany women look to models who scowl in photographs and try to imitate them, thinking it will make them mysterious and sultry. Remember that while scowling may be \"fashionable,\" it doesn't translate into being attractive. In fact, many trends in fashion tend to be unflattering and unattractive from the point of view of men.;\n, Men are universally attracted to women who feel confident about who they are on both the inside and the outside. This doesn't necessarily mean you should constantly boast or act as if you are superior to other people; in fact, being overly confident can be a turn-off to some men. Instead, focus your efforts on finding a sense of inner peace. This means accepting the things you cannot change about yourself and making an effort to change the things you can.\n\n\nEven if you have some doubts about yourself, like most do try not to point out your flaws or insecurities around men. Pointing out your flaws will only cause him to focus on them and discover negative qualities that he might not have even noticed on his own.\nAvoid constantly fidgeting with your hair or adjusting your clothes while talking to a man you are interested in, as these little acts show that you are self-conscious about your appearance.\n\n, Men like women who are on the one hand educated and well-read, and at the same time open to learning and accepting new information. No matter what age you are, you should approach every new experience as an opportunity to learn something new.\n\n\nAvoid saying prejudiced, disrespectful, or ignorant things in front of a man you're interested in. While it's great to voice your opinion, you should be careful that what you say isn't offensive in any way.\n\n, While some women are naturally more shy than others, there is a big difference between being shy and being timid. Shy women may not crave the spotlight, but they can still be open to new experiences and having fun. Timid women, on the other hand, tend to be more negative, uptight and conservative. Make a conscious effort to just let loose and have fun. Not only will it instantly attract men, it makes your own life a great deal easier to not take things so seriously.\n\n, Men are attracted to women who are down to earth and are easy to get along with. Avoid being overly dramatic or emotionally sensitive. Don't say negative things about people behind their backs, and don't instigate fights with a man for no reason.\n\n\nWhile some conflicts are unavoidable in long-term relationships, try not to be the type of woman who starts drama everywhere she goes. It's important to accept that not everybody will please you all of the time, and that that's okay.\n\n, Most men care more about a woman's body than they do about her face or her hair. While some men like curvy women and others like thinner women, the most important thing is that a woman is healthy and in shape. Regardless of how much you weigh, it is important to get regular exercise and keep your body toned.\n\n\nIf you are overweight and want to lose weight, then make a commitment to getting in shape. Not only will it help you attract men, it will also improve your overall quality of life, giving you more energy and reducing your likelihood for certain diseases.\nBe sure to stay properly groomed. You don't have to look completely put together all the time, but it's important to stay on top of your personal hygiene. Pluck, shave, and\/or wax as needed, shower every day, and wear deodorant to prevent unpleasant body odor.\nThere's nothing wrong with going au natural. If that's the choice you've made, though, you've got to commit to it and be proud of your body.\n\n, Again, fashion is a topic on which men and women tend to diverge dramatically. While women usually try to stay up-to-date with what is currently on vogue, men are more concerned with whether a woman's clothes are flattering for her body type. When it comes to attracting men, it's more important to wear figure-flattering clothes than to wear ones that are considered \"fashionable\" or \"edgy\" at the moment. That said, there's no one \"uniform\" for attracting guys. Wear clothing that feels like an honest and comfortable presentation of yourself.\n\n, Makeup should be used to enhance your natural beauty, not to create a false image. The general rule of thumb when it comes to men and makeup is: if he notices it, you're probably wearing too much. Stick to neutral colors that match your natural skin tone, and be sure to properly blend the makeup into your face to avoid flaking or discoloration.\n\n\nRemember that while men are men, they still know what makeup is. In other words, you're not tricking anybody by piling on loads of mascara or lipstick. Men know what a natural face looks like and they know what an overly done-up face looks like.\nSpecial occasions like weddings, birthday parties, or nights out on the town are an exception to this rule. It's okay to get all dolled up every once in a while, just don't get in the habit of hiding your true face from the world on a regular basis.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118860}
{"text":" It could be because he has feelings for you, which you truly don't reciprocate, or it could be because you don't want to impair your friendship. If you have feelings for him, then tell him! He will not feel the same towards you if you reject him, so don't expect things to be exactly the same between the two of you. He may avoid you, or even harbour feelings of hatred, because you two were so close.\n\n\nStudies have shown that men often mistake signs of friendship as signs of desire, so don't expect your guy to be all happy when you reject him. He honestly thought you two could have something special.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, If your friendship up until that point had been extremely fun and witty and open, then expect that to continue. Tell him how you feel, and then arrange the date. This should be easy since you know each other well! Keep things the way they used to be, and try to keep the laughter in your relationship until the big date.\n\n, \"I don't know; where do you wanna go?\" situation. You know each other really well at this point, so you should know where the best situation would be. Classic date-situations are movies, ice-skating, dinners, bowling, entertainment parks, walking around town, and even tutoring. Tutoring may sound kind of lame, but if one of you is smarter than the other in certain areas, then try to play to that aspect. Teach each other something, shared learning will help secures your bond. Bowling is fun because it sparks a friendly competition that will help keep conversation rolling. Ice skating is perfect in this scenario, because then there is an excuse for you to hold hands, and the cold can encourage cuddling .\n\n, If you and your date are already best friends, then you are probably in the same group of friends, and it's best to keep things personal and private for awhile. If things don't work out, then you don't want to have to go through the agony of telling everybody why not...\n\n, Jeans are always fine in a casual date between you and your best friend, as long as you have a little bit more of a dressy top, like a shirt with sequins, or a nice necklace with a sweet tank-top and cardigan.\n\n\nTry to let your personality shine through, so that your boy knows that you're still who he thinks you are, and that the only thing that has changed is how you're going to act towards each other. A skirt is fine, but don't go all the way with a dress. That says \"Ok, I am trying way to hard, and I am extremely nervous\". Unless you're at prom, or a dinner, or a party. Hopefully, it should be just the two of you for a first date. Anything else isn't private enough. Keep it simple, although less casual than usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, When he arrives, and this will probably be the first time you see each other after the date-arrangement, don't be awkward. Show that you're still you, but that your feelings for him, are really there, and so that will eliminate his nervousness.\n\n, Don't be in a hurry to change his status with them until you are more comfortable with the relationship.\n\n, That does not mean, however, old boyfriends, intimate gossip, school, or anything else that you usually talk about. You can bring back old jokes, and relive old memories, and talk about yourselves. You need to get to know each other all over again, but in a different light. Don't talk about your grades, because you probably know a lot about each other already! Talk about new things, and what you think of each other.\n\n, That doesn't mean groping, or else he will definitely think that you're not the person he thought he knew, and the end of your relationship in definite. Touch his arm when you want his attention, or when you're trying to make a point. Keep it above the waist, guys.\n\n, This one is important; if you get this wrong, your relationship may not work out. It has to be sweet and innocent, not a wet fish. No tongues. Go for about a 10 second kiss, at some point during your date.\n\n\nKeep the lips firm, yet open. Don't let your mouth hang open, but don't be tight-lipped. You don't want your guy to think that you don't like them. If you're going in for a second kiss, go for another 10-20 second one. No tongues on the first date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don't want him to think that you're different than who he thinks you are, which is why he likes you! At the end of the date, hopefully you can both say that you've had a lot of fun, like you used to, yet your romance was the key ingredient. You're still best friends, except you're more now, so hugging is great too.\n\n, He will probably be punching the air, except you don't need to know that, in his oh-so-manly opinion. Don't worry; it's a good thing!\n\n, You have to be comfortable with each other in public. Make sure people know that you're a couple, and be happy about it. Don't shut out your other friends, but make sure they know that you two are sort of in the love bubble.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118861}

{"text":" Pigeons are natural scavengers who thrive off the waste that humans leave behind.\n\n\nIf you maintain a clean property, free of food scraps and loose fruit and vegetation, you are decreasing the chance that pigeons will roost by your home or apartment building.\nWhile this may not prevent the pigeons from occasionally traveling through, they probably won't be sticking around long.\nMake sure you have trash cans and\/or dumpsters that can close. This will keep pigeons and other pests away.;\n, Place fence or netting around the areas where pigeons roost. Placing these types or netting and wire around the ledges and perches of your property will effectively encourage pigeons to set up shop elsewhere.\nBefore they set up residence, you can cover ledges and other roosting spots with sheet metal. Set this at an angle as it will be difficult for pigeons to roost on a slope.\nYou can also prevent pigeons from roosting with bird netting. This will keep pigeons at bay without harming them.\nPlace bird netting around trees and barn rafters.\n\n, These are rows of small spikes that prevent pigeons from congregating and roosting. These strips of spikes. are placed around the perimeter of large buildings.\nThey are spaced out specifically to prevent pigeons from resting and roosting on roofs and fences.\nThese are relatively inexpensive and humane.\n\n, These are essentially the equivalent of scarecrows, but designed for pigeons. These come in many different forms, from fake owls to flying model hawks.\nPigeons may get used to a model owl sitting in one place for a long period of time.\nThe most effective kind are model hawks attached to a kite with streamers. These will move in the wind and trick pigeons into thinking a predator is near.\n\n, These are typically in the form of large cages with a single door.\nThere are some more elaborate types of traps but simple ones are relatively inexpensive.\nYou can usually trap multiple pigeons in a single trap.\n\n, Do this in an area where you plan to place your pigeon trap.Let the pigeons feed off it for a few days.\nThe pigeons will become used to feeding there and will continue to return to the area.\nOnce the pigeons return continually for a few days you can place a trap.\n\n, Do this where you've been placing bait or where they roost.Leave the door open at first. Don't set the trap.\nYou will want the pigeons to get used to the trap's presence in their feeding or roosting area.\nPlace some bait inside the trap in the meantime to get the pigeons used to going inside of it. Cracked corn works best.\n\n, Do this once a large hoard of pigeons has assembled. You will want to trap as many as possible at once.\nMake sure to put in fresh bait regularly.\nMake sure the trap is secure where you've placed it.\n\n, Once you've trapped them, the presence of the birds will lure other pigeons to the area. It will be easier to trap more pigeons if they keep coming to the area.\nRemember to continually refresh the bait in your trap.\nBe careful when dealing with live birds or going near their roosting area.\n\n, You won't want to let them go on your own property or they will just roost again in the same spot.This will only really work well if your pigeons have only recently roosted on your property.\nPigeons that have been in a place for a long time will find their way back, even from a distance.\nContrary to opinion, pigeons are very intelligent and can find their way back to a roost from very far distances.\nThe best combination of methods is to use preventatives like netting and bird strips as well as traps to get rid of a pigeon problem.\n\n, Killing the pigeons should only be a last resort when all humane methods have failed. You don't want to unnecessarily harm an animal.\n\n\nOnly use a gun in a rural area away from other homes. There will likely be local ordinances on this in more crowded areas.\nWhile pigeons are not always a standard in rural areas, they are not wholly uncommon.\nIf you have annoying pigeons on your large property, it will be easy to shoot and kill pigeons with a low caliber gun like a .22 caliber rifle.\nBecause pigeons have, over time, developed a tolerance for humans and are rarely scared in their presence, it should not be very difficult to get a good shot.\n\n, Again, this should only be done as a last resort as it is inhumane.\n\n\nBird poison can hurt other animals, so be careful if you or your neighbors have pets. Be aware of other non-threatening wildlife in your area as well.\nBy baiting and poisoning pigeons, you can easily eliminate them.\nHow to dispose of a large number of dead pigeons is a big concern and poison is inhumane, so only poison pigeons as a last resort.\nTry all preventative and humane methods before resorting to this.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118961}
{"text":" You should purchase the highest quality birds that you can afford. It is better to purchase a smaller number of pairs of a higher quality, than a larger number of pairs of a lower quality. You should buy pigeons in pairs, unless you\u2019re buying a very specific pigeon of a particular pedigree.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re buying the pigeons for the purpose of racing, base your buying decision on performance before anything else. This can include the performance of the specific pigeons you\u2019re purchasing, the performance of the family line (i.e pedigree), or even the performance of the breed.If you\u2019re buying the pigeons for show purposes, or you just want really cool looking pigeons, then you\u2019ll want to base your buying decision on conformation. For show purposes, judges pick winning pigeons based on a certain list of physical characteristics.Homing pigeons can cost anywhere from approximately $50 up to several hundred dollars, depending on the pedigree and breeder.Keep in mind that in addition to the cost of the pigeons, you must also pay the cost of shipping. And because you\u2019re shipping live animals, shipping can be quite expensive, depending on where you\u2019re ordering from.;\n, Your pigeons are going to need a place to live the minute they arrive at your door, so be prepared. Pigeon homes are referred to as lofts and lofts can come in a variety of sizes and configurations. You can build your own, hire someone to build one for your, or order one pre-made. Each pair of pigeons should have approximately 8-10 cubic feet of space inside the loft - so the space you have available for a loft might also dictate the maximum number of pigeons you can have.Some of the most important things to remember about a loft is that it should: protect your pigeons from predators (including the neighbourhood cat), have both interior and exterior (protected) space for the birds, have an excellent ventilation system, and have additional space for feed and equipment (you don\u2019t want to store this stuff outside). If you\u2019re breeding your pigeons, you will also need to separate out a space just for them and their eventual offspring.Pigeon lofts need to be located in an area somewhat free of aerial obstructions. Remember, your pigeons fly, so wires, trees, lamp posts, etc., can be a distraction for your pigeons when you\u2019re trying to train them.Racing pigeon lofts should be designed so the birds don\u2019t spend a lot of time on the roof. This means the roof should not be flat, if possible, and might need bird spikes to help deter your pigeons from landing., Pigeon breeders and sellers are located around the world. If you\u2019re concerned about the cost of shipping your pigeons, you\u2019ll probably want to choose a breeder located as close to you as possible. Otherwise you\u2019ll want to choose a breeder based on pigeon performance and pedigree.Most breeders band their pigeons when they\u2019re young, so this is not something you\u2019ll have to do once you receive your pigeon.Ask for recommendations from a local pigeon club if you\u2019re unsure as to the reputation of a breeder.\n\n, If these are your first pigeons, then you can put them in the loft right away without a problem. However, if you\u2019re adding new pigeons to your collection, you\u2019ll need to keep them separated from your existing pigeons for a couple of weeks., Your pigeons need clean water everyday. Their food should be consumed within 15-20 minutes of you giving it to them. After 15-20 minutes cleanup and remove anything they haven\u2019t eaten. They\u2019ll also need grit to ingest, which helps them obtain vitamin and minerals, and assists with digestion.You\u2019ll need to feed your pigeons (using the 15-20 minute technique) twice per day.\n\n\nRemember to clean your loft on a regular basis, especially the floor.\nThere are several bird-specific online stores located around the United States that specialize in pigeon care. Their level of experience will be helpful if you\u2019re new to the world of pigeons.Pigeons will require more protein if they\u2019re breeding, but more energy (i.e. fat and carbohydrates) when their racing. The protein amounts contained in the feed should be listed on the bag. For breeding season you should feed them a 16-18% crude protein mix. For racing and training season you should feed them a 14-15% crude protein mix. When you pigeons are molting, in the off season, you\u2019ll want to feed them the 16% crude protein mix again.\nWhile all veterinarians have learned to care for birds as part of their training, not all veterinarians will take care of birds on a regular basis. If you already have a vet whom you trust, and they feel confident they can treat your pigeons, great. If not, ask for recommendations or referrals to a bird-specific vet in your area. You can also ask for referrals from a local pigeon racing club, or pigeon rescue organization.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118962}

{"text":" Because pigeons are social animals, keeping a single one is only recommended if you're sure you can offer enough time and companionship to keep your pigeon happy.\n\n\nYou should also consult local regulations to verify that you are permitted to keep pigeons.There are many different breeds of pigeons and their respective social needs vary considerably. However, you should be able to set aside some time every day to help socialize your pigeon.;\n, You should have indoor accommodations for your pigeon and, if at all possible, outside accommodations as well. It is important that you prepare these ahead of time. It will be disconcerting to the pigeon to relocate it without providing it with a new home immediately. Clean all cages before your pigeon arrives.\n\n\nAn ideal indoor cage is rectangular and partially enclosed. Be sure that there are no holes in the cage long enough for the pigeon to stick its head through. Because pigeons like to walk, the bottom of the cage should be covered with paper or grassy sod. Keep the cage in a bright area but not one with direct sunlight. If the cage is in a place liable to be exposed to light at night, you should cover the cage during the evening.\nAn outdoor aviary should be approximately 6\u2019 square and 8\u2019 high. Include shelves for nesting, including one as high as possible in the enclosure. The enclosure should be sturdy enough to protect against outside predators. If possible the aviary should be oriented toward the south or southwest, allowing for maximum sunlight.include in the housing a bath that the bird can use to clean itself.\nCertain breeds are adapted to free flight. You can provide them with a \u201cdovecote,\u201d which is a small structure that can be attached to the side of your house. Be aware, however, that your bird could be hunted by predators if permitted to fly freely., There are a variety of mixes that are designed for pigeons and doves. Pelleted diets are the best source of nutrients. Seed diets and other commercial mixes will require more supplementation.\n\n\nYou can supplement the pigeons regular diet with lettuce, endive, chickweed, spinach, berries, apple, and pears.\nProviding the pigeon with grit and gravel will help it digest its food.\nPet stores also sell vitamins and calcium supplements for birds that can help improve your pigeons health., Online you can find databases of local breeders.. Some locations also have issues with abandoned pigeons. That means you should be able find them at the local animal shelter.Either way, you should ask about the breed of pigeon and care specifications, because different breeds vary considerably in terms of needs and behavior.\n\n\nit is recommended that you meet a few pigeons beforehand to check for allergies, and make sure they meet your expectations.

This will both support and secure the pigeon in your hand.The pigeon's legs should gently rest between your fingers.\nDon't hold the legs or the pigeon too tightly.\nIdeally, your pigeon will be in its cage when you try to pick it up.\n\n, After the pigeon is in your hand and its legs are between your fingers, you can grasp the bird with your thumb. Bring your thumb down, covering the wings. Keeping its wings secure will help keep your pigeon safe and prevent it from flying away.Don't hold the wings down tightly.\nThe wings should rest flatly on the pigeon's back.\n\n, After you've gotten a good hold on your pigeon, you can move it towards your body. Bringing it closer to your body will help it feel secure and will allow you to support and hold it safely.You can cup the bird with your other hand to provide even more security.\nMove the pigeon slowly to avoid scaring it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118965}
{"text":" If the pigeon is shaking, bleeding, or vomiting, immediately take him to an avian veterinarian. If you are not sure where to take the pigeon, call the WildCare Hotline at (415) 456-7283. They can also tell you how to care for the pigeon.Always seek urgent care if you have a baby pigeon. If the pigeon makes any type of squeaking or chirping sound, you have a juvenile pigeon.;\n, A small cardboard box or a bird cage can be used to house the pigeon. If you use a cardboard box, poke small holes in the side of the box for ventilation.You could also place a screen on top of the box for ventilation.Line the bottom with a soft cloth or some paper towels.An ideal cage would be at least 42\u2033 wide, 27\u2033 deep, and 30\u2033 high. You can also use a small dog or cat crate.\nAny container that you use should protect the pigeon from any cats or dogs.\n\n, If the pigeon is tame or injured, you should be able to pick the pigeon up with your hands. If you can\u2019t pick the pigeon up, try throwing a towel over the bird and then scoop the pigeon in the towel and place it in the box. You can also use food to bait the pigeon into the container.You can also walk behind the pigeon to get him to walk into the container or into a place where you can easily catch him.\nGrab him across the back and gently hold him with two hands.\n\n, If you have a baby pigeon, place him in a ventilated box with the heating pad turned on low. Half of the container should be heated and the other half should not. Baby pigeons have a special diet. Call the WildCare Hotline to get instructions to care for the pigeon and find a hospital or veterinarian for the baby pigeon.Call the number before you feed the pigeon. Improper feeding can result in death or a serious injury.\n\n, Put water in a container that is at least 1 inch deep (e.g. old margarine tub). Water is more important than food if a pigeon is lost. The pigeon may be exhausted and not recognize the water. If you notice that the pigeon is not drinking, dribble a few drops of water into the container to make a splashing sound.If the pigeon looks super exhausted, put a teaspoon of Gatorade in two cups of water and give it to the pigeon. This will help replace lost electrolytes.\n\n, Pigeons eat grains and seeds. Go to a feed store to purchase pigeon feed. Pet stores usually do not carry pigeon feed. If you cannot go to a feed store, you can buy wild bird seed or dove and quail mix from the pet store.You can also give the pigeon uncooked popcorn, rice, split peas, barley, and buckwheat. Do not give your pigeon a slice of bread.Start by giving 2 tablespoons in the morning and see how much the pigeon eats. Adjust the amount until all of the food you provide in the morning is gone by the end of the day., In addition to grains, your pigeon will enjoy eating vegetables 3 or 4 times a week. Chop or mince vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, snap peas, kale, cauliflower, dandelion greens, edamame, and bell peppers.Wash the vegetables to remove any chemicals before you feed them to your pigeon.The vegetables should be placed in a small, separate dish.\nStart out with 2 tablespoons and reduce the amount based on how much your pigeon eats.\n\n, If you have found a racing pigeon, they will be wearing a leg band. The band will tell you where the bird is registered, the year the bird was hatched, the pigeon club, and the pigeon\u2019s unique number.Some bands may have the owner\u2019s name and contact information. If the bird does not have a band, it is a wild pigeon.\n\n\nIf the leg band has the owner\u2019s contact information, contact the owner and let them know that you have their pigeon.\nIf there is no contact information, you will have to read the leg band to determine who to contact.\n\n, The first 2 letters of the leg band will let you know which national organization that pigeon belongs to. You can then contact the organization and let them know that you have found one of their pigeons. All of these organizations have websites. Here are some common organizations:\n\n\nAU stands for the American Racing Pigeon Union.\nCU stands for the Canadian Racing Pigeon Union.IF stands for International Federation of American Homing Pigeon Fanciers.NPA stands for the National Pigeon Association.If the band says \u201cIFB\u201d call 1-877-355-7727 or email them at foyspigeon@zoominternet.net.\nADA stands for the American Dove Association and you can contact them at secretary@doveline.com.\nIf the band has letters that you cannot identify, contact the American Racing Pigeon Union. They will help you find the owner.\nThe Vancouver Poultry & Fancy Pigeon Association will also help you locate the owner if you are unable to do so. Email them at info@vancouverfancypigeon.ca.\n\n, If the pigeon does not have a leg band, it is most likely a wild pigeon. Do not keep a wild pigeon as your pet. It is better to take care of the pigeon for a few days until you can get him some help at a rescue society.Most pigeons can find their way home after 1 or 2 days of rest, food, and water. Take the bird to an area without electrical wires and plenty of open space and release the pigeon.Again, you can call the WildCare Hotline at (415) 456-7283 to find a rescue place for the pigeon. Avoid calling your local humane society. They are more likely to euthanize the pigeon instead of providing care and releasing him back into the wild.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118966}
{"text":" Imagine something similar to a bed of nails, but with the nails tilted in different directions - this is a pigeon spike. Since it\u2019s not a flat, comfortable surface, pigeons will tend to avoid areas where these spikes are installed. They are best installed in areas where pigeons would attempt to congregate for nesting or sleeping.In addition to the spikes (which come in metal and plastic) there are also pigeon coils, which are coiled pieces of wire (like a slinky) that can be stretched out to allow for different sized spaces between each loop.;\n, Bird slopes are slippery, sloped surfaces you install on your roof that a pigeon, or any bird for that matter, can\u2019t grip with their feet. Instead, they slip and slide until they \u201cfall off\u201d (i.e. fly away). Bird slopes are nice in that they can be made to blend in with your roof and won\u2019t look as obvious as bird spikes., Bird nets are nets to deter birds, not catch them.Nylon netting is used for large surface areas like tall buildings or fields of crops. Because the nylon is quite thin, it can be made to look almost invisible on a tall building. Depending on what type of structure it\u2019s covering, you may want to check that the netting is fire and water proof.Bird nets are designed for large spaces and are therefore better suited for commercial or agricultural use, rather than residential.\nPigeons can also be prevented from entering certain locations using wire mesh instead of nylon netting. It is heavier but also comes in different sizes depending on your needs., This \u201cscarecrow\u201d doesn\u2019t have to look like the traditional ones you remember from movies like The Wizard of Oz, but simply needs to take the shape and size of a human. (Another term used somethings is \u201chuman effigy\u201d.) They work just like you\u2019d expect, but more modern versions can be made of inflatable material that blows around, creating movement that helps scare the pigeons away., Repellent gel is sticky and when a pigeon lands on\/in it, it\u2019s uncomfortable and they fly away. You can also use crushed dried chili peppers instead of gel to get a similar result. Keep in mind, however, that this method, especially the chili peppers, washes away and has to be reapplied.This is more of a short-term, temporary option if you need a quick fix.\n\n\nNote that some repellent gels (and liquids) are not legal in some countries. Make sure your check your country\u2019s laws before using these types of products., A pigeon predator can take the form of a statue, robot or even the real thing. The best predators for pigeons are peregrine falcons and owls.Some fake predators can be automated to move and make sounds to scare pigeons away.Others are just plastic or wood decoys molded and painted to look like an owl or peregrine falcon, although some are designed to have moveable parts driven by the wind, so no power or batteries are required.Robotic fake predators can be costly and are designed more for commercial than residential use.\nAs with other \u201cbird\u201d deterrents, the fake predator may also scare away all other birds, including the ones you may want to keep around.\n\n, Scare balloons are designed to be bright, reflective, and scary to a pigeon. They aren\u2019t filled with helium to float, but rather are hung from trees, balconies, decks, etc.Flashing eyes are large flat boards with eyes painted on both sides. The eyes are mounted on a stake that\u2019s put in the ground, and mirrors are placed to reflect up into the eyes as they spin. The combination of eyes, movement and reflective material help scare pigeons away from the area.Flash tape essentially looks like large pieces of tinsel, with an iridescent surface that is sometimes made to look like eyes (like the flashing eyes). It comes in rolls (like tape) and can be cut to various lengths and hung anywhere to blow in the wind.Note that all these devices are not bird-specific and will work on any bird that is not a predator. Therefore these items might also scare away birds you want to attract like swallows, hummingbirds and chickadees.\n\n, When a pigeon\u2019s movements are detected by the motion detector, a sound, sometimes at an ultrasonic frequency, is played. This sound is annoying to the pigeon and they won\u2019t stick around. If the motion detector plays ultrasonic sounds, humans won\u2019t be able to hear them, so it won\u2019t be annoying to you.Note that motion detectors need a certain amount of clear space in front of them, and must be set up at certain heights and intervals to be effective.\nMotion detectors can also be designed to spray water (from an attached hose) rather than play a sound.As with other \u201cbird\u201d deterrents, the motion detector may also scare away all other birds, including the ones you may want to keep around.\nUltrasonic devices should NOT be used in an area also occupied by bats., Pigeons are hanging out on your property because they\u2019ve found food and\/or water they can easily access. If you remove that food and water, your property won\u2019t look as appealing to the pigeons and they may relocate.This is obviously more difficult to do if you\u2019re in a highly populated urban area where your property is surrounded by the property of others at a close proximity. The food and water might actually be located on someone else\u2019s property, but yours is close enough for them to fly to for resting and nesting. In this case you may want to consider bringing up the problem with your landlord, condo association, community league or city council.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118967}
{"text":" The best food for a fledgling pigeon is a commercial baby bird formula. These can easily be obtained from a pet food supply store.You can also feed a fledgling pigeon chick crumbles that can be crushed into smaller pieces and mixed with water. These can be purchased at a pet store.\nIn emergency situations, you can feed a fledgling pigeon dog biscuits that have been crushed and softened by mixing with warm water.\nDo not feed a fledgling milk or bread crumbs.;\n, Follow the instructions provided on the package in order to prepare the formula for feeding. In most cases you will need to mix the formula with warm water. For young birds you will mix 1 part formula with 6 parts water. As the pigeon ages you will decrease the water content.Do not heat the water or formula in the microwave because this can create hot pockets that will burn the fledgling.\n\n, Most fledgling pigeons receive their food from their parents. In order to mimic this type of feeding, use a syringe to feed to pigeon. Fill a syringe with the formula.A fledgling pigeon should eat approximately 24 ccs of formula, twice a day., Pigeons don\u2019t open their mouths when they want to be fed. As a result, you will need to push the sides of the beak in order to open the mouth. Have someone hold the body of the pigeon while you use your hands to open the mouth and insert the syringe. Gently squeeze out the formula.Stop feeding the pigeon once the crop is full.\nThe crop is a pocket that hangs on the inside of the chest. When full the chest should feel squishy, like a balloon filled with water., You can feed a fledgling by hand by placing seeds and chick crumble into the bird's mouth. For very young or distressed birds a syringe is easiest, but as the bird ages it will be able to take food from your hand., You should also help encourage a fledgling to begin eating food on its own. Place a few pigeon seeds in the bottom of the cage for the bird to eat. This will help the bird learn to pick up seeds on its own using its beak.Once the fledgling is eating seeds on its own, you can stop feeding it formula with a syringe.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118968}
{"text":"\n\n\nRoll your feet. Place the heel down first, lightly, then push into it as you shift your weight. Move more slowly on louder surfaces (gravel, sand, etc.)\nWear tight clothing. Loose clothing rubs together and can get snagged far more easily than Under Armour.\nControl your breathing. Through the nose and out the mouth is ideal, but different people breath better with different techniques.;\n, A person away from a group is better (a scout or sniper) than a cluster, because - obviously - one person can only look in one direction while more people can watch more areas.\n\n, The amount of time you have to observe them varies directly with how much the target is moving. For example, if the target is a sniper that is sitting perfectly still, not moving a muscle while they overlook the battlefield, you will have ample time to observe them. However, if they are a scout or commando heading towards your base, you may have less than thirty seconds to assess them.\n\n, Move silently and control your breath until you are within an arms length or less from them. This step takes much practice, as moving silently is not as easy as it seems. A creaking floor, a snapped twig, a crunched leaf, all of these can give you away. Another thing to remember is that if you move too fast, you will create a small movement of wind that will alert them to your presence, depending on how alert they are.\n\n, Note: Do not use these in real life. These are meant for friendly games, and can cause real damage if used with malicious intent.\n\n\nA choke hold is one method that requires no equipment. Step in close enough that your body is almost touching their back, then stomp or kick (use discretion if this is used in a game) the back of their knee, while at the same time pulling their head up. This will expose their throat. Loop your arm around their neck so that their throat is in the crook of your arm. With the hand of the choking arm, grab your other bicep, then clap your free hand over their mouth. If done properly, they will be unconscious in 5-10 seconds. After they go limp, release immediately.\nTake them hostage. Using the same methods as described above,kick the back of their knee, but instead of putting them in a choke hold, place one hand over their mouth and your paintball marker or airsoft gun in their back. They can then be 'interrogated' to reveal their teams plans. Not applicable with Manhunt.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118969}
{"text":" Cheaper guns are often unreliable and less effective. Note: A multi-shot shotgun is fine as long as you can cock and shoot it effectively. Getting a single shot shotgun is usually a pretty bad idea, as you are shooting an often inaccurate spring rifle.;\n, There is three common weights of bbs. .25; .20 and .12. Try to get seamless bbs, non seamless bbs can potentially break inside your airsoft gun, causing it to malfunction. Any weight is good, depending on your airsoft guns fps. If it has high fps, meaning its stronger; heavier bbs are good for you. But weaker airsoft guns, will need lighter bbs. If a strong airsoft gun shoots .12 bbs, the bbs will often be inaccurate and the distance is decreased.\n\n, Many real optics can be mounted as well, though these tend to cost much more than the airsoft replica versions.\n\n, They will in fact reach the target faster (because of the increased momentum, which helps to counter air resistance). Again, stay away from .12g BBs for any good gun. .12g BBs are also much more inaccurate than any of the other ammo types.\n, Heavier rounds will have lower FPS at the barrel, but will reach the target faster, and will give you more effective range (FPS does not equal range!).\n\n, You must be a part of your gun. Familiarization and skill with your weapons of choice is absolutely critical, and anything less will be that much more risk of you being on the losing end of things.\n\n, 4-8+ is generally a good group size for playing.

Let this come to a simmer, not a boil. Once the water is ready, slowly pour in a bit of the flour\/starch mixture and stir. Avoid making the mix too thick. It should have the consistency of cake batter. Add about 4 drops of food coloring to the mix. Consider wearing gloves and goggles while performing this task. Some of the mixture may splatter accidentally.\nChoose a bright color that can be seen on the paintball field. Add more drops to produce a brighter color.\nLet the mixture cool before filling the tubes. It should be at room temperature before proceeding.\n\n, Place the open-end part of the tube snug around the spray bottle snout or syringe. If using a spray bottle, simply squirt the mixture into the tube. When using a syringe, push the mixture into the tube slowly.\n\n\nIf you are concerned about leaking, tie a rubber band around the spout to make it more secure.\nIf not using a rubber band, hold the tube onto the spout or syringe with your free hand for extra security. The tube should be pretty tight on its on though, when using the correct size.\n\n, Once the tube is filled (3-4 inches in diameter) you can slowly remove the rubber band and the spray bottle or syringe.Twisting the open end several times will also achieve the same results.\n\n, Fold the open end down about an inch. Remove the clamp once you have a good grip. Slide a washer down the folded side. Take a 1\/8 inch cotter pin and slide it through the rubber tube, on top of the washer. , Make sure you and those around you are wearing the proper attire to launch paintball grenades. If thrown with enough force, they may cause bruising so cover up. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, as well as goggles.\n\n, To achieve the best results, it\u2019s a good idea to aim for a bunker at the paintball field or a fort.The impact will increase the spray radius. Plus you will be able to eliminate more players.\n\n, When ready, remove the cotter pin from the tube but leave the washer in place. Toss the grenade at the intended target. Once the washer hits the ground or other hard surface, the tube will burst open causing paint to splatter for several feet.

Always wear full seal ANSI rated goggles. Options include, Bolle tactical, Revision eyewear, and others as well as Save Phace and other paintball masks. Gear is much less important. When you first start just jeans and a sweatshirt will do you just fine. As you play more you can pick up gear and camouflage as needed.\n\n, Always have the muzzle in a safe direction, know your target and beyond, keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire, safety can and do fail, and do not point the weapon at something you do not intend to shoot.\n\n, Keep your goggles in a case or a provided bag so they don't get scratched. This is very important not only for safety reasons, but for cleaning as well. If cleaned after each use the rifle will last you much longer.\n\n, Avoid BBs you may find at stores like Walmart of Big 5, such as Crosman BBs. The best brands are Excel, G&G, Goldenball, and KSC.

{"text":" It's important to oxygenate your bloodstream, loosening up your muscles, warming them up, and getting them ready for heavy lifting. If you want to build muscles and avoid injuries, warming up is essential.\n\n\nStart with some basic push ups and sit ups, a few sets of each with a brief rest period between. Do a few sets, gradually increasing the number of reps in each set. You might start with 10 of each and work up to 50.;\n, It is important that you dynamic stretches and not static stretches. Dynamic stretches are moving stretches, whereas static stretches you hold a stretch in place. Studies have shown dynamic stretches to improve strength for workouts and reduce susceptibility to injury, while static stretches before a workout have been shown to weaken the muscles. An example of a dynamic stretch is arm swings. Swinging your arms up and down the full range of movement stretches the deltoids (shoulders), this would be ideal to do before say, shoulder press.\n\n, Ideally, you want to lift the most amount of weight you can manage for the amount reps that you intend to do. It is important to prioritize achieving the required rep count rather than sacrificing more than 3 reps so you can show off lifting heavier weights. This is known in gym culture as leaving the ego at the door. Having the discipline to resist going too heavy is a skill, and if you resist and stick to doing as much weight as you can for the amount of reps you need, you will make progress faster, because the number of reps you do determines how your muscles adapt.\n\n\nTrial a moderate amount of weight and make sure you have the form\/movement correct. If you feel you can do more for the amount of reps you are aiming to do, go heavier. Once you find the maximum amount you can manage for the amount of reps, stick with that. Next workout try adding a bit more weight.\nLifting weights that are too heavy to achieve the rep range you need is a bad idea, and you will look silly and like you trying hard to impress to any experienced lifters in the gym, so don't bother. Ideally you should not attempt weights that are too heavy for you to finish the reps by yourself\/without a spotter. If you need a spotter to help with a couple of reps, it means you picked a weight which is too heavy for you to finish the reps, and you need to lower it until a time where you are strong enough to manage the higher weight without assistance. Lifting weights that are too heavy is also one of the most common causes of injury in the gym, and there's plenty of compilations videos on the internet to give you an idea. Lifting weights that are too heavy can also serious strain and even damage your joints\/cartilage. Joint\/cartilage take longer to build\/strengthen\/adapt to training than muscles.\n\n, Different goals demand different amounts of reps.\n\n\nFor strength, you should be aiming for 4-6 repetitions.\nFor muscle hypertrophy (building bigger muscles) you should aim for 8-12 reps.\nFor muscle endurance you should aim for 15-20 repetitions.\nDifferent rep ranges also changes the energy system the body uses to supply the muscles. Lower rep sets use the adenosine triphosphate\/phosphocreatine (ATP\/PC) system. Higher reps use the aerobic energy system.\nPerforming a One Rep Max, or lifting the max amount of weight you can for a single repetition, can be invigorating and fun to show off, but should be used only as a point of measurement. In weightlifting, weights are often noted as a percentage of your 1RM (One Rep Maximum). For example if you could perform 100kg as your maximum for one repetition of bench press, then you lifted 75kg for 8-12 reps, you would be lifting 75% of your 1RM.\n\n, The proper lifting technique for each exercise differs slightly--you wouldn't use the same form for a bench press as you would for a dead lift--but what each lift has in common is that you need to extend and complete the motion all the way before you lockout. A bench press needs to come all the way down to your chest, and needs to extend to just before your elbows lockout.\n\n\nDo not lockout in any exercise. Firstly because, depending on the exercise, locking out can severely damage the joint(s) being used, especially with heavier weights, because it shifts the weight from the muscles the joint(s) For example with leg press, leg press will use one of the biggest amounts of weight of any exercise. If you full extend and lockout your knees, all the weight is shifting from the muscles to the knee joint. So you can see how that is damaging. Secondly, when you lockout you are taking the the strain off the muscles and putting it onto the joint, meaning your muscles are getting rest and making easier to do the exercise. Resisting from locking out will result in the exercise working the muscles much better. For example in a standing bicep curl, do not bring you hands all the way down, bring almost all the way then go back up, this prevent your biceps from getting unnecessary rest between reps.\n\n, Determine how much time your reps should take for your goals. Different amounts of time for reps are used for different aims. For strength, the concentric phase (muscle contraction) should be explosive and push up in 1 second, and the eccentric phase (muscle lengthening) should be slow, about 3 seconds. For muscle hypertrophy (growing bigger muscles) It should be 3 seconds concentric and 3 seconds eccentric. More time under tension breaks more muscle fibers, which is what you want if you are trying to gain muscle size. For muscle endurance, obvious a faster rater is used, about 1 second concentric and 1 second eccentric.\n\n\nTo clarify what is meant by concentric and eccentric, this is the two phases of lift, where muscles contract\/short, then lengthen. For example in a bicep curl, the concentric phase is when you lift up and shorten the bicep. In a tricep rope pull down, the concentric phase is when you pull down and shorten the tricep.\n\nStrength: 1 second explosive contraction - 3 seconds eccentric\nMuscle Hypertrophy: 3 seconds concentric - 3 seconds eccentric\nMuscle endurance: 1 second concentric - 1 second eccentric.\nDo not pause during a set, keep the tension on the muscles and don't lockout the joint being used.\n\n\n\n, You need to supply your muscles with oxygen just like you would if you were going running. For any weightlifting, you should breath out on the concentric phase, and breath in on the eccentric phase. So for example in a bench press, you would breathe out as you push the weight up, then breathe in as you lowered the weight back down. In a barbell row, you would breath out as you pulled the weight up, and breath out as you lowered it back down. Breathing properly is extra important with heavier lifts and with lifts that use the legs (because the leg muscles demand a lot of oxygen) For example in deadlifts and in squats, proper breathing is essential, not doing so can lead to lightheadedness, palpitations, dizziness, and even fainting. , Different goals also require different rest times:\n\n\nStrength: rest 2-4 minutes between sets\nHypertrophy: rest 1-2 minutes between sets\nEndurance: rest 30-60 seconds between sets\nBetween exercises where you are using the same muscle(s), rest at least 3 minutes. 2 minutes rest is sufficient if moving to an exercise using different muscles. More rest may be needed for the more demanding lifts like squats and deadlifts in order to allow your Central Nervous System to recuperate. If you find you are starting to get dizzy\/palpitations\/lightheaded progressively after sets of squats or deadlifts, try resting a bit longer, for at least 2 minutes.\n\n, If you don't have a friend to help re-rack the weight at the end of a set, for example benchpress, you may struggle to push up and re-rack the weight. If you don't have a spotter there then you'll be in trouble, it will be dangerous and embarrassing. Never exercise alone in general, if you run into complications you need to have someone around to help\/get help if needed. If you come to an empty gym, either don't train, or be extra safe during your workout and don't push too hard, and use assisted racks for exercises like bench press and squats so you can easily re-rack the weights without help.\n\n, As a cool down, you might have a specific activity or exercise that you like to do. Doing some static stretches and letting your body finish exercise slowly will make it much less likely that you'll be sore the next day, decreasing the possibility of injury or pulled muscles.\n\n, The pectoral muscles, the muscles that extend from the top of the shoulders across the chest, can be exercised by lifting free weights or flyweights in a flat or inclined \"push up\" motion.\n\n\nThe bench press is the most famous lift for a reason: laying on your back, usually on a weightlifting bench, you want to grab the bar shoulder-width apart. Plant your feet on either side of the bench, unpack the bar and position it (with the help of a spotter, as always) over your chest, keeping your muscles tight. Lower the weight slowly until it touches your chest, then push up forcefully, driving back and extending into the \"top\" or \"up\" position.Dumbbell presses involve a similar technique to the bench press, but use individual dumbbells in each hand.\n\nChest curls are likewise similar, though you'll keep your arms straight and extend them outward, like a bird flapping wings.\n\n, Using free-weights is an excellent way to strengthen your back, resulting in a toned physique and over-all strength and definition. Working out your shoulders and back muscles is essential in any total lifting routine.\n\n\n\nDo deadlifts. Deadlifts are a more advanced lift, and should only be completed with the aid of a spotter or a trainer who can assist you. It can be quite dangerous to deadlift if you don't know what you're doing, because it involves lifting the bar up from the ground, and powering it into an upright position. In some forms, you'll lift it to your chin, or up above your head.\n\nDo dumbbell rows. Working one arm at a time, from a kneeling position on a weight bench, lift one dumbbell from the ground up to your chest before lowering it to complete the rep, then alternate sides.\n\n, If you want to cash in your tickets to the gun show, start lifting to target your biceps and get them both bigger and stronger.\n\n\n\nDo bicep curls to build your biceps, either from a standing or seated position. Letting an appropriately-weighted dumbbell hang at your side, bring them to your chest by flexing your bicep. Alternate arms to complete the workout.\n\n, Don't neglect your legs, which make up a large and easy-to-neglect muscle group that you can work with free-weights. To do squats, you'll take the bar at a squat-station onto your shoulders, holding it securely behind your head, and squat down, keeping your back very straight and then driving back up.\n\n, If you do nothing but bench presses all week, you're not lifting correctly. Create a routine that varies the muscles you'll work on throughout the week, shaking it up while still highlighting the muscle groups that you're targeting and strengthening with your good technique. A weekly regimen might look something like this:\n\n\nMonday: Work on pecs\nTuesday: Work on legs\nWednesday: Aerobics and running\nThursday: Work out torso and back\nFriday: Work out abdominals.\nWeekend: Rest\n\n, With the proper technique, you should start to notice your regular routine get a little easier, which means you're getting stronger and starting to build muscle. Lifters call this a \"plateau\" and use it as a sign that it's time to start adding weight and varying the routine, to avoid flattening out.\n\n\nTo add weight, use weights which are still comfortable, but heavy enough to make those last few reps more difficult, finding that sweet spot, where the muscles almost fail.\n\n, To really start varying your work out and introduce a cardio element into the workout, you can mess with the amount of time you take to rest between your sets. If you're giving yourself a full minute between sets for your arm, cut it down to 15 or 30 and notice how much more difficult it becomes.\n\n\nListen to your body and don't rush yourself. Jumping straight into another set when you're exhausted is a good way to make a mistake and cause an injury. Be careful and train at your own pace.\n\n, It's a common mistake that rookies in the gym think lifting out three times a day is the quickest way to build strength and definition. This is not the case. Over-training can result in injury, keeping you sidelined from being able to work out properly for weeks or even months at a time. Lift correctly a few times and you'll start building muscle more quickly than you will lifting too often., After you finish your work out, always take a hot shower or bath. Steam-rooms are also popular after-workout routines, letting your muscles stay warm and \"cool down\" at their own pace. You'll notice your muscles will be less sore with the proper after-workout care.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118974}
{"text":" Be able to load your gun quickly. It can not be stressed enough how important it is to have more than just your standard 30 round low capacity magazine, you need more than that. For example you could have 5 Magazines for a Tokyo-Marui AEG, with around 300 shots available in Magazines. If you want to go an easier route then get a mid cap. They hold 80-200 rounds, and are very quiet. If you want you can get a 200-400 rnd. HiCap, but you have to wind them, and they rattle.;\n, This tactic has ups and downs. The ups are that you can work as a team, saying that you can cover your partner while they reload or vice versa. You also have twice the rounds being shot so you can easily take down more opponents than if you were alone. Downs to this tactic are that if there is a gunner with a \"SAW\" or some sort of heavy fire machine gun, then you're both pretty much hosed. Also having a second person can often lead to being spotted easier because you make more noise and there is a larger mass of people moving. A good Sniper-Spotter partnership is very valuable, because the average death of a sniper is because they are being sneaked up on, however if you have a spotter with an automatic rifle, then that really cuts down on that issue.\n\n, If you run from your house to your neighbors house and you are out of breath, well then you will not be very successful in your matches because there are a lot of hot situations where a lot of running is required to fall back and retreat, quickly getting to a good position is also important, so run there, don't drink your coffee and walk along talking to the guy next to you about how you wish you had this or that.\n\n, This way, it'll be more natural when you're in a real match. Hide behind a wall or tree and set up targets, and then have a friend time you on how fast you can peg those targets. This will increase your reaction time and eventually make it to where you can turn, aim, and shoot before your enemy can acknowledge what's happening. (Only do this is you have an enclosed backyard that is away from public view or your neighborhood is aware and okay with you doing it.)\n\n, Scopes are for DMRS, Gunners and Snipers. Red dots are very useful for those shots where it really matters if you hit them the first time! (Always Zero your sight)\n\n, One of the most adrenaline pumping scenarios is when the match starts and then, 20 seconds later, all you can hear is AEG sounding like humming birds on stimulants. Run into a good position and take cover. Remember the enemy also has a limited amount of ammunition so let them take those shots that they think will go through the concrete wall you're hiding behind.\n\n, If you don't, you run the risk of them not saying they didn't feel shot, whether or not this is true. If they cheat, don't overshoot or \"light them up.\" Confront them or a game organizer afterward.\n\n, This way, you can sometimes get behind enemy lines and shoot them. Also, play a game called rabbit where you have a 2v.1 and you are the 1. One person chases you ten seconds after you start running and the 2nd person helps the person chasing you (note: you are DISARMED). Avoid their shots and go to a certain location where your gun is. If you get hit the game is over. The way I play with my friends is when their mag is empty the game is over. In other words they can (but should not) light you up!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118975}
{"text":" One symptom you'll notice immediately is a change in your energy levels and recovery time. If you are over exercising you'll see a decrease in energy and an increase in the amount of time you need to recover from certain exercises.If you're noticing an overall lack of energy or inability to complete your normal workouts, this is a sign you need a rest.\nAlso, if you notice continued muscle soreness (past the 72 hour mark), this is a signal your muscles have not recovered or repaired themselves. You'll need to continue with rest until the soreness resolves completely.If you have increased injuries or an injury that won't heal, take a rest and definitely go see a doctor to diagnose the issue.\nIf you notice muscle pain while you are exercising, you may not have gotten enough rest in between exercise days.;\n, One obvious sign of exercising too much is a disrupted sleep pattern. This is one of the first signs you may notice. Either sleeping too much or experiencing insomnia is a sign that you might be pushing yourself too much.First, start by figuring out how much sleep you typically get on a \"good night.\" Do you sleep eight hours or a little more or less? This will be your norm and the basis for you to judge whether or not your sleep habits have changed.\nMany people start to notice they're having difficulty sleeping or they're experiencing some insomnia.Insomnia is defined as having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.Studies have shown that too much exercise may increase stress hormones in your body preventing you from falling or staying asleep.On the other hand, you may notice that you experience increased fatigue and increased desire to sleep longer or more often during the day. If you're staying in bed for nine, 10 or more hours, you may be exercising too much.\n\n, You may not realize how your mood, mental state or motivation is affected by over exercising. Any changes to your typical personality may also be a sign you've put in too much time at the gym.Changes in mood or feeling depressed are associated with overtraining. If you notice you've been snappy more often, feeling \"blue\" or have just been more irritable, take a look at how much you've been exercising.Another thing to track along with mood is your feelings about working out. Are you losing your motivation or usual excitement for your regular workouts? A sudden drop in motivation or excitement about your workout is a sign to give it a rest., If you're an exercise aficionado, you may take joy in measuring your heart rate during exercise, during your daily activities and during rest. Seeing an increase in resting heart rate is a sure sign you're overdoing it.Resting heart rate is when you're being calm, still and lying down. It's when your body needs the least amount of blood to be pumped through your body because you're at rest. Typically it's anywhere from 60-100 beats per minute. Athletes may have resting heart rates even lower at 40 beats per minute.If you have a heart rate monitor, or check your pulse regularly, try to monitor your resting heart rate more closely. If your normal rate is around 45 beats per minute and then jumps to 60 beats per minute, this is a sign you're definitely overdoing it.This indicates excessive stress on the body.\nIf you don't currently measure your resting heart rate, start doing so. It's best to measure first thing in the morning while you're still laying down or after you've been in a bed a bit at night. Track this in your exercise journal so you can see any trends or changes.\n\n, Over exercising can lead to a lack of monthly periods, as it can interfere with hormone production. This is called Exercise Induced Amenorrhea.You may stop having your period altogether or it may become irregular, though perhaps relating to how intensely you are exercising at the time.The interference with your hormones can have a negative affect on your bone mass, putting you at higher risk for sprains, breaks, and osteoporosis.See your doctor immediately if this happens.\n\n, Many avid exercisers and athletes will track their progress and performance. Whether it's strength or endurance, you should know what your goals are and how you typically perform day to day.\n\n\nPay attention to your overall performance. If your typical workouts feel harder to complete or you're running out of energy before the end of your workout, this could signal your body can't keep up this level of exercise.\nAlso, if you're trying to increase muscle mass, strength or endurance and your progress has completed halted (or regressed) this is a signal you're pushing yourself too much.Be careful not to continue to overdo it. You may think this progress stall is a signal to work harder, but that can be dangerous.\nWeight is another way to check in with your body. If you've been trying to lose weight but your weight has plateaued for several weeks, it may be due to too much exercise and not enough fuel., Although exercise is definitely a healthy thing to do, many people exercise for the wrong reasons. If exercise has become compulsive, or to help reach an extremely low body weight, you may need to give up working out and work on positive body image instead.\n\n\nSome people may exercise excessively and over train because they are using intense and frequent quantities of exercise as a method of \"purging\" after eating large meals or high calorie foods. Exercise bulimia is a mental health problem and if you believe (or others have mentioned to you) that you have exercise bulimia see a therapist and your doctor immediately.Many other people over train in the hopes of reaching the \"perfect body\" or \"perfect weight.\" If you feel like you're using exercise to change your body and you're dissatisfied with yourself, you may want to consider seeking help to improve your body image.\nIf your friends or loved ones have expressed concern on the amount and intensity of physical activity you're doing take a step back to look at your routine. Keep an objective view and use your support group to decide whether or not you should seek mental health help and discontinue with activity.\n\n, If you think you've been overtraining or over exercising, its time for a break and a visit to the doctor. This is especially true if you're experiencing any symptoms of overtraining or are eager to restart an exercise routine.\n\n\nIf you think you may be overdoing it or want to know what is safe and appropriate for your health and fitness level, think about talking to your doctor. She will be able to guide you on what's best.\nAlways see a doctor immediately if you start to notice any symptoms of overtraining. They usually worsen as you continue to push yourself which can be dangerous.\n\n, It's great to be active regularly and get in a lot of physical activity \u2014 especially cardiovascular exercises (like jogging, swimming or using the elliptical machine). However, try to stick to the typical recommended amounts to avoid exercising too much.\n\n\nMost health professionals recommended completing at least 150 minutes of cardio exercises each week. That's equivalent to five 30 minute sessions per week.If you want to do more exercise, it's safe to even participate in up to 300 minutes per week or about 60 minutes five to six days a week.There is no additional benefit of including more cardio exercise exceeding 300 minutes or an hour daily. Although you may be able to sustain this for a while, it could lead to over exercising.\n\n, In addition to cardiovascular exercises, it's also recommended to do a few days of strength training as well. Like cardio, you do not need to do large amounts to get results.\n\n\nMost health professionals only recommend doing strength training about one to two days a week. It's important to work every major muscle group and spend at least 20 minutes per session.If you're looking to significantly increase muscle mass, muscle strength or muscle definition, you'll most likely want to do more strength training than two 20 minute sessions each week. You can spend more time doing activities, but discontinue once you feel your muscles begin to fatigue.\nHowever, you can see decent results without spending two hours in the weight room. Most people are able to see changes in muscle strength and definition with two or three 20 or 30 minute weight sessions., Light exercise before and after your workout may help you recover faster. The goal is to perform at least five to 10 minutes of light cardio exercise before and after your workout, such as walking. This helps increase heat and circulation to the body and helps prevent injury.\n\n, If you want to be more active and be more fit, it's not always wise to just continue to add minutes to your cardio or strength routine. Mix it up by incorporating more lifestyle activity to maintain or improve your fitness levels.\n\n\nLifestyle activity doesn't include your exercises at the gym or your morning runs. Lifestyle activity are the exercises you do as part of your daily routine. It could be sweeping the floor, taking the stairs to your office or walking outside to get the newspaper.Lifestyle activities do not burn many calories by themselves. However, they can make a big difference by the end of an entire day.\nStudies have even shown that those who participate in a lot of lifestyle activity see similar health benefits compared to those who only do structured exercise (like going for a 45 minute run).If you want to keep your body active, burn calories, support your metabolism and see some health benefits without over exercising, consider increasing your lifestyle activity. Try: parking farther away, taking the stairs more often, walking or biking to work, standing instead of sitting while you watch TV or taking a 10 minute walk break on your lunch.\n\n, A great thing to have handy (for a whole host of reasons) is an exercise journal. This allows you to have a detailed log of the types, amounts and frequency of exercises you've done over the last several weeks. Use this to see if you've pushed yourself too much and when you need to take a break from exercise.\n\n\nKeep a paper dairy or use an online app to track all of your exercise. Make sure to track what days you're exercising, what types of exercises you're performing, how long you're doing them and at what intensity.\nAlso track any symptoms as well. For example, you did your normal weight lifting routine, but had difficulty finishing the last set of reps. Or you did your normal five mile jog, but couldn't finish the last mile.\nIf you're already noticing some signs and symptoms of overtraining, try to backtrack and log exercises you've done in the last several weeks. Try to fill in as many days as you can so you can get an accurate look of what you've been doing.\n\n, If you think it's time for a break from your normal exercise routine, don't think you have to stop being active completely. Instead, indulge in low intensity and restorative exercises.\n\n\nLow intensity and restorative exercises allow your body to be active, but are easy on your muscles, joints, heart and mind. Many exercises fall into this category and can help keep you active without further damaging your body.\nRestorative yoga is a great practice to start. You may even want to include this once a week to make sure you don't over train in the future. This type of yoga only includes five to six poses and typically use props to help your body relax. It's only light twisting. There aren't any muscle straining or strengthening exercises.You may also want to consider doing a few different types of low intensity exercises. You might want to go for a 20 minute walk, do some light swimming or do a slow pace on the elliptical.\n\n, You may not realize it, but taking some rest days each week is equally important to your overall health and fitness ability. In addition, you may see little to no progress without adequate rest days.Rest days are important for a whole variety of reasons. First, it's during rest that your muscles recover. Therefore, it's actually during rest that they grow in strength and size.Adequate rest is also important mentally. Give your mind a break from intense exercise so you can relax and enjoy your time away from the gym.\nTake at least one day of rest, maybe two each week. You can skip exercise all together or take some time for more restorative exercises.\nIt is recommended that you take at least 48 hours rest between workouts for the same body part. However, this is not fixed for everybody. If you find yourself overtraining, you may require up to 72 hours of rest before you exercise the same body part. Pay attention to recovery, mood and pain to assess how long your rest should be.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118976}
{"text":" Be aware that there are many types of gaited horses that vary considerably. Here are just a few of the most popular:\n\n\nAmerican Saddlebred - known for stylish presence and gentleness\nMissouri Fox Trotter - known for its stamina, useful for trail riding or ranch work\nPaso Fino - varies by kind, but can be favored for shows or trail rides\nTennessee Walker - has a flashy movement, but calm disposition;\n, Once you've decided what kind of gaited horse you'd like to ride, find someone that offers lessons with the specific kind of horse you've chosen.\n\n\nTaking lessons from an instructor can help you become more comfortable with your horse, safer on the trails, and a better rider in general. Don't assume that lessons only teach show tricks., At the stables, look for a gaited horse that is gentle, already trained to carry a rider, and has been used for trails.\n\n\nPick a horse that you connect with and you won't regret it. A happy horse won't try to throw its rider or impatiently mouth the bit at all times. Riding should be an enjoyable experience for horse and rider.\n\n, Some gaited horses tend to have high withers so you might need to purchase a saddle with a high swell on the front. It can be very uncomfortable for any horse to wear an improperly fitting saddle.\n\n\nThe ridge between the horse's shoulder blades is the withers. Set the saddle slightly forward over the withers, then let slip it back till it seems to come to a natural stop. Your horse should not mind wearing the saddle; if it shows discomfort, readjust the saddle., Choose gear that is the most comfortable for your individual horse. Don't choose a bit based on breed or gait.Get advice from a professional or ask the previous owners what bit they used. Try a few different ones till you discover what your horse prefers.\nIf you're taking lessons or just riding at a stable, chances are you won't need to worry about the headstall, bit, or saddle. They'll already be chosen and the horse will be used to the equipment.\n\n, Stand next to your horse or on your mounting block and hold the reins in your left hand. Place your left foot in the stirrup and swing your right leg over the horse. Gently lower yourself into the saddle.\n\n\nIf someone is giving you a leg-up, place your left foot into the stirrup and hold the front of the saddle, or pommel. Pull yourself up and swing your leg over before gently lowering yourself into the saddle.\n\n, Avoid the urge to grip your horse with your legs. This will send confusing messages to your horse. Your legs should gently touch the horse's sides while your knees are bent and your heels are lower than your toes.If you find yourself continuing to grip the sides of the horse with your legs, check to make sure your stirrups are properly adjusted.\n\n, This will evenly distribute your weight, making it easier for your horse to carry you. You should be able to imagine a straight line running from your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel.If you are out of alignment, your horse will find it difficult to carry you for long. You may notice your horse becoming uncomfortable or changing his gait to accommodate you.\n\n, While your back should be straight, make sure not to arch your spine. The curved spine will make you sit too far forward which can tire you and your horse.An arched spine can lead to overall tension.\n\n\nWhen you're tense, your horse will become tense as well. This can cause it to speed up or run off and make you unnecessarily tired and sore., This may seem like a strange way to begin riding, but realize that your horse will pick up on any tension or anxiety. When you're relaxed, your horse will relax too, allowing its joints and muscles to become more flexible.\n\n, This lets your horse know that you're there. Be sure not to pull tightly on the reins, though. The horse will need space in order to move its head.\n\n\nUse gentle hands to communicate through the reins. Work with a bit of slack in the reins. Your horse will pick up on the slight vibrations in the reins.If you constantly pull on your horse, it will become desensitized.\n\n, Use your pelvic muscles to suggest a direction to your horse. Drive your pelvis forward or backward to encourage your horse in those directions.Developing these cues will take time and practice. Keep working with your horse to create this intuitive method of instruction.\n\n, Use simple verbal cues to back up physical cues. For example, you can encourage your horse to move and stop by saying, \"walk,\" \"whoa,\" or \"ho.\"\n\n\nBe consistent in giving verbal directions. You should also give positive encouragement and support when your horse follows through with a direction. You can say, \"good horse\/boy\/girl,\" or rub its neck.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118977}
{"text":" The hips are ball and socket joints that help your legs move. Focusing on hip stretching can give you better range of motion in your legs. There are a number of hip stretches, including the hip flexor stretch, the hip rotator stretch, the floor hip stretch and the hip abductor stretch. To do the hip flexor stretch:Kneel on your right knee and put your opposite foot on the floor. Your opposite hip and knee should rest at a 90 degree angle.\nPush your right hip forward until it is over your right knee. Keep your hands on your hips. Keep your back straight and your chest pushing forward.\nBreathe into the stretch until you feel some tension in your hips. Hold the stretch for 15-60 seconds. Release the stretch switch to the other side. Repeat stretches on each side for a total of 5 times. Do these sets a couple of times every day.;\n, The hamstrings are the muscles along the backside of your thighs. There are a number of ways to stretch these muscles; these exercises usually require some resistance or support surface to enable a good stretch, such as a doorway and wall, a table, a ballet barre, or the floor. To do a doorway stretch:Lie on the floor next to a doorway. Rest one leg flat on the floor through a doorway. Rest the other leg against the wall next to the doorway.\nStart inching your body slowly toward the wall so that your leg is pushed against the wall. You should start to feel some tension in your hamstring muscle.\nHold the stretch for 15-60 seconds. Release the stretch switch to the other side. Repeat stretches on each side for a total of 5 times. Do these sets a couple of times every day.\nOnce you are able to do this stretch, try other hamstring stretches that require you to move your leg up higher or stretch it further, such as stretching your leg onto a table or sitting on the floor and stretching your hamstrings.\n\n, Turnout exercises, also known as \u201cbutterfly\u201d or \u201cfroggie\u201d stretches, require that your legs bend out to the sides of your body, rotating at the hips. Turndowns are often performed by ballet dancers, but they are also useful for climbers and other athletes. They can help improve your leg flexibility. To do a turnout exercise:Sit on the floor with the soles of your feet together so that your legs form a diamond shape in front of you.\nHold onto your ankles and rest your elbows on your legs. Gently press down on your thighs with your elbows. Make sure that your arms are not resting on your knees at all; you can risk knee injury doing that.\nStretch until you feel mild tension in your inner thigh and groin area. Hold the position for 10-20 seconds and release. Stretch again for a slightly longer stretch, this time for 20-30 seconds.\nLie back so that your back rests on the floor. Keep your legs in their position. Let your knees fall down towards the ground. Make sure the soles of your feet are still together. Hold this pose for 30-60 seconds. Repeat this set a few times every day.\n\n, After you have improved your flexibility to move your leg upwards, start stretching it against a wall. Put your foot against a wall and inch your body closer to the wall so that your leg moves upward little by little. Hold onto a chair or table for balance.\n\n\nHave bare feet during this exercise, as socks may make your feet a little too slippery. You can risk injury if your foot slips up too quickly.\nPractice with the other leg as well, so that you will be equally flexible on each side of your body.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118978}
{"text":" Heavy bags come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can weigh between 20 and 100 lbs (9 and 45 kgs). They can range from 2 feet (.6 meters) in diameter to 4 (1.2 meters) or more. Ultimately, you need to decide what type of bag is best for you. Some examples of bags include:\n\n\nA conventional heavy bag. These are large bags that you can punch, kick, or run into.\nMaize bags. These bags are tear shaped or round, filled with corn, and are great for practicing different types of punches.\nAn angle heavy bag. These bags are similar to a conventional bag, but the upper half of the bag has a larger diameter. These bags are good for uppercuts and other angled punches.;\n, The location you pick should be one that will allow you to move around the bag. As a result, avoid picking a spot up against a wall or next to a column. The best place to hang your bag is in a large area, at least 10 feet by 10 feet (3 meters by 3 meters), and preferably larger.Ideal places to hang your bag are garages, large recreation rooms, or on a porch or patio.\n\n, The place you choose to hang the bag should be able to support whatever weight bag you choose. It can either be a wooden or metal rafter, or a hook that is capable of supporting a lot of weight.\n\n\nInstall a hook into a support beam in your ceiling. You can purchase heavy bag ceiling hooks at sporting goods stores or online.\nTie your heavy bag to an exposed wooden or metal rafter or beam.\nPurchase a freestanding hanger. The benefit of freestanding hangers is that you won\u2019t need to install a hook into your ceiling or do anything invasive in your home. The downside is that you won\u2019t be able to move completely around your bag.\nUse a door jamb pull-up bar to hang your heavy bag., While you can punch your bag without gloves, it is best to use the opportunity to get used to how they feel. In addition, using gloves will soften the impact and possibly prevent hand injuries.Even if you don't box, you should use boxing gloves when punching a heavy bag.\n\n, Your knees should be bent a little bit and your weight should rest on the balls of your feet. This will enable you to move around the bag quicker.\n\n\nBy bending your knees, you'll also be better able to safely absorb impact if and when you do box someone., Your feet should be separated by the width of your shoulders. If you don\u2019t stand like this, you won\u2019t be balanced and may fall. In addition, you won\u2019t be able to direct as much power as you need into the punching bag.\n\n\nThe perfect stance may vary for some people. You may be more comfortable a few inches shorter or wider than your shoulder width. Experiment until you find the perfect way to stand., Your elbows should be tucked in tightly next to your body. This will make it easier for you to defend yourself if you ever box another person. Tucked elbows protect not only your arms but your torso., When hitting your bag, your default stance should be one when your fists are raised in front of you with one slightly higher than the other. When in this stance, your fists should not be tight and your thumbs should not be tucked in under other fingers.\n\n\nKeep your fists relaxed until you go in for a punch., When connecting with the bag, your fists should be raised. Punch the bag and let your fist recoil back to you after it connects with the bag. Ideally, you want to let the rebound of the impact send your fist back toward your body., When punching, never fully extend your arms (or legs). This could cause tendon and ligament problems, fractured bones, or broken bones. Instead, allow your arms to remain bent slightly. If you need to get closer to the bag, do so.\n\n\nYour elbows (or knees) should never lock completely.\n\n, While it\u2019s okay to do single punches, sometimes you may want to practice with a series of punches. To do this, throw one punch and quickly follow it with another punch or two. You can choose to punch with the same fist or to alternate.\n\n\nTo time your punches appropriately, think of three punches making a \u201crat-ta-tat\u201d noise., After delivering a sequence of punches, pause briefly. Your pause can range from one to three seconds, but should not exceed three seconds., As you deliver single punches or sequences of punches, you should move around the bag in a relaxed manner. Punching in a relaxed manner will get you a better cardio workout and improve your agility.You can choose to move in a clockwise, counterclockwise, or back-and-forth pattern.\n\n, Although you want to move around the bag, don\u2019t run or jump around it. Running or jumping around the bag will waste energy and tire you out. In addition, you could learn bad habits, make missteps, and hurt yourself., Alternate hands and punch your bag twenty times. Break these up into sequences or deliver single punches -- whatever you prefer. The most important thing is that you use your routine to perfect single or sequenced punches.\n\n\nMake sure to keep your guard up while delivering punches to the bag., Aim to hit the right side of your bag. Swing your left arm in a long-arched fashion to make the hit. Withdraw a few steps from the bag after delivering your punch. Then, complete four more left hooks., Take aim at the left side of your bag. Then, take your right arm, extend it in an arch, and hit the bag. Just like with the left hook, you should withdraw a few steps after delivering the punch. After you\u2019ve completed one, reengage the bag and complete four more right hooks., Aim for the lower portion of the bag. Decide which foot you want to kick with, then turn slightly on your support hip so your kicking leg is closer to the bag. Then, turn your hip, raise your foot, and kick the bag.\n\n\nComplete five repetitions with each leg., Aim for the top half of the heavy bag. Envision an opponent\u2019s head. Raise your hands to guard your chin. Pivot slightly so your kicking leg is closer to the bag, raise your leg high, and make contact with the bag.\n\n\nComplete five repetitions with each leg., Choose the leg you want to kick with. Then, pivot slightly on your hip and the ball of your foot. Lift your leg and deliver a blow to the middle section of the bag.Switch legs and do five more repetitions with the opposite leg.\n\n, Stand one foot in front of the bag with your legs spread shoulder length. Dip your knees down slightly. Then, raise one knee and use it to strike the bag. You should make contact with the middle of the bag.\n\n\nComplete five repetitions with each knee.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118979}
{"text":" You might be able to do this by hand if the ring is fairly thin, but for 14 gauge rings and thicker, you might struggle to open and close the ring. If that happens, you can use captive ring opening\/closing pliers. Softly pick up one side of the ring with your pliers and hold the other side with your hands, then bend and twist carefully., The bead or ball of a captive ring is held in place using nothing but pressure. When you release the pressure on both sides of the bead, it will fall out. Hold the ring on either side of the bead. With your hands or pliers, gently pull both sides of the ring in opposite directions, pulling them apart. Avoid stretching the ring open too far, since this could make it difficult to fit the ends back together.\n\n, After you remove the bead, twist the ring into a semi-spiral shape, so you can easily fit it into your piercing. Turn one end clockwise and the other counterclockwise, but do this as little as needed. If you twist the ring ends too far apart, you might have difficulty twisting them back together again.\n\n, Feed one end of the ring into the piercing hole on your nose. Gradually wind the ring further into the hole until the center rests inside the piercing and the opening lies directly below it.\n\n, The bead should have small dimples on either side. Fit the ends of the ring into these dimples by placing one side of the bead onto one end of the ring. Carefully twist the two ends toward each other again until they line up evenly. Then, push the second end onto the other side of the bead. Once the bead is snug and secure, the nose ring is set in place.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118980}
{"text":" It may help to visualize yourself doing the skill to completion before you get started.;\n, Beginning with whatever foot is most comfortable, take a few running steps. Most gymnasts find it easiest to take a quick hop with their weakest leg and their first running step with their stronger leg.Run just enough steps to reach speed necessary to complete the round-off and propel yourself into whatever move comes next, keeping in mind the space you need to complete your forward routine.\n\n\nFor best results, you should use the same number of steps each time you practice and perform a round-off.\n\n, You are preparing to put your hands on the ground for the round-off.\n\n, A hurdle is completed when you skip into your last step before you put your hands on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn gymnastics, a hurdle is the transitional motion between a run and setting up for a skill.Remember to hurdle out, not up.\nBend the knee you will use to step into the lunge and propel yourself into the round-off.\n\n, Bend your stronger leg so that if you were standing still you would be standing in a lunge position with your arms over your head. Then propel your body forward with the bent leg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn gymnastics, a lunge is the position used to initiate a tumbling or control skill.The lunge is recognizable because the front leg is bent and the back leg is straight.Keep your toes pointed straight ahead. If you toes are pointed left or right, your round-off will go in the opposite direction.\n\n, This will help to make your round off better and more powerful.\n\n, Lifting your head will disturb your balance and momentum and tucking it too close to your body will cause you to over-rotate your round-off.\n\n, When making a round-off, the first hand goes down just like in a cartwheel, but the second hand is placed down almost perpendicular to the first, so that it can propel your body 180 degrees.\n\n\nImagine a sideways \"T\" when placing your hands on the floor. The first hand you put down should be horizontal and the second hand vertical to achieve this \"T.\"\nMake sure you don't leap into the round off. Your second foot should not leave the floor before the first hand contacts the floor., If your body represents a clock, you would bring your legs together in the 1 o'clock position.\n\n\nSnap your legs together as quickly as you can, but do not smack your heels together. Smashing your heels together could cause a points deduction in competition.\n\n, If you got a good running start and brought your legs together as you began coming down from the round-off, you will have the momentum necessary to push off the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This means you will bend at the waist, and your feet will be slightly lower than your hips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people make the mistake of piking or tucking their legs and letting their feet touch the ground while their hands are still on it. Push off hard with your hands, keeping your body banana shaped with feet before your hips, before your feet hit the ground., This will prepare you for any tumbling skills you want to connect with your round-off.\n\n\nBoth legs should finish at the same time, positioned together with your feet facing backward from their starting position.\n\n, This is the rebound, and the height you achieve will come from the power in your round-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf transitioning to another move, the rebound will propel you into it., The roundoff will often transition directly into a back handspring or a back tuck., If you have to take more than one backward step, you are off balance and need to work on your control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't land too deeply by taking too large a step backward, but a small step may help you absorb the landing so you do not hyper-extend and damage your knees.\nFor maximum points, stick your landing with your knees bent, arms up covering your ears and arch your back with your chest up and butt in.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118981}
{"text":" Everyone's body has tight areas and looser areas.\n\n\nStretching early and often helps keep you limber. Remember, you will become less flexible as you get older, so start early.;\n, Do you know where your Gluteus Maximus is? Probably! What about your Iliopsoas or your Semitendinosus? These muscles are important to your needle! You have to overextend your back, torso and leg muscles to do a needle. Learning the muscles' names and how they work within your body will make stretching for this position easier.\nTighter muscles are typical around the back and torso. These areas will need extra stretching., Muscles have a long memory. If you have injured a muscle, it might be tighter than the rest. Give it extra love and attention, and extra stretching to prevent future harm.\n\n\nMuscle tears can occur. If they do, they can reduce your motor skills, as well as create scar tissue. Be careful! , Do jumping jacks, brisk walking or jogging to warm up your muscles.\n\n\nDon't stretch with cold muscles. Working on a needle with cold muscles can hurt your posture and form, which may result in injury., A routine is important for preparing your body for exertion and contortions involved in doing a needle. Stretching prepares your body for the needle posture. Also, stretching triggers your muscle memory and believe it or not, can remember what to do! Remember, stretching is not itself a warm-up.\nStart with major muscle groups. Shoulders, torso, gluts, thighs, and back.\n\n, Breathing is key to the optimal performance of your mind and body.In the middle of a routine, you're exerting all of your energy and breathing is essential.With time, the resistance and tightness will release. Keep breathing!\n\n, It can take time to perfect the splits while on the floor. It can take even longer to do it with both legs! But, it's important to the needle posture, so don't rush this step.\n\n\nMost people have one leg that is more flexible than the other. But, stretch both legs equally.\nYour more flexible leg might end up being your supporting leg. If so, this is another reason to stretch both legs equally.\nAlternately point and flex your front leg's foot while in the splits.\nKeep your back leg's knee rolled towards the ground, not twisted to the side., Once you are in the splits on the floor, you need to stretch your chest, shoulders and back muscles. To do this, reach backwards and hold your back leg with both hands.\n\n\nBreathe calmly and regularly during this process.\n\n, Once you're comfortable with the splits on the floor, you need to move onto to gently hyper-extending your splits.\n\n\nPlace your front leg ankle and heel on a few inches of gymnastic mat, rolled up yoga mat, yoga block, or even a rolled up towel, and descend into the split position.\nGradually increase the height of the mat, block or rolled towel until you have flexibility and no discomfort while hyperextended.\n\n, This motion results in the posture that you'll have in the needle while standing up, except here you are supported by the ground.\n\n\nCheck in with your body and see if how it feels to move into this position slowly, and don't forget to be patient if you encounter tightness in your muscles.\nContinue leaning backwards until you can do so without discomfort. Remember that this is the posture you must acquire to do a needle.\n\n, This is the same posture you were in on the floor, but this time you are balancing while standing upright.\n\n\nUse the doorframe as a buttress for your upper leg and body.\nDepending on where you place your standing leg, you can increase or decrease the stretch and hyperextension.\n\n, Do this with your hands overhead while in the splits.\n\n\nAgain, take it slowly here, since you are using different muscles when you're standing versus sitting on the floor.\n\n, Sink into the splits, or the hyperextended splits, while holding onto your upper leg with both hands behind you.\n\n\nThis is the posture that most closely approximates the free-standing needle, so take your time in perfecting your balance and comfort.\nTake your time and be patient!\n\n, This is the correct posture for kicking into the needle and will minimize injury.\n\n\nDo not transform a scorpion into a needle as the way to get into the needle position.\nThough it may be easier for stretching, moving from a scorpion into a needle will twist and tweak your posture and balance, making injury more likely.\nGoing from a scorpion into a needle also takes longer and shifts your balance. This is not good when you're up in the air!\n\n, Aligning your shoulders and hips is essential for elegant, energized posture in the needle.\n\n, Kicking off of the ground with a strong punch sweeps your leg all the way towards the back of your head. It can be difficult to do this motion at the beginning. If it is, try holding your leg out in front of you at a forty-five degree angle and let gravity help you to get enough momentum to kick the leg higher and higher., Once you've caught your leg, re-point foot and toe, and smile!\n\n\nLuckily you have two hands to catch this wild leg, so at first touch, grab on tight, expand your chest and drop your shoulders, and show them your smile!\n\n, If you have more than a millisecond that you need to hold the needle, balance yourself, breathe, and relax into the position.\n\n, Breathing deeply keeps you calm and centered in this difficult posture, and allows you to function optimally during the stunt., This is a tried and true tip from the ballet world, called \"spotting,\" which results in activating your core and refocusing your center of gravity while spinning or in the air.\"Spotting\" prevents loss of balance and centers your posture.\n\n, Remember that you'll be in the needle in unpredictable circumstances: perhaps you'll be moving sideways or dismount with a twist.\n\n, Wearing different shoes, including shoes other than your cheerleading shoes, changes the placement of your toes, the ball of your foot and heel, which mimics the movement of your foot while it's in the hands of your bases.\n\n\nBetter to practice ahead of time so that you can handle all sorts of circumstances.\n\n, Or, do both at the same time and grab a friend to video your technique.\n\n\nLook over the footage together to see what looks good, what doesn't and tweak your performance so that your needle looks strong, elegant and flawless.\n\n, Depending on your body, this posture will continue to challenge you, so don't stop challenging yourself while stretching.\n\n, Practice, practice, practice, and repeat as many steps as necessary.\n\n, This puts an exclamation point (!) on your impressive needle, and energizes your body for the release and dismount.\n\n, There is no need to make this more forceful than it will already be.\n\n\nRemember, you have tension and gravity to help you, so try to make your dismount elegant.\n\n, Stand up tall, bring your hands down to your side, and extend and straighten leg as it descends.\n\n, Remember how gymnasts who vault always have trouble sticking the landing? Take your performance to the next level by releasing the needle with control and certainty, bringing both feet together and standing tall, with a smile, of course!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118982}

Keep going until you've done as many pushups as you can.;\n, Downward dog is a simple yoga position that can help build strength. It can easily be done in the nude. To start, stand on all fours. Have your hands under your elbows and your fingertips facing forward.Push your legs and feet backwards until you're in a plank position. Stand on your tiptoes to lift your body off the ground. Then, shift your weight backwards and raise your hips until your body forms a v-position. Keep your head aligned with your spine. Exhale as you move your body upward.\nThen, inhale and return to the starting position. Do as many repetitions as are comfortable for you.\n\n, To start, lie on your right side.

Keep your head aligned with your spine.Lift your hips off the ground as you exhale. Keep your head and spine aligned.\nReturn to the starting position as you inhale. Do as many repetitions that are comfortable to you, and then repeat on the other side.\n\n, This activity requires a bit more movement, so it can help raise your heart rate slightly. To start, stand up straight with your feet hip length apart. Keep your arms at your side, with your shoulder blades pulled down slightly.Crouch downward by shifting your hips and back down and bending your knees. Keep lowering yourself until your heels nearly hit the floor.\nThen, quickly launch yourself into the air.

Then, repeat.\n\n, To start, stand with your feet together and shoulders pulled back. Lift up one foot and briefly balance on one leg. Then, step forward and land on your raised foot.Lower your body until you feel discomfort. Try to get your thigh parallel to the floor.\nPush off the ground with the leg you lifted. Return to the starting position. Repeat the movement with your other leg.\n\n, As you likely do not want your neighbors peeking in on you exercising in the nude, keep any blinds or curtains in your home closed. This is especially important if you live in a home where it's difficult to avoid windows.Curtains generally shut out more than blinds. If possible, exercise in an area of your home near curtains.\nIf you have a spot in your home away from windows altogether, like a basement, opt to exercise there.\n\n, If you have somewhat flimsy blinds, you may want some extra coverage from prying eyes. Plant life can help shut out the outside view. If there's a window near a tree, shrub, or other type of foliage, opt to exercise here.The bigger and bushier the plants, the more privacy you will get.\n\n, If you have a courtyard or backyard in your home, you may want to exercise by a window looking over this space. You're less likely to get random people walking through a courtyard or backyard than the street.However, if you live in an apartment complex, your neighbors may frequently walk through the courtyard. In this case, it may be better to work out elsewhere.\n\n, If your home is surrounded by fences or walls, opt to workout near windows overlooking such obstructions. This will limit people walking by from seeing into your home., As yoga is a fairly low intensity activity, many areas offer nude yoga classes. Many people enjoy such classes as they get used to being naked in the presence of others, helping with body acceptance, and they also have an instructor guide them through a routine.You can look online for nude classes in your area. If there are any gyms or spas that are clothing-optional, you may find nude yoga classes here.\nIf you can't find a nude class, you can always do a yoga routine from your home while naked.\n\n, There may be spas in your area that are clothing optional. Many spas have exercise classes, such as yoga, and may also have gyms and gym equipment. If you want to go somewhere to work out naked, look into a day pass at a nude spa.Spas may have rules regarding how to use equipment when naked, so make sure you follow all rules. You may, for example, not be allowed to use certain workout equipment while naked.\n\n, If you want to do something like water aerobics, there may be a nude beach near you. There are many nude beaches in the United States and other countries. This can be a great place to work out nude.In the United States, there are nude beaches in many states. Texas, Oregon, California, and Hawaii, for example, are all home to nude beaches.\n\n, Working on naked requires the same basic workout safety as any other exercise routine. Prior to working out, warm up. After you're done, cool down.A warm up is generally some light activity prior to a workout routine. You can pace for about 10 minutes in your home, or do 10 minutes of light stretching.\nTo cool down, repeat the same process. Do about 10 minutes of lighter activity.\n\n, Sports bras can help support your breasts during a workout routine. They help keep your weight supported, allowing for better posture during a workout. If your breasts are sensitive due to pregnancy or breastfeeding, a sport bra may be necessary.If working out nude is important to you, you don't have to wear a sports bra. For lower intensity activities, like yoga or Pilates, a sports bra is probably not necessary.\nHowever, if you're doing more vigorous cardio, your body may benefit from the support of a sports bra. If your breasts start to feel sore during a workout, you may want to throw on at least a sports bra for your routine.\n\n, Jockstraps and athletic underwear support sensitive areas of the body, serving a similar function to sports bras. You may need the support of athletic underwear or a jockstrap if you're engaging in vigorous activity in the nude. If you start to feel sore, buy underwear or a jockstrap., When working out in the nude, you should remain in tune with your body. Overexertion can lead to injury. With a new workout routine, pay attention to signs your body needs to rest and recuperate.If you feel faint after a workout, cut back the next day.\nIf a workout leaves you with aches and pains that persist for days, you need to cut back slightly on the intensity.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118983}
{"text":" You will need: A needle (pre sterile!), alcohol swabs, a curved barbell, and the correct type of clamp.;\n, The needle should be sterile. Cannula needles (most often used in piercing parlours in the UK and in hospitals) usually arrive in an autoclave pouch. There is no safe way to sterilise needles or equipment at home without an autoclave, so only order autoclaved materials. Get an alcohol wipe and clean the inside of the nose on the cartilage you will pierce. Find the 'soft spot' which is located near the tip of the nose and where the cartilage is thinner.\n\n, Unless you have a high pain tolerance you will need to numb your nose or else it will hurt more. Using ice is not an appropriate way to numb a septum, and using a hospital-grade numbing spray has a tendency to not work on septum piercings, even if held on the area for a long time.\n\n, Septums are considered one of the most painful piercings, and if you hold the clamp down hard enough you may be able to numb some of the pain. With the clamp in place, put the needle through one side of the nose, and in one smooth and quick motion, push it through. If you used a cannula needle, remove the needle and keep the cannula inside the piercing, and trim to size. Hopefully you used a good needle, which is hollow. Place the jewellery inside the piercing however you have to depending on the needle you used.\n\n, If you used a hollow point needle or cannula, as you pull the needle out you should have the one side of the barbell in your nose.

{"text":" It's common knowledge among those in the body modification community that there is a right way and a wrong way to get a piercing done. You want to go to a place that has a good standing reputation with experienced piercers. If you take the time and effort to visit a professional, your piercing has a much better chance of healing correctly and faster. Also, professional piercers will offer expert advice to help you take care of your piercing after you leave. Some things to ensure you have a safe piercing include:\n\n\nA hollow piercing needle. Professional body piercers use these needles because they're hygienic and easy to control, for straight and properly-placed piercings that heal quickly.Avoid piercing guns. Using a nose piercing gun is likely to cause more pain and aren't normally used for nose piercings because they can be less accurate. Besides, since piercing guns are sometimes harder to clean, they can easily transfer blood-borne infections.;\n, You want to wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap anytime you touch and handle your piercing. Your face already has oils on it, and those oils, along with the secretions coming from your freshly pierced nose (clear fluids, sometimes blood), and dirt on your hands, can lead to an infection.\n\n, Once you are pierced, you shouldn't remove the jewelry from your nose for at least 6-8 weeks, which is considered the normal healing time. The only time you should remove the original jewelry, is if there is something wrong with the size or material of the jewelry.If you want to change your jewelry while your piercing is still healing stage (6-8 weeks after the initial piercing), you should contact your piercer and have them do it for you.\n\n, You want to be gentle with your new piercing. First, your should use a cotton ball or q-tip with water to wipe off any built up crust that may have formed. While initially you might think cleaning with alcohol or peroxide would kill all of the bacterial cells, they also happen to kill the healing cells in and on your nose, so don't use those harsh cleaners. A safe and easy way to clean a new piercing is by using a saline solution. Sea salt dissolved in water is a gentle and effective saline solution. You can soak a cotton ball or q-tip in the saline solution, or you can soak your nose piercing in a bigger bowl of the saline solution. If you soak your nose piercing, you should soak it for 5-10 minutes at least once a day.After your soak, you can rinse your nose with clean water to remove any leftover saline solution. To make this saline solution at home you will need:\n\n\n1\/4 teaspoon of non-iodized (iodine-free) sea salt.\n1 cup (8 oz.) of warm distilled or bottled water.\n\n, Sometime a piercing will obviously be infected. Other times, the infection might not be so easy to identify. When you first get a piercing done, there might be some initial bleeding, swelling around the piercing site, sensitivity, bruising, itchy irritation, and a whitish-yellow discharge (which is not pus) coming from the piercing. This discharge can form some crust on the jewelry, but that crust formation is okay and normal. Knowing the difference between normal side effects after having a piercing done, and infection side effects, can help you treat your infection better. Some of the most common signs that your piercing is infected is:\n\n\nPersistent itchiness and\/or redness that continues after the normal healing period.\nPersistent soreness and tenderness that continues after the normal healing period.\nA hot, burning sensation.\nYellow-green seepage of liquid, such as pus or blood, from the hole.\nBad smells coming from the piercing site., An infection and an allergic reaction have similar symptoms, so the best way to distinguish between the two is to know how they differ from one another: An allergic reaction is different from an infection, in that an allergic reaction includes a a severe burning feeling, a bigger hole from the initial piercing (as if the skin is trying to move away from the metal stem of the piercing), and a clearish-yellow discharge rather than a discharge that is yellow-greenish. If you think you are experiencing an allergic reaction, you should have your piercer change out the piercing jewelry immediately, and visit a doctor.Some metals can cause an allergic reaction, so it is best to use quality metal studs made from things like surgical steel, titanium, platinum, niobium, and gold if it is 14k or higher., Continuing to clean your piercing with soap and water or a saline solution will help to wash out the bacteria causing the infection. A nose piercing infection can be caused by a number of things such as the entry of outside pathogens (bacteria and fungi), wearing very tight jewelry, or unhygienic ways of living. Just be sure to keep cleaning your piercing regularly until it fully heals, (normally 6-8 weeks after getting it pierced).\n\n, If your infection site doesn't seem to be too bad, you can try curing it yourself at home before you visit the doctor. You can try things like:\n\n\n\nWarm saline compresses promote blood flow to the infected area (more blood means more infection fighting cells) which can promote healing the infection quicker.Cold compresses can help reduce swelling, aches, and pains near the infected piercing. Just like when you bang your knee on the corner of a coffee table, a cold compress can also help reduce bruising. Be sure to never apply ice directly to the site of your piercing. Direct contact with ice can cause skin damage. Be sure to always wrap a paper towel or some sort of cloth around the cold compress before putting it on the piercing area.Chamomile tea bag compress. Make a chamomile tea compress by dipping a chamomile tea bag into warm water. Let the bag steep in the water for about 20 seconds, and then apply the tea bag to the area of your piercing. Hold it there as a compress for about 10 minutes, or until the bag cools. Once the tea bag cools, dip the tea bag back into the warm water, and apply it as a compress again.Aspirin paste. Place a some aspirin into a glass (about 4-6 tablets) with very little water and allow some time for the aspirin to dissolve in the water and turn into a paste. Apply the aspirin paste onto the infection site before you go to bed every night, and look for signs of improvement with the infection. Since aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug, it can reduce the swelling, help heal your infection without much of a risk for irritation, and it still lets the infection site drain fluids., With regular cleaning you want to avoid harsh cleansers, but even more so with an infected piercing. People who have infected piercings should steer clear from substances like alcohol, tea tree oil, betadine, hydrogen peroxide and methylated spirits, because scar and bumps are more like to form around the infected piercing site with the use of these substances.The chemical strength of these substances can cause even more discomfort with burning sensations, and they kill off the good cells trying to fight the infection.\nOther anti-bacterial ointments can possibly prevent air flow from getting to the infected area and slow down healing, so if you use them, use them sparingly., If your infection doesn't clean up or get any better within a few days (a week maximum), the best thing you can do for your infected piercing is to take the details of your problem to a doctor. Dermatologists and general-practice physicians are your best choice; however, if you can't afford to visit a doctor's office or clinic, speaking to the person who did your piercing is your next best choice., Be careful when getting dressed and undressed. It can be very painful to catch a new piercing on your clothes when you're putting them on or taking them off. Give yourself an extra couple of minutes to get dressed so you can take your time, move carefully, and avoid snagging your nose ring on your clothes.\n\n\nSome people try to sleep on their opposite side of where their nose piercing is, or use a neck pillow so they don't irritate it in their sleep.\n\n, While your piercing is trying to heal, be sure to stay away from using lotions, makeup, or any face washes that could get into, and build up in the piercing hole. If you do get any products in the piercing, rinse the piercing with warm salt water or a saline solution., Water sources like lakes, public or private swimming pools, and hot tubs are all areas that could contain contaminants that can develop an infection for a newly pierced nose. If your nose piercing must come in contact with these potentially dangerous water sources, try to use a bandage that is fully water-proof, and completely seals the piercing. Bandages like these can be found at any local drugstore.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118986}

Move your arms back down.Your arms shouldn't be straight out in front of you or straight out to your sides. Rather, they should be in the middle between those two positions, at a forty-five degree angle.Repeat 12 times for one set. Do two sets.;\n, Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Your elbows should be in front of your body. Your palms should be facing upward, but slightly away from you as your arms start just below the 90-degree angle. Lift the dumbbells together upward toward your chest. Bring the dumbbells back down to the starting position.The weight is dependent on you. You should be able to do this exercise comfortably for about 12 repetitions. Start with 5 pounds in each hand if you don't know where to begin.Try to do 3 sets., Hold the same dumbbells out in front of you again with your arms at a 90-degree angle. However, your palms should face the floor. Push your arms down slowly until they reach your thighs, breathing out as you go. Hold the position for a second, then bring your arms back up, breathing in.You can use a small barbell instead of dumbbells.Try 3 sets of 10 repetitions.\nYou can also turn this move into tricep pull downs. All you do is flip your hands over so your palms are facing up. You use the same movement, going down towards your thighs.\n\n, Lay on your back on a bench. The bench should have supports to hold a barbell. Add weights, starting small. Put your hands semi-close together on the bar above you, about shoulder-width apart. Lift the bar off, and bring it straight down towards your chest slowly, while you breathe in. Push the bar back up as you breathe out.The close grip helps work your triceps more, which is important for throwing.Try repeating the exercise 8 times. Do 4 of these sets.\nIf you've never done this exercise before, it's good to have someone spot you.\n\n, Hold a medicine ball in front of you. Stand with a wall to your left or right. Turn toward the wall very quickly, and as you do, let the ball go.Repeat this exercise to improve arm strength.This exercise also works on your core strength. Try to keep those muscles tight as you move., Grab a partner. Place your throwing arm in the air at a 90-degree angle, but support it at the elbow with the glove on your other hand. Using just your wrist, toss the ball to the other person., Sit with your legs outward. Start with your arm in the air at a 90-degree angle, supported by the glove on your other hand.Start by using just your arm from the elbow up to throw the ball.Move on to twisting your whole torso while throwing, as well as your hips.Next, move up to one knee and practice twisting and throwing from that position. Try to throw across your knee (angle-wise).Finally, stand up, and keep focusing on following throw by twisting your torso. You can also add a crow hop, where you jump forward on your forward foot as you wind up., Outside of practice, you should be practicing throwing three times a week. You'll need to spend about 15-20 minutes throwing each time you practice, throwing at various distances.If your age is 7- to 12-years-old, spend four minutes on each of the following distances: 30 feet, 60 feet, and 90 feet.If you are 13- to 20-years-old, spend four minutes on each of the following distances: 30 feet, 60 feet, 90 feet, and 120 feet.Try to throw straight across the field instead of making them arc high. Don't throw with all your force, but you want to make a good line from where you are to who you're throwing to., This exercise works particularly well for little league players because it works the arm, as well as the rest of the body, but it can just be a fun activity to do with a friend or a parent. Simply get an appropriately sized football, such as a junior football for little leaguers, and grab a partner.Put the emphasis on targeting the ball. Make sure the ball is going into your partner's chest.Throw at least 15 to 20 times each time you choose this exercise., Lay face-down on the floor. The balls of your feet should be touching the floor, pushing your legs up slightly. Place your hands flat on the ground at shoulder-height. They should be just wider than shoulder width.

Lower yourself back down, still keeping your body straight.Try squeezing your glute muscles to help keep your body straight.You can also do this exercise with your hands balanced around an exercise ball., Start in a standing position. Take a large step forward, bending your back leg down as you step. The knee of your back leg should almost touch the ground but not actually reach it. Don't stop at the floor. Instead, keep going, bringing that leg forward and pushing the other leg down. Keep moving forward, alternating which leg goes towards the floor.Keep your front shin as straight as possible. Your knee should push forward to be in front of your toes.Lunges help work your leg muscles and lower body.\nYou can add dumbbells to increase the weight as you lunge. The dumbbells will also help strengthen your arms a bit as you move.\n\n, Start with your legs a couple of inches off the ground. Lean your torso back as well. You can hold a weight in front of you or simply work without one. Twist your body so that your hands touch the ground near one hip, then move to the other one. Keep moving back and forth. Make sure your feet don't touch the ground. You can cross your feet if it helps.Russian twists are great at building core strength.They especially work on the transverse abdominal muscles., Place the barbell on your shoulders. It should be across your traps. Your feet should be at least hip-width apart. You can angle them out if you want. Keeping your torso as straight as possible, bend your knees, lowering your self towards the ground. Your knees should come forward as you go. When you feel your thighs hit your calves, push back up until you're standing straight again.Your weight should stay on the front part of your heelYou can do a squat with or without a barbell.

{"text":" When you are deciding to start an exercise program, you should talk to your doctor and\/or a physical therapist about your plans. This is particularly important if you have mobility issues or trouble with physical activity, as your doctor can help you determine what is safe for you. No matter what your physical fitness level is, you can be more active and get on a program to strengthen your body.A physical therapist can help you come up with an exercise plan to help reduce your risk of falling.Your physical therapist may also assess your walking gait, which is the way you walk. He may provide exercises for you to perform to help your gait.Your physical therapist can also help you come up with activities to strengthen your lower body and improve your balance.;\n, Studies have found that exercise is successful in helping prevent falls.The more you exercise, the more effective it will be.When you exercise, you strengthen your muscles and bones. Strong muscles will support you during your daily activities (from going up the stairs to getting up from a seated position), and stronger bones make it less likely you will suffer a break or fracture if you do fall.\nExercising helps improve your balance, your coordination, and can improve your flexibility if you include stretching., You don\u2019t have to do high-intensity exercises like running to see improvement in your bones and muscles or your balance and coordination. Many exercises to help strengthen your body can be done in your living room and don't require you to be super fit. Ease into exercise and only do what you're comfortable with or feel safe doing.\n\n\nYou can do many of these exercises even if you have a cane, a walker, or a disability.\n\n, When deciding to use exercise to help with fall prevention, you should come up with a well-rounded workout regimen. This means not just doing cardio or balance exercises. You should do multiple kinds of exercise to give your body an overall workout.\n\n\nTry including strength training and flexibility exercises once or twice a week. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of walking gait training, which is usually done with the guidance of a physical therapist.Studies have shown a well-rounded plan helps with reaction time, walking gait, muscle strength, coordination, cognitive functions, and physical ability. Strengthening all these areas helps prevent falls.\nA sample program might look something like:\n\nMonday \u2014 Tai Chi class 45 minutes\nTuesday \u2014 20 minutes walking with range of motion warm up, plus stretches after\nWednesday \u2014 Balance exercises 10 minutes, alternating upper and lower body work, alternating large muscle and small muscle groups\nThursday \u2014 Stationary bike, followed by stretching\nFriday \u2014 Balance exercises 10 minutes, walking 15 minutes, stretching five to 10 minutes\nSaturday \u2014 Pool exercises, stretching in the hot tub, upper and lower body (especially hip flexors, chest, anterior delts, hamstrings, calves)\nSunday \u2014 Rest\n\n\n\n, For these exercises to build your strength, balance, and coordination, you should do the exercises two or more days a week. Talk to your doctor and decide how many days you should start off exercising.Most physicians suggest getting 30 minutes of cardio exercise at least four or five times a week, though you can work out every day. You may need to start with only two days of exercise a week and gradually work up to more. Discuss the frequency and length of your exercises with your physician.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118988}

Push yourself up on your toes (soles of your shoes rather than laces) and hands. You should be in \"push-up position;\" arms should be shoulder-width apart and feet can be anywhere from shoulder-width apart to almost together (whatever works best for you). Your back should be flat, making a fairly even platform (or plank) from your shoulders to your heels; in other words, you back should not be arched or slumped towards the ground. This will help to keep your abs and back muscles engaged. A modification to this is, rather than staying up on your hands, drop down onto your elbows. Hold this position for 30-60 seconds.\n\n, Lay on your back with your arms relaxed at your side, knees bent and feet on the ground, about hip-width apart, heels directly beneath your knees. Focusing on using your lower back, bring your hips up until they create an even platform from your shoulders to your knees. This should be a slow controlled movement. Resist the urge to push with your legs and focus on pulling with your back and glutes. Hold at this spot for a few seconds before slowly lowering back down.\n\n\nDo three sets of eight to ten reps.\n\n, Lie down across the stability ball facing the floor, with your hips placed over the ball and legs extended.

Then slowly lower yourself back down to the ground and repeat.\n\n\nRepeat the motion for eight to ten repetitions.\n\n, The classic pull-up is one of the best back exercises you can do. Use the wide grip (palms facing away from you, hands wider than shoulder width) to focus more on your back muscles and less on your chest and biceps. While difficult, there are few better exercises to do for you back. Do as many as possible, starting with one to three reps per set, and work your way up to three sets of ten reps., Tie the resistance band onto a sturdy object that is about the height of your elbows. You can sit in a chair or on the floor, but your legs must be fully extended in front of you and your spine straight.

Wash the area around your nose stud, whether you have a stud in or not. Also wash the nose stud itself.\n\n\nIt is really important to clean the piece of metal that you are sticking into your body. Germs on the stud could transfer straight to your nose, so make sure the stud is clean.\nIt's a good idea to use a saline solution or a mild antiseptic solution to make sure the area is really clean but you can use hydrogen peroxide or plain soap too. Either way, make sure that the cleaner is washed off and the stud is dry before inserting it.;\n, An L-shaped stud is a simple piece of metal with a decorative end and a 90 degree angle at the other end. To insert it you will first need to find the hole in your nose. Push the end of the stud, the opposite end of the decorative end, in the hole making sure to be gentle and that the stud is going straight through to the other side of the hole. When you're sure that the end of the stud is through to the other side (you can feel the inside of your nose to make sure that it is) gently push the rest of the stud in, angling the stud to get the bent part of the stud through the hole.\n\n\nFeel free to do this slowly, pushing only a little bit at a time.\nThe L-shaped nose stud is fully in when the decorative end of the stud is up against the outside of your nose.\n\n, To make sure that you've put in your nose stud correctly, lift up your nostril a bit and look in the mirror. You should be able to see the end of the L-shaped stud inside your nose. The end that is inside your nose should be pointing straight up or down, depending on your preference, and you shouldn't be able to feel it. If you can feel it or its just uncomfortable, readjust it's position.\n\n\nL-shaped nose studs are easy to insert but that also means that they can come out of your nose pretty easily. Be aware of this and take care that it doesn't fall out or your piercing might close up. , Taking out your L-shaped nose stud is simple if you remember that inside your nose the stud is bent at a 90 degree angle. This means that as you pull it out of your nose, while holding onto the decorative end, you will need to angle it down to get the bent portion through your piercing hole. Once the bent portion is through, you can just remove your nose stud.\n\n\nRemember to take your time, as a nose piercing can be sensitive to pressure and force.\nOnce again, make sure your hands and the area around the piercing are clean before handling your nose stud!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":118990}
{"text":" Decide which material you want your tape to be made out of and choose which color you\u2019d like your tape to be. Consider tapes that have the ability to absorb moisture, as this will prevent your hands from slipping when you use the bat. There are many kinds of tapes, including electrical tape, grip tape, bat tape, and tennis tape.Avoid using plastic tapes because they do not absorb moisture.\nAvoid using shiny electrical tape because it is illegal for most league play.;\n, There\u2019s no point in going to the store to buy new materials for taping your bat if you or your family already has them. Save yourself some money and take a look around your house to determine if you already have the following materials:\n\n\na utility knife or scissors\nfine-grit sandpaper or residue remover\nelectrical tape, bat tape or tennis tape\na magic marker\nlatex gloves (optional), You\u2019ll have to purchase or borrow the materials if you didn\u2019t find them around your house. Take a look at your budget to determine how to best acquire what you need.\n\n\nGo to your local hardware store or sporting goods store to purchase any materials that you don\u2019t already have.Ask a team member or coach if they have extra supplies you can borrow if you\u2019re short on money.\nChoose less expensive materials if you cannot afford them or improvise based on what materials you have on hand.\n\n, Peel off any old tape that\u2019s on your bat. Make sure you take all the tape off.It\u2019s important to start with fresh tape, especially for the lower layers. You want the tape to adhere to your bat as much as possible.\n\n, Use a piece of fine-grit sandpaper to get rid of any remaining tape residue if you are using a wooden bat. Try to remove as little wood as possible and make sure your sandpapering is even.Use a specialized residue remover like Goo Gone or CleanUp Batter if you are using an aluminum bat. Both solvents can be used by pouring a small amount onto a rag and rubbing the area of your bat where you want to remove residue. You can wear latex gloves for this step if you like.\n\n, Check the rules of your league to confirm how high you\u2019re allowed to tape your bat. Some leagues are very specific and you could be disqualified if you don\u2019t adhere to league rules. Use the magic marker to make a small mark on your bat where you would like your tape to end. Some players prefer 8 inches while others prefer 12 inches. Hold the bat in playing position and decide what feels most comfortable for you.\n\n, Make sure the bat is in a secure position where it can\u2019t move. You can place the bat between your legs or have a friend hold the bat for you.Make sure you don\u2019t tighten things too much if you secure your bat using a clamp.\n\n, Angle the tape about 45 degrees to your bat, press the tape to the bottom of your bat and begin taping upwards. You can choose to wrap the tape at a different degree, but many players prefer a 45 degree angle because it helps them grip the bat better. Leave space in between the tape as you wrap that is roughly equal to the size of the tape. Wrap your bat for about 8 to 12 inches, depending on your preference. Cut the end of the tape at an angle and secure it to the bat., Angle a second piece of tape about 45 degrees to your bat, press the tape to the bottom of your bat and begin taping upwards, though in the opposite circular direction as your first piece. This second piece of tape should fill in the spaces that you left in the first piece. Cut the end of the tape at an angle and secure it to the bat. This will leave some gaps where the bat shows through, but many players prefer this because it helps them grip the bat better., You\u2019ll want to test the tape on your bat by holding the bat as if you were in the batter\u2019s box and ready to hit. It\u2019s important to learn how to appropriately hold your bat.\n\n\nPlace the bat handle across the lower base of your fingers and close your hands around it. Your left hand should be below your right hand if you\u2019re a right-handed hitter. Your right hand should be below your left hand if you\u2019re a left-handed hitter.\nRotate your hands so that your knuckles align.\nStay loose and do not over-grip the bat., Step outside and find some space to swing your bat. Go to your local ballpark or use a makeshift home plate if you can\u2019t get there. Get into proper batting stance:\n\n\nStand with your body perpendicular to the plate.\nPlace the bat over your shoulder, keeping it pointed up.\nMake sure your feet remain shoulder width apart.\nKeep your hips, knees and shoulders square to the plate.\nSlightly bend your knees., Put your bat into action and swing it as if you were hitting a ball.

{"text":" Before you make any throw, your entire body should be shifted into the \u201cready position\u201d for throwing. Your feet should be shoulder width apart with knees slightly bent, your body should be relaxed, and your hips and shoulders should be lined up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with the ball held in your glove near your chest. This places it in a good location for you to make a quick throw.\nMake sure your feet aren\u2019t staggered. You will start your throw with your feet at a level distance, and then take a step away as you throw. You should not take this step before beginning to throw though.\nWhen you throw the ball, you will keep your feet and shoulders in line similar to in the ready position.\nStay alert and focused whenever you are preparing to throw. Even if you are waiting around before practice, avoid dawdling while you stand and practice your throwing stance.;\n, Once you\u2019ve gotten into position, the next step is to hold the ball. Although simply holding the ball may seem easy, it is necessary to use the proper grip. Place your index and middle finger across one of the rows of seems, with your thumb forming a third gripping-point directly underneath. Your ring and pinky fingers should curl slightly behind the ball and aid in supporting it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding the ball along the seams correctly positively influences the speed and direction of the throw. When held this way, your throw is more likely to be straight rather than a curved lob.\nKeep the ball out on your fingertips and not in the palm of your hand. Palming the ball will cause a slower release time, which worsens your accuracy and speed.\nIdeally, your grip should allow you to contact all four seams at once. This is difficult at first, but practicing holding the ball in this fashion from the get-go will give you improved throwing over time.\nAt first you may have to look at the ball to line up the seams with your correct fingers, but as you practice you should be able to feel the correct finger placement without looking, using only touch.\n\n, One of the most important parts of making a good throw is moving your joints in the correct manner. This includes your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. In good throwing, all three of these should be moved together. If any of these joints is stiff and doesn\u2019t move when you throw, practice actively moving each during every wind-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you wind-up for your throw, your arm should swing loose in your shoulder socket. To practice your ability to move your shoulder freely, do windmill arm exercises. Rotate your arms in wide forward-facing circles around your shoulder.\nMake sure you keep a bent elbow during each throw. Although you use a windmill-like motion to bring the ball back and around your body, your elbow should bend in the process. A stiff elbow will limit the distance of your throw.\nThink of your wind-up as a cross between making a windmill circle and pulling a bow and arrow. Your elbow should be bent, but will wind-up behind your torso in a circular rotation.\nYour wrist should be incredibly flexible and used heavily in each throw. As the saying goes, \u201cit\u2019s all in the wrist.\u201d Just prior to releasing the ball, your wrist should be bent back so that your palm is facing forward. As you throw the ball, you will flick your wrist downwards in a strong motion.

By looking closely at the fabric of your suit, you\u2019ll also notice that it\u2019s made up of a few colors rather than just one. For example, a gray suit could actually have gray, brown and pink in the tread of the fabric. Identify those colors of your suit and showcase them in your tie selections.\n\n,, This is a little difficult since these shoes don\u2019t come in many colors, but if you rotate between 3 or even 2 pairs (e.g., black, brown and camel), you\u2019ll keep the outfit fresh. You can also have 2 or 3 pairs of the same color shoes (e.g., brown) but they come in different finishes (Patten leather, alligator and suede). The different finishes will all cater to a slightly different look that could further improve the versatility of your suit.\nWomen could consider rotating colors as well, but also rotating the style.

{"text":" While Vaseline is not a moisturizer, it can be used to soften skin and lock in moisture on dry skin. You can use Vaseline as a spot-treatment for dry skin, especially during winter, helping to protect skin exposed to adverse weather conditions.\n\n\nApply Vaseline to your elbows or knees to help moisturize the skin and rid the areas of any ashy texture or appearance.\nIf you have callouses or rough spots on your feet, apply a thin coat of Vaseline at night then slip on some clean socks. Your feet should feel a bit softer the next morning.\nApply a small amount on dry spots on your body before fake tanning lotions are applied. This will help to prevent uneven tanning.Use petroleum jelly after shaving. It can be used to smooth and soothe clean, freshly shaven skin.;\n, Used alone or in tandem with makeup, Vaseline is a commonly-used and cheap product to highlight the natural beauty of your eyes. As long as you\u2019re very careful to avoid getting petroleum jelly into your eyes, Vaseline is perfectly safe.\n\n\nUse a touch of Vaseline mixed with powder eyeshadow pigment to make new colors. Or, use it for a more solid eyeshadow that won\u2019t get all over your face when you put it on. Some people like to apply Vaseline under eye shadow to create a shiny effect.\nVaseline can be used to tame unruly eyebrows, by brushing a small amount across them. Similarly, you can use Vaseline to define your lashes and leave them with a glossy and waterproof look.Apply a thin coat to your eyelashes before you go to bed. While unproven, many people think that Vaseline may help your eyelashes grow longer and thicker over time.\n\n, Rub Vaseline onto your cuticles several times a day for softer, better-looking cuticles. Vaseline is often used as part of a manicure, to help make the cuticles pliable for tending back. It's an excellent way of caring for your fingertips.\n\n\nMake your week-old nail polish look new again by rubbing a small dab over the polish, helping to restore the glisten and shine.\n\n, In cold or dry weather, a very small layer of Vaseline applied to chapped lips can help retain moisture and keep your lips from drying out. Some people like to apply Vaseline before scrubbing lips with a toothbrush to exfoliate and leave them feeling smooth.\n\n, While it may seem odd, applying Vaseline to the teeth is an old stage-hand trick, used to get dancers and other performers more enthusiastic about grinning. Vaseline prevents your lips from sticking to your teeth, and is a common preventative measure taken when applying lipstick. Done correctly, Vaseline can help avoid getting lipstick on the teeth.\n\n\nUse caution and only apply a very small amount of Vaseline to your teeth. Nobody wants a mouthful of petroleum jelly.\n\n, Small amounts of Vaseline can be effective at managing hair, locking in moisture, and treating dry scalp issues that you might be having. You want to use Vaseline sparingly, since it's very difficult to wash out, but it can be an effective treatment in some cases.\n\n\nUse Vaseline to reduce scaling and itching associated with dandruff. Condition the scalp with Vaseline pre-shampooing, massaging it gently into your scalp before a shower.\nUse Vaseline as a mask around the hairline when dyeing hair. It can protect against harmful hair dyeing, perming and straightening chemicals.\nIn a pinch, a very small dab of Vaseline can be used in place of mousse or styling gel. Smear a tiny bit on your hands and scrunch through your hair for a choppy look.\n\n, One of the most common and effective uses of Vaseline is in helping to prevent chaffing-related rashes or irritation caused by clothes. Runners and cyclists will often apply a small amount of Vaseline to the insides of the thighs to avoid chaffing during a long race. Some people struggle with nipple chaffing caused by certain articles of clothing or varieties of fabric. If you have a problem with chaffing, apply a preventative coat of Vaseline to the area to keep yourself moving.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119001}
{"text":" The most common part of the body to exfoliate with a pumice stone is the feet. Heels tend to develop a layer of hard, calloused skin that can become cracked or scaled. Your elbows are another area that may benefit from exfoliation. Soak the calloused body part in warm water for about five minutes to soften the skin.If you're working on your feet, you may want to fill a bowl with warm water and soak your feet in the bowl.\nFor other parts of the body, pumicing as part of your shower may be easiest.;\n, The skin will be easier to remove if it's soft and supple. Feel your skin after several minutes of soaking. If it still feels tough, wait a few more minutes (giving the water a warm-up if necessary). If it's soft, your skin is ready for the pumice stone.\n\n, Wetting the stone will help it slide more easily across your skin, rather than catching on it. Run the stone under warm water, or dip it in the water where you're soaking your skin, in order to thoroughly wet it.\n\n, Use a circular motion to start sloughing away the dead skin with the pumice stone. If the skin is nice and soft, it should start coming right off. Keep going until you remove the dead skin and get to the fresh, supple skin underneath.\n\n\nDon't press too hard. Light pressure is all that is needed; let the surface of the stone do the work.\nIf you're working on your feet, focus on the heels, the sides of your toes, and other areas where dry skin tends to build up.\n\n, Rinse off the dead skin and take a look to see if you need to keep going. If you still see bits of dead skin, go over the area again with the pumice stone. Continue using the stone on the area until you're satisfied with the results.\n\n\nSince the pumice stone will wear down slightly while you use it, you may need to turn it over to get a fresh surface you can use to exfoliate your skin.\nRinse the pumice stone often to keep its surface clean and effective.\n\n, When you're finished, use a towel to pat your skin dry. Coat the area with an oil or cream to prevent it from drying out too quickly. Your formerly calloused skin should now be soft, supple and gleaming.\n\n\nCoconut oil, almond oil, or body lotion are all fine to use to condition your skin after pumicing.\nRepeat as often as needed to keep your skin in good shape.\n\n, Dead skin will build up in the pores of the stone as you use it, so you'll want to clean the stone after use. Use a scrub brush to scrub the stone while holding it under running water. Add a bit of soap to help clean the stone completely. This way your stone will be clean and ready to use next time you need it.\n\n, Set the pumice stone in a dry place so that it doesn't stay damp in between uses. Some pumice stones come with a string attached that allows you to hang the stone to dry. If you let the stone stay wet, bacteria could grow in the pores, making it unsafe to use.\n\n, Every once in a while, you'll want to give the stone a deep cleaning to make sure it isn't harboring bacteria. Bring a small pot of water to a full boil, drop in the stone, and boil it for five minutes. Use tongs to remove the stone from the water and allow it to dry completely before storing.\n\n\nIf you use the stone frequently, boil it every two weeks to ensure it stays clean.\nIf you've used the stone on a dirty surface, you can add a capful of bleach to the water to be certain all bacteria get killed.\n\n, Pumice is a soft stone that will eventually wear away after you've used it for awhile. When it gets too small to handle easily, or the surface becomes too smooth to be effective, go ahead and spring for a new one. Pumice stones are inexpensive and can be found at any store that sells beauty supplies.\n\n, The ancient Greeks used pumice to remove body hair, and some still use it for this purpose. Pumice makes a gentle natural hair remover. Soak your skin in the bath or in a shower until it's warm and soft. Wet the pumice stone, then rub your skin using a gentle circular motion. Within about 30 seconds, the area you're rubbing will be free of hair.\n\n\nThe effects of pumicing are similar to the effects of shaving. The hair is removed close to the skin, rather than being pulled out.Pumicing should not be painful. If you feel pain, make sure you aren't pressing too hard.\n\n, The soft, porous surface of pumice is perfect for taking pills and lint off of clothing. If you have a sweater you've been wanting to clean up, lay it on a flat surface. Rub a dry pumice stone over the pills in a circular motion. Don't press too hard, since you don't want to damage the fibers of the garment; a gentle pressure is all that's needed to take the pills right off.\n\n, Pumice can be used to remove copper rings from the inside of a toilet. Put on a pair of nonporous cleaning gloves to start. Then simply rub the pumice stone over the ring using a scrubbing motion. Repeat until the ring is gone.You can use the stone in combination with toilet cleaner for more stubborn stains.\nBe sure to use separate stones for toilet cleaning and body use. Do not use the same stone for both purposes.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119002}
{"text":" If you\u2019ve had your mascara for more than 3 months or if you are truly scraping the bottom of the barrel, you may want to spring for a new bottle.\n\n\nCheck the wand for damage. A damaged mascara wand can cause issues regardless of whether you bring it back to life or not. Make sure the wand is still in good shape and\/or has not been used by anyone other than you--sharing mascara will afford you a quick trip to the eye doctor (infection)!;\n, You may be tempted to use a pre-opened bottle, however a previously used bottle may still harbor germs from an eye infection or may have gathered bacteria since its last use (you don\u2019t want to use any bottle of eye drops older than a year).\n\n, Clumping and old makeup typically bottles up around the top, which can cause further issues. Use a tissue and a little petroleum jelly to remove any residue.\n\n, The number of drops will depend on how dried out the makeup has become. The best approach is to add 2 or 3 drops, shake the bottle (after replacing wand\/lid) and then taking the mascara for a test drive. If you like the consistency, stop there. Otherwise add 1 or 2 more drops, shake and repeat until mascara is ready.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119003}
{"text":" At the end of the day, your face has been through a lot. Rounds of makeup, sunlight, exposure to dust and dirt -- to make sure all those things to wreak havoc overnight (resulting in breakouts), cleanse your face before bed. Choose one that moisturizes and has a calming scent. It should be gentle and leave your face feeling smooth and clean.\n\n\nIf you're leaving make-up stains (eye or otherwise) on your pillows, use a soft makeup remover, too. It's possible that your cleanser isn't strong enough.\nSome women like to cleanse in the morning, too. If you're face is a little on the oily side, this is a good idea. But this cleanse should have a citrusy scent; lemon, orange, mango, or pomegranate-scented cleaners can make you feel more energized.;\n, Your skin, especially your face, is very important. After you wash your face, apply a moisturizer to prevent your skin from drying out. An unscented lotion is fine, but a cream designed just for your face is better. And if you're nearing that age where wrinkles are on the horizon, invest in a good night cream. Better to start too early!\n\n\nReally you should be moisturizing everywhere. Take a day every week to slather your hands and feet in lotion or body butter and sleep with socks and mittens on. The 8-hour deep moisturizing session will leave your hands and feet soft as a baby's bottom.\n\n, Your teeth are what everyone sees when you smile, so make the best of them! Always brush your teeth in the morning and night, so as to avoid bad breath and have good oral hygiene. Use a good toothpaste, and change your toothbrush every 3 months, to ensure what you're putting in your mouth is clean.\n\n\nIf yellow teeth are a concern of yours, a quick and easy (and cheap!) option is to dab a bit of baking soda on your toothbrush after you brush your teeth each night and give your pearly whites a quick extra scrub down. Baking soda is a natural bleaching agent and just a bit is enough to wear down those pesky yellow stains.\n\n, 8 hours of tossing and turning on that pillow can quite literally do damage to your tresses. Since you probably can't avoid the unconsciously switching positions part, put your hair up in a high bun or in a loose braid before bed. And you'll wake up with volume and waves naturally!\n\n\nAnd when it comes to hair products, splurge for that occasional leave-in treatment. Twice a month or so, deep condition your hair, leaving it overnight. The extra nutrients will be soaked up by your strands, leaving them glossy and beautiful.\n\n, If you sweat a lot or sometimes forget to put deodorant in the morning, use clinical strength deodorant before going to bed. If you forget to add again in the morning it still works throughout the day. That means no deodorant stains on your black shirt in the morning!\n\n\nIn case it needs to be said, make sure to shower on the regular. If you're exercising routinely, that goes double. Use a good body wash and loofah it up!\n\n, By now you've probably heard about the wonder that is water -- it's great for your hair, your nails, and your skin. It can prevent breakouts and give you that natural glow you've been looking for. Oh, and it's great for your organs, too!\n\n\n8 glasses of water a day is good, but try to do even more. It can even help you lose weight! Up your intake by a liter and you could drop 5 pounds without really even noticing. Cold water can up your metabolism and crush your appetite, too!, If you've ever had a late night that involved nachos, candy bars, and beer, you know exactly where this is going. Oily, fatty, and sugary foods can lead to breakouts. Salty foods and alcohol can lead to bloating and your face being puffy in the morning. These foods are not only bad for you on the outside, but they're bad for you on the inside, too! All the more reason to eat healthily.\n\n\nYou'll be doing your body the most favors if you drink lots of water and don't eat a heavy meal before bed. Keep dinner light and avoid having more than one alcoholic drink and piling on the sugar and salt.\n\n, Simply taking 10 minutes in the morning to do some yoga stretches can get your blood flowing (giving your face a more natural color) and work your synovial fluid (the fluid that lubricates your joints). And it'll wake you up! Nothing like a good, natural wake up call to get that endorphin rush for the rest of the day.\n\n, After saluting the sun, take another 10 minutes to do some meditation, clearing your mind and upping your positive energy. Smiling can make us more beautiful, so set your mind on a positive track to put that pep in your step. Just a few minutes of me time spent with a clear head can make the rest of the day so much easier to tackle.\n\n, 8 hours of supporting your head's weight (up to 10 pounds!) can wreak some serious terror on your face. Because of this, try to condition yourself to sleep on your back. Sleeping on your stomach or your side puts weight on your face, ultimately resulting in lines and puffiness.\n\n\nSatin or silk pillows will be a great investment, too, and the more the merrier. Softer pillows prevent your hair from breaking and sleeping at a slight incline (propped up, that is) keeps your face from being puffy all over. Gravity helps lymph and blood flow so fluid won't accumulate.\n\n, Try to sleep for at least 8 hours every night. On two pillows! When we don't get enough, even our skin gets tired -- it sags, you get bags, and it loses its glow. Your blood vessels dilate (not a good thing) and you're extra stressed throughout the day, leading to even more problems.So don't risk it! Pile on the beauty sleep -- it's free and it feels darn good.\n\n\nYour body is actually going into repair mode while you sleep, from your brain to your muscles to your skin. New cells are actually being regenerated. However, too much sleep isn't great, either. Keep it somewhere between 7 and 9.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119004}

Maintain eye contact as you deliberately undo the buttons.\n\n, Don't be in a rush to get naked; the \"tease\" part of a striptease will get your partner excited. Tell your partner to stay seated on a chair, and walk around the chair showing off your body from the front, back, and sides. Tug at the straps on your dress or bra, or the buttons on your shirt, as though you are about to take them off any second.Get creative with your own sexy poses, or include these:\n\n\nIf you're wearing a low-cut shirt, bend forward over your partner briefly.\nFace away from your partner and bend forward over a chair or bed.\nTouch your partner's crotch briefly, then pull away.\nSit on a chair and slowly part your legs while giving your partner a sexy smile.\nGrab and stroke yourself around your breasts, crotch, or any body part your partner finds sexy.\n\n, Either stand with your legs together in a feminine stance with one ball on the foot knee pointing in, or go for a stronger stance with your legs sexily spread apart with your weight slightly to one side. Cross your arms across your chest and suck your stomach in as you lift your hands up over your head.\n\n\nIf you have long hair, shake your head and let your hair flow out as you do this.\n\n, Button-up shirts are perfect for stripping, since you can turn each button into its own mini-performance. Try leaving a couple buttons at the top and bottom undone in advance to make the outfit sexier. Remove the buttons slowly, one by one, as you continue to move around and pose. Once all the buttons are undone, slip the shirt down low over your shoulders, turn your back to your partner, and let the shirt fall to the floor.Unbutton the cuffs first, or undo them in advance before you enter the room.\nYou can sex this up a bit by only using one hand while having the other on your hip. Practice this in advance if you're going to try it.\n\n, Keep teasing your partner between items of clothing, or ask \"are you ready for more?\" a few times before giving in. Lower the straps of your negligee or similar loose item of clothing over your shoulders and let it fall, or shimmy it down to the floor.\n\n, A zippered skirt is great for beginners, since you can remove it easily and unexpectedly while striking almost any pose. A short, clingy skirt is another good option, and can be pulled up to reveal your butt before shimmying it off., You might want to practice this one in advance, since tight jeans tend to be less sexy when you're falling over with your legs trapped. Try kneeling, then pushing your jeans down to your knees while you stick your butt out at your partner. Sit back on your butt to pull the jeans off the rest of the way., You might want to leave your stockings on, especially with a sexy garter belt. On the other hand, a simple pair of nylon stockings can be a great prop. Put your leg up on a chair and roll them off slowly, then snapping it away slingshot style, or pretend to tie your wrists together. These are great visuals and good methods for adding a bit of cheeky humour to the mood.If you can walk around and pose gracefully with heels, you could leave them on as well as the stockings.\nTry wearing a pair of stockings one size too large, with a garter belt to keep them on. This gives you more freedom of movement during your striptease., Tug at the straps of your bra throughout the striptease, to get your partner excited. When you're finally ready to remove it, turn your back to your partner, and unhook the bra. Let it drop to your floor, then turn around to reveal your breasts., If you have an opportunity to prepare in advance, pick a sexy pair or lacy panties or a thong, but don't pick something so tight that it leaves marks.Try slipping them off while standing with your legs straight, or lay on your back and pull them up to your feet, where you can flick them off.\n\n\nIf you're wearing a sexy garter belt, wear your panties over it, so you can keep your garter belt on.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119005}
{"text":" Consider cutting your hair, getting some side swept bangs, or fringing it; this change can get you out of that style slump and change your look. Or, change your hair color.

You may be surprised to discover that colored eyeliner can look good on you, depending on your eye color. Purple has been shown to look good with brown eyes, gold with green or hazel eyes, and orange with blue. However, this style may not be for everyone.\n\n, Get inspired by current or different outfits, hairstyles, or makeup trends. Circle what you could envision yourself wearing, or anything that appeals to you even if you can't imagine yourself wearing it.\n\n, Look at individual items, thinking about whether or not you like them, and why. Think about what would make you confident, what gives out the message you want to send. Don't aim to replace your entire wardrobe, but put aside clothes that you've worn too often, and get something different.\n\n\nDetermine the colors that you like, that you look good in, and that make you feel confident in yourself.\n\n, Scout out a creative bag, or use a bag that you haven't used in a while.

{"text":" If you\u2019re a fan of leggings, you\u2019re aware that they come in every color under the sun. While a pastel pink or a cool patterned pair are great for a workout class, don\u2019t try to dress those up for work. If you want to pull off leggings at work, they need to be black. Black leggings look much more sleek and professional than any other color, and you\u2019re less likely to call attention to the fact that they are, in fact, leisure clothes.;\n, You wouldn\u2019t wear a ratty old T-shirt to work, so don\u2019t try to pull off your ratty old leggings. Lower quality leggings often fade and start pilling after a wash or two. If your leggings are covered in loose strings and fuzz, you won\u2019t be able to wear them in a professional environment. Invest in a pair of leggings that hold up in the washing machine, and wash them carefully to ensure they stay in tiptop condition.\n\n\nTurn your leggings inside out and use a bio detergent when you wash them. This will help to prevent pilling, which makes your leggings look worn out., Thin leggings may look great in the dim lighting of your bedroom as you get ready for work, but be careful. In the bright, unforgiving lights of your office, those same leggings may be completely see-through. Make sure you examine your leggings thoroughly in bright and natural lighting before heading to the office.Use your hands to pull the fabric taut. If you can see skin through the stretched fabric, save those leggings for the comfort of your own home.\n\n, Leggings can certainly cling to your curves, and that\u2019s not exactly the look you should be going for in the workplace. To ensure your outfit is conservative enough, avoid pairing your tight leggings with a tight top. Instead, pair them with a flowing blouse, a longer tunic, or an oversized sweater.Choose tops that hit mid-thigh and cover your rear. Showing too much of the top of your leggings looks less professional and modest.\n\n, Nothing says professional quite like a tailored blazer. By wearing layers on your top half, you\u2019ll attract the eye that way. A crisp blazer will steal the show, allowing you to be happily comfortable on the bottom half. If you wear a blazer or another dressy layer on your top, you don\u2019t have to worry about being underdressed on the bottom.Layer your blazers over a long shirt or dress. Your rear should still be fully covered.\nCrisp button-downs, dressy cardigans, and structured, high-quality tops can all be worn to dress up your top half.\n\n, If you have a mini dress that you absolutely adore, try wearing it with opaque leggings. Unlike see-through tights, dark leggings will make the outfit look much more conservative. Think of leggings as thick stockings that can make even the shortest dresses suitable for the office.Keep in mind that this only works if all other elements of the dress are more conservative. For example, adding leggings to a dress with a plunging neckline and skinny spaghetti straps won't automatically make the dress work-appropriate!\n\n, If you\u2019re afraid that your outfit isn\u2019t dressy enough for the office, try throwing on a beautiful piece of jewelry to take it up a notch. For example, leggings paired with an oversized sweater may look too casual alone. Throw on a chunky statement necklace, and you\u2019ve taken it from relaxed to trendy.\n\n\nWhen looking for work-appropriate jewelry, consider things like statement necklaces and chunky bracelets. Avoid things like noisy bangles that might be distracting, as well as overly large earrings that may be a bit too flashy for the workplace.\nBangles, watches, flashy earrings, and layered necklaces are all great options to dress up a legging outfit.\n\n, Your leggings should just be part of your outfit, and certainly not the focus point. Accessorizing can add some sophistication and style to an outfit that may be a bit plain on its own. Try adding a fun belt over a dress or oversized cardigan. In the colder months, pop a chic scarf around your neck.When you're selecting accessories for this look, think dressy. For example, choose a silk scarf over a chunky knit scarf. Casual accessories will make your entire outfit look casual, while dressier accessories will elevate your look, and hide the fact that you're wearing leggings!\n\n, Your favorite black leggings will look much different paired with patent leather heels than they do with your running shoes. Knee-high boots and ballet flats can also transform your look, making your leggings look polished and professional.By pairing the typically sporty leggings with fancier, more feminine footwear, you can easily take your leggings from the gym to the office.\n\n\nConsider grounding your leggings with some tall boots for a preppy and professional look.\n\n, It's not always possible to do a gorgeous full face of makeup with perfectly-styled hair every single day, but it's important that you put a bit more effort into your hair and makeup when you wear leggings to work. Remember, it's all about balance. By taking a bit of time to enhance your features with makeup and make your hair look tidy, you'll look more more formal and work-appropriate.\n\n\nThrowing your hair up in a messy bun and skipping the makeup is probably fine some days, but if you do this while also wearing leggings, you'll look ready to nap rather than work.\nCheck these articles for tips on doing your makeup and hair for work.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119007}
{"text":" A shortstop also has to have a strong arm to get the ball across the diamond to the first baseman. To do this, play \"long toss\" (throwing over 100-150 feet) for at least five minutes each time you warm up. Start slow and don't hurt your arm by trying to throw that far on a line. A nice arch is fine until you build strength.\n\n, This is where good footwork is a must.\n\n, If a ball is hit to left field the shortstop has to be the cut-off man on the play.\n\n, There is no point in having a fast throw if you cannot release the ball in time.\n\n, Before the pitcher pitches, take a look and remember where the base runners and fielders are positioned. This is so that you know where to throw to when you get the ball, which is extremely important since the ball will go to you most of the time.\n\n, After the catcher, the shortstop directs the infield. Decide who's going to back up the throw back to the pitcher, who will be taking the throw on a pickoff and whether your infield is positioned correctly are some of the shortstops responsibilities.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119008}
{"text":" Tagging up (or \"tagging\") in baseball is a good way to manufacture runs. If you're on a base with less than two outs, you can tag up and advance to the next base (including home plate) as soon as an outfielder has caught a fly ball.\n, If you're at third base with less than two outs, once you recognize that a fly ball is likely to be caught, you should return to the base, tag up, and run to home plate to score a run. First, however, you must decide (with the help of your third-base coach) whether the ball has been hit deeply enough into the outfield to allow you to advance to home plate before the outfielder can throw the ball there. If you think you can do it, touch the bag with either foot and wait., Lean toward home plate while you wait for the outfielder to catch the fly ball. As soon as the ball contacts the fielder's glove (or anything else, for that matter), push off the bag with your foot., Sprint as fast as you can toward home. Don't look back at the ball, because that will slow you down. Let your teammates tell you whether you need to slide or not. Concentrate on touching home plate before the catcher can tag you with the ball.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119009}
{"text":" A left fielder will need an outfielder's glove. The typical outfielder's glove is long with deep pockets. This helps with reaching fly balls on the run. Most are labeled appropriately and are available in a variety of styles and in a wide range of prices.;\n, Take some time throwing pop flies with a friend or coach. Playing long toss can also help you get comfortable with catching the ball at long distances and warming up your arm. The left fielder, like center fielders and right fielders, will need to make very deep throws from time to time.\n\n, A left fielder is not just an outfielder. Like the other two positions, there are specific jobs that a left fielder is responsible for.\n\n\nBacking up third. On throws to third base by the catcher, the left fielder is always responsible for backing up the play and being prepared in case the throw is off target.\nCovering for other positions. On plays to center field, be nearby in case the center fielder is unable to make the play. One such example is a fly ball to left-center that the CF unsuccessfully dives for. Since the CF will be unable to recover quickly, it becomes the responsibility of the LF to handle the play and respond accordingly.\nKnow where to throw. Always focus on the game. It can be challenging since more often than not the LF is far away from the action. However, when the ball does come your way it is very important to know where to go with it. If the play is deep, throw to your cutoff man (almost always the SS). If players are on base, it is required for the LF to know where to throw to hold the runners. Never attempt a throw from LF to first base, for example. Also if there are runners on base, be aware that the throw to home should be avoided if there are other runners on besides the one going home. Hitting the cutoff man as an alternative can help keep runners in their places.\n\n, The left fielder often has the weakest arm of the three outfielders because they need to throw shorter distances to hold runners. This is not an excuse to have a weak throwing arm, however. A left fielder who can make bullet throws is always a plus. Build up arm strength by playing long toss and catch often, and exercising the muscles in your arm. On sacrifice flies to left, a strong arm is needed to throw out a runner. If the play is to home, it can also be quite a far throw.\n\n, Being an outfield position, speed is key to being successful. The left fielder will need to be able to react quickly and make long runs to reach deep hits. The area covered by the left fielder is smaller than the center fielder, but still a vast territory. Do sprints and take runs to help with speed and endurance. Challenging teammates to races can also be a fun way to motivate yourself to get faster, but be sure you are warmed up and avoid injury.\n\n, In addition to a decent arm and speed, a good left fielder also needs to be able to handle the ball. Errors in left field are rare in Major League baseball, and constantly dropping and muffing routine catches is not a good way to impress your coach. Practice fielding pop flies from and actual hitter to get a feel for what playing the outfield is like. Make sure you also get a chance to try to catch some pop flies on the run. Also, diving plays may look fancy, but be sure you know when to attempt a dive and when it's best to let a tough catch land in front of you. Do not attempt dives with runners on base, because if you miss they will likely advance. Learn to take good routes to the ball both for hits in the air and on the ground. Doing so can help you ready yourself for throws, help you run down flies, and make a base runner think twice before taking off.\n\n, The corner outfield positions (left and right field) are often occupied by normal or powerful hitters. Since it is less of a finesse and speed position than center, a left fielder is expected to produce at the plate and hit for at least satisfactory power and average. It is possible to be a left fielder without possessing a good bat, but it is fairly rare in competitive and professional baseball.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119010}
{"text":" Outfielders usually have gloves a little on the longer side, as the extra extension helps with the tough catches.;\n, So they will usually hit it into left to center field.\n\n,, Know where to throw the ball in every situation, if you don't, ask a teammate or coach. This will help you execute more smoothly. (If the first baseman wants to cutoff your throw to the plate on a tagging runner and you know you can throw at a good line to the plate, ignore him.)\n\n, Likewise, if the ball is thrown to second base, back up the second baseman, just in case he doesn't field the throw correctly.\n\n, Call for the ball, relax, and try to follow the flight of the ball. At first back up a couple of steps. It is easier to come in on a ball than try to run backwards.\n\n,, Don't have your arm extended the entire time. Put your glove out when you are positioned under the ball or when you are ready to extend for the catch.\n\n, Try to position yourself so that you merely have to pull your arm back to throw, rather than having to turn your body.\n\n, If you miss, retrieve it, and throw it to the cutoff man near second base.\n\n, Everyone misses once in a while, including the pros. Never give up. (Remember, too, when you see others make mistakes that the same thing will happen to you sometimes. Respect others, and cheer others on.)\n\n, Be prepared for a ground ball, and know what to do with it in every situation.\n\n, Depending on how many runners are on base you will field differently. If there are no runners, field it like an infielder would. If there are runners and you might throw someone out, either charge and field it while running or kneel and field it between your legs to prevent it from getting by.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119011}
{"text":" During a pitch you will need to fully utilize your motion to produce as much power behind the ball as possible. Part of keeping the full force behind the ball involves properly positioning your fingers during the pitch. Keep some of these tips in mind when pitching:Keep fingers behind the ball at all times. Avoid curling your hand or fingers in front of or to the side of the ball as you throw it.\nHold the ball using your thumb, pointer, and index fingers.\nYour fingers should be placed across the horseshoe stitching, running parallel with it.\nThis grip can also help with accuracy and consistency when throwing pitches.;\n, Even though you may train often enough and have adequate strength, pitching the ball without any consistency will prevent you from developing more pitching velocity. Consistent training is a key element of your practice that will help you develop faster pitching velocity.Try recording your practice sessions and analyzing your technique.\nCoaches will often be able to help you analyze and improve your consistency.\n\n, Long toss will train your pitching skills by gradually increasing the amount of distance you are throwing the ball. It's a good technique to drill your throwing mechanics at different levels of intensity, improve power and velocity, and grant you familiarity with the motion of pitching in many circumstances. Follow this basic long toss training routine to start improving the power and technique of your pitches:Warm up by simply playing catch or other light activity.\nThrow the ball around 60' feet for about four minutes.\nMove up to throwing the ball at 90' feet for three minutes.\nFor two minutes, throw the ball at 130'.\nMaximize the distance by throwing the ball between 160-180' for two minutes.\nBring it back down to throwing at 45' for one minute as a cool down.\n\n, It may be tempting to think of pitching as solely and upper body motion or technique. However, proper pitching that yields high velocity throws will require your entire body to work together in one fluid motion. This concept is know as the kinetic chain and it's something you should keep in mind when practicing technique.Inefficiency or weakness in one motion or body part can weaken the entire pitch.\nThe entire body must work together in order to generate more effective and powerful pitches.\n\n, When you are pitching you will be using your entire body. This movement will require you to fully commit to the motion and use your maximum effort to throw the ball as fast as you can. Make sure you are using the full motion and torso rotation to maximize the velocity of your pitches.Higher speeds of torso, hip and shoulder rotation will increase pitching velocity.\nCommit to improving and training your technique and mechanics.\n\n, The main source of velocity in a pitch will come from keeping your arm and hand directly behind the ball. Only at the very end of the pitching motion should you use your wrist to snap the ball. Always remember to keep your arm and hand directly behind the ball to build more velocity behind your pitches.Rotating your wrist too early will take away some of the force behind the ball.\nKeep your hand, wrist, and arm straight when pitching.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119012}
{"text":" Before the pitch is even thrown, you should be standing a ready position. Stand on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent and your glove in front of you. Focus on your attention on the batter. As the batter strikes the ball, keep your eye on it the entire time.;\n, You'll only have a few seconds to react once the ball is hit, so you've got to be able to reflexively move toward the ball if its yours to field. Some fielders find it helpful to sway from side to side a bit as they wait for the hit. Shifting your weight back and forth can help you feel ready to spring toward the ball quickly.\n\n, When the ball is hit, run as fast as you can to get in front of it. The angle at which you run is dependent on how fast the ball is moving. Here are a few different scenarios:\n\n\nIf it's a slow moving ball, you might want to charge it. This means running toward the ball at an angle that will help you reach it as quickly as possible.\nIf the ball is hit hard and low, it will respond violently to imperfections on the ground. Reaching the ball as quickly as possible is a good way to prevent it from bouncing away from you or at you in a harmful, unexpected way.\nIf it's a very fast moving ball, it's more important to run at an angle that will give you time to field the ball with ease, rather than having to dive or stretch your glove at an odd angle. Instead of running toward the ball, run to one side or the other so you can get in position to have the ball coming right at your glove.\nWith practice, you'll be able to discern what approach is right for what grounder speed. Timing is everything when it comes to fielding grounders.\n\n, Grounders can be difficult to field because each hop they take can make them bounce in an unpredictable direction. Your best bet is to try to field a grounder on as long a hop as possible, because you'll know just where to position your glove to catch it. Fielding a grounder on a short hop is more difficult, because you have less time to react to the ball's bounce. If you let it bounce right in front of your glove, it could easily hop over your shoulder or to your left or right, forcing you to fumble.\n\n\nTry to time your fielding so that the ball won't hop right in front of your glove. Catch it after it has hopped several feet away, so you have time to move toward it and catch it.\nIf the ball does hop right in front of you, you'll need to have very quick reflexes to catch it. Keep your body in front of the ball. If it skips off your glove, you might be able to stop it with your foot or another body part - anything to keep it from getting past you!\n\n, It's most comfortable to field the ball on the same side of your body as your glove hand. If your right hand is your glove hand, try to position yourself so that the ball is moving slightly toward your right side. If your left hand is your glove hand, position yourself so you can catch it on that side.\n\n\nYou should still be fairly square with the ball, however. Try to not to put yourself in the position of needing to dive or stretch your arm to catch it.\nIf the ball is traveling extremely fast, you won't always have time to get in the ideal fielding position. You may need to dive, stretch, or backhand it to make the catch.\n\n, When the ball is nigh, it's time to get low. If you don't, you stand a very good chance of having it fly between your legs - the most embarrassing fielder's error. Drop into a crouch that'll let you move quickly if you need to catch the ball on a short bounce.\n\n, Here's where hand-eye coordination comes into play. Extend your glove toward the ball, keeping your elbow slightly bent. Position your glove so that the ball will roll or hop right into it.\n\n\nA common mistake fielders make is not keeping their glove down. It is easier to bring the glove up than to get it down quickly, so keeping your glove in a low position provides better coverage., Make sure it's not in the path of the ball, but it should be close enough that you can easily employ it if need be. Two hands are better than one, so your other hand should be ready to trap the ball when it meets your glove.\n\n, The number one rule in baseball, keep your eye on the ball, applies as much to fielding as it does to hitting. Make sure to watch the ball until it's safely nestled in your glove, and be ready to move if it does something unexpected.\n\n, When the ball is in your glove, close your glove tight and immediately trap the ball with your opposite hand. This puts you in the perfect position to throw the ball where it needs to go as quickly as possible.\n\n, When the ball is secure, immediately transfer it to your throwing hand. If you used your throwing hand to trap the ball, you can simply grasp the ball using the right grip to quickly throw it. If you fielded the ball with your glove stretched to one side or if you caught it backhanded, bring your glove to your throwing hand and grab the ball.Practice getting a good grip on the ball. Without looking, practice quickly gripping the ball by the seams. Developing this reflex means your throw will more likely be on-target and easy to catch.\nThe ball transfer should be done deliberately and quickly. There's still room for fumbling after you've successfully fielded the ball, so the transfer needs to be practiced just as much. Work on your ball transfer. Practice transferring your ball from your glove to your throwing hand. In the dugout when there's nothing to do, or anytime you have a ball handy, practice.\n\n, Now it's time to quickly get in position to throw the ball. Rise up and step forward with your throwing foot, then with your non-throwing foot, then again with your throwing foot as you throw the ball. Doing these steps quickly results in a quick sequence that looks like skipping. It allows you to get your body in the right position to make an effective throw.\n\n, After the flurry of fielding the ball, make sure you stay focused enough to make a good throw. A wild throw will completely negate your good fielding efforts. Throw a solid line drive to the appropriate fielder to make a good play.\n\n\nYou can also practice throwing from a crouched position, for times when you don't have enough time to rise and do a proper through.\nIn other cases you may need to toss or flick the ball to another fielder.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119013}
{"text":" Your normal position is squatting behind home. When doing this, your left foot should be a little bit in front of your right foot (an inch or two). Your left arm (catching arm) should be bent a little at the elbow. Avoid holding your elbow on the inside of your left knee.\n\n\nStraddle the plate, but do not block it. You should allow an open lane to the plate. The only time you can block the plate is when you have the ball in hand.;\n, It is very important that you keep your glove as still as possible from the time the ball hits your glove until the umpire makes the call. Moving your glove even slightly can cause a good strike to be a ball., At all times during the game, you need to keep your eyes on the ball. Without watching the ball, you won\u2019t be able to position yourself appropriately to catch the ball. In addition, you could put yourself in danger of being struck by the ball or the bat.\n\n, Before catching a ball, you need to relax your arm. If your arm isn't relaxed, the impact of the ball could hurt you. After you relax your arm, focus on where the ball is headed.\n\n, Once you've identified the height at which the ball is approaching, you should position your arm appropriately and open your mitt. In addition:\n\nIf you know the pitcher is pitching high, position your arm and glove high.\nYou\u2019ll want to move your whole body to receive the pitch (not just your glove). This will help you better catch it. This tactic is known as swaying.\nDon\u2019t move while the pitcher is throwing. You\u2019ll distract them.\nIf the ball is a definite strike, make sure to extend your arm and catch it with a straight elbow., To best throw out runners, you\u2019ll need to practice quickly moving from the squatting position to your feet. Practice quickly bouncing from a squatting or kneeling position to a standing position. To do this, use your legs to spring upward.\n\nWhen trying to throw out a runner, make sure to use proper footwork. You should catch the ball and crow hop in place. Catching the ball and then taking a step and throwing it gives the runner an extra second., After catching a ball, you\u2019ll have to hone your skills at transferring it to your throwing hand so you can out runners. This is because you\u2019ll need to quickly deliver a ball you\u2019ve caught to the first, second, or third basemen (or others).\n\nWhile transferring the ball from glove to throwing hand, make sure not to bring your glove all the way back to your shoulder. You should catch the ball, make a quarter turn, and take the ball out. If you bring the glove all the way back it makes the transfer a lot harder and you'll frequently have to double clutch.\n\n, Framing the ball is a tactic of making it so the umpire can see the ball from a certain angle. Framing is often used when it might be ambiguous as to whether the ball is a strike or is not. There are several keys to framing a pitch:\n\n\nGive the umpire a view of the ball from the angle that makes it look like a strike. Do this by moving your body and hands slightly. For example, if the pitch could be a ball or strike, try to catch the outside of the ball and slightly twist your wrist as you move your arm outward.\nMove your arm and glove forward a couple inches after you catch it., If you think a ball will hit the dirt and bounce, you need to quickly position yourself to get the ball. Try to move yourself slightly toward the ball. In addition, position your legs so you can quickly spring toward the ball.\n\n\nYou may need to drop to your knees so you can better lean in toward the ball.\nDepending on the trajectory of the ball, you may need to duck your chin down to protect your neck.\nDon\u2019t move too much. You could wind up getting hit by the ball or the bat., Much like with catching dirt balls, acquiring a ball that falls a little short of you is very important. The quicker you get the ball, the quicker you can stop your opponents from advancing. To scoop the ball, move toward it and scoop downward with your glove and use your throwing hand to direct the ball into your glove., When it comes to catching pop ups and fouls, you\u2019ll have to quickly remove your helmet, stand up, and catch the ball. This is important, as it will give you the mobility and the ability to see the ball.\n\n, As a catcher, you\u2019ll have provide hand signs to the rest of your team about possible defensive plays. Signs may vary, as you don\u2019t want the opposite team to know what you\u2019re going to do. Some signs include:\n\n\nOne finger for a fast ball, two fingers for a curve ball, three fingers for a slider, and four fingers or wiggle fingers for a changeup., You and the pitcher are fundamentally a team within the larger team. To properly collaborate, you\u2019ll need to forge real communication with the pitcher. Be sure they know your hand signs. In addition, know which type of balls your pitcher can throw the best.\n\n, In many ways, the pitcher is a defensive coordinator for the team. As a pitcher, you\u2019ll need to be able to effectively communicate with your team mates and to send them signals during the game. You\u2019ll also have to be supportive and mentor weaker players.\n\nTalk to your teammates before the game.\nAvoid making defensive success or failure about any one person. Encourage everything to work together as a team.\n\n, To be a successful leader and catcher, you\u2019ll need to observe and talk to your teammates to find out their strengths and weaknesses. Without knowing these, you won\u2019t be able to mount a proper defense.\n\n\nFocus your attention on pitchers and basemen., As catcher, you\u2019ll have a large responsibility in planning your team\u2019s defense. You\u2019ll have a say in which players are on the bases, you\u2019ll be able to give your basemen a sense of where and who they should throw balls to, and more. As a result, take the time to reflect on your overall defense.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119014}
{"text":" The object is to create resistance and a change in the uniform weight of the ball to make its motion more unpredictable and difficult to hit. There's no \"right place\" to put it, since the object is unpredictability, as with a knuckleball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, scratching the ball with a file or sandpaper can be a similarly-effective way of messing with the weight and the trajectory. It's still illegal, but it's a possibility.\nSince the friction between your fingers and the ball gives the ball its spin, you can also keep the goop on your finger while you throw. Something slippery, like spit, will reduce the friction of the pitch, achieving a similar effect. It's not illegal to lick your fingers before throwing a pitch.;\n, There's no specific technique to the spitball that's different than a regular fastball. Throw a fastball as you normally would, using the same grip and technique, though the result should have action similar to that of a knuckleball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've just got some wetness on your fingers when you pitch, it might be somewhat more difficult to control, slipping out of your hand as opposed to rolling out as with a normal fastball. It may take some practice to get used to the feeling.\n\n, A forkball or a split-finger fastball are legal pitches that behave in much the same way, looking at first like traditional fastballs but then behaving unpredictably, often slowing and sinking at the last minute when thrown correctly. In a forkball, the ball is seated more deeply between the forked fingers, whereas the split-finger fastball is a more modern and comfortable version of the same pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the great diversity of off-speed pitches available to the pitching repertoire, it's recommended to always favor some other pitch, as opposed to relying upon an illegal spitball to strike out your opponents. It's a fun thing to learn for novelty's sake, but you can't and shouldn't use it in a game.\n\n, Sometimes called a \"spitball from God,\" the ball will behave somewhat differently, offering sharper breaking trajectories for the pitcher in damp conditions. Pitching in areas with a high humidity will offer a similar effect, as well as pitches in slightly drizzly rain conditions. If it's wet out, you'll be throwing spitball whether you like it or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Historically, one of the most popular ways to get away with applying an illegal substance to the ball was to dab a little bit of vaseline or personal lubricant on the inside brim of your hat in the dugout. Before pitching, readjust your cap slightly and take a little of the substance off with your thumb and apply it to the ball before pitching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Less common, but still effective is the technique of rubbing a little vaseline on the inside lip of your glove and dabbing it on when you've got the ball in your mitt. Be sure to only use as small an amount as possible and use your spitball judiciously if you decide to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, It's possible to \"accidentally\" rub up against some vaseline in the dugout and end up with a small amount on the back of your leg. If you, say, scratched the back of your leg and ended up with some on your fingers before a pitch, well, that wouldn't be your fault. Right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Nail files, emery boards, or even small pieces of sandpaper are sometimes hidden in the glove, or cupped in the finger during a pitch to scratch the ball and affect the trajectory like a spitball. \"Double Duty\" Radcliffe, a pitcher in the '30s, used to hide a nail file in his belt buckle during games to scratch the ball on as he prepared for a pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, In the gray area of legality is the greasy-hair pitch. If you've got some dirty locks, you can get your head a little damp with a small amount of water before heading to the mound, then take off your cap and run the fingers of your pitching hand through your hair before pitching. The grease from your hair will be wet enough to come off easily and can affect the ball significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The penalty for throwing a single spitball can be expulsion from the game, and even the league. As recently as the '80s, MLB pitches have been suspended and fined after being caught with scuffing objects on their person while on the field. Again, it's a fun thing to try in the backyard or in the sandlot, but don't try it in a game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119015}
{"text":" Read the situation presented before you. A catcher must know how many runners are in position, how many are out, and if possible, what the likelihood is that the baserunners will steal. This will change how you set up your footwork, what kind of pitch you will call, or whether or not you should call for your pitcher to pick-off.;\n, Before the pitch is thrown in a throwdown situation, you must be in position to make sure you can get a quick throw off. Your throwing foot should be half a foot further ahead than your back foot, to help reduce time in getting your footwork together. Depending on the situation, you should determine how close or far your should be to the plate. In a situation where there is a right-handed batter and a man possibly stealing third, it is best to line up slightly further from the plate in order to throw behind the batter. This would give you a clear target to third base to get the best possible throw off.\n\n, There are several different ways to learn how to set up your feet for a throw down. I suggest setting up as shown earlier, and then proceeding as such. The first step is to make sure that you secure the ball in your glove before you worry about the throw to second. From here, make sure you cut down the amount of steps you take with the ball. As you receive the ball plant your front foot towards the base your throwing to and release as quickly as possible. Avoid shuffling at all costs, as the longer you are holding the ball, the more time the runner has to get to the base.\n\n, Getting the ball out of your hand quickly is more important than how hard you actually throw the ball. As the ball is about to make impact with your glove, place your throwing hand directly behind your glove to create the fastest possible transfer time. Once you've caught the ball, bring the ball straight behind you and time your throw with your footwork. Follow through with your throw to throw as hard as possible and to reduce the chance of injury.\n\n, If the man covering the base isn't at the base yet, he will be, so get your throw off and let him worry about his job. Most commonly, runners are trying to steal second, so we will focus on the primary targets there. A common mistake is to try to hit the glove of the man covering the base, which is difficult because it's a moving target. Common places to aim where your throwing is at the pitchers head or directly at the base. Keep your throw low and on your right side of the base to help apply an easy tag on the runner.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119016}
{"text":" Grip the baseball with your index and middle fingers placed tightly together across an outer seam of the ball located at the horseshoe or U-shape seam. For right-handers, place your middle finger across the right half of the seam. Left-handers should do the opposite: place your middle finger across the left half of the seam. This should position your fingers towards the outside of the ball (off-center).;\n, Place your thumb under the opposite inside seam of the ball. The further your thumb is from your other 2 fingers, the more the pitch will drop. The closer your thumb is to your other two fingers, the more it will slide. If your index and middle fingers are at a 10 or 11 o'clock position, your thumb should be at a 4 or 5 o'clock position.\n\n, Hold the pitch so that the most pressure comes from the thumb-side of your index finger.The key to gripping a slider is holding the outer third of the ball.\n\n\nPutting pressure on your both your index and middle fingers will cause the pitch to balance out, or become a cutter.\n\n, Most pitchers do this to ensure that the ball releases on the thumb-side of your index finger. The movement of this pitch comes from the ball spinning off your fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid twisting your wrist. Twisting your wrist can cause injury over time.\n\n, If the batter can see your grip before the pitch, chances are they will be more prepared for what you are about to throw at them. Hide your grip in your glove to keep players on the other team unaware of the slider you are about to throw., Pivot and shift your body weight from the back foot forward toward home plate. Follow through with your motion. Your feet should be parallel at the end of the pitch and your throwing arm should come across the front of your body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Remember to have it cocked slightly, but resist the urge to twist it (side to side) it when you release the pitch. As you release, apply pressure with just your index finger to ensure a late break.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry not to drive your wrist forward with more than an adequate amount of force.\n\n, Snap your wrist (up to down) to make the ball drop as it crosses the plate. Remember to let the spin of the slider come from your index finger releasing from the ball, not a twisting of your wrist. Snapping is an up and down motion, while twisting is a side to side motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Prepare to come right down through with your wrist, just like you would with a fastball. The greater the angle created by turning the fingers, the wider the break on the slider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The slider is an effective pitch whether thrown to same side or opposite side hitters. However, the slider looses its effectiveness if it's thrown directly over the plate. The success of the slider is its ability to break at the last minute and catch the batter off guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA left-handed pitcher's slider should break down and away from left-handed hitters, and down and in on right-handed hitters.\nA right-handed pitcher's slider should break down and away from right-handed hitters, and down and in on left-handed hitters.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119017}

Although the knuckleball was originally thrown with the knuckles pointing into the ball rather than the finger tips, this is not as effective. You're trying to reduce the amount of spin you put on the ball. Grabbing the ball with your knuckles may cause the ball to rotate more than necessary.

{"text":" Before attempting a slap bunt, try to work on getting the footwork perfect, as it is the most important aspect of the technique. Most players will take a jab step backwards while anticipating the pitch, and then cross over with the left foot when entering the swing. Practice this motion without a bat before trying to slap bunt in practice.;\n, Position your feet slightly open towards right field, as this will make for an easier transition when you start running towards first base.\n\n, Move your hands a few inches up the bat handle in order to get a better feel.\n\n, When the ball is pitched, slide your front foot back towards the rear foot and the rear foot crosses over and becomes the first step towards first base.\n\n, It is important to keep the lower body opened up towards the left side of the infield through the swing.\n\n, Make sure your shoulders are still square to the pitcher, even while swinging. This is an important step to master, as many ballplayers have trouble getting the hang of this.\n\n, Don't chop at the ball. Chopping reduces the time the bat stays in the plane of the pitch and so reduces the chance of contact.\n\n, Let the barrel of the bat trail your hands slightly so that you hit the inside of the ball which will result in a hit to the left side of the infield. #Start running. When the pitch comes, already start running to first with your bat out. Watch film of stars like Ichiro Suzuki begin striding even as they make contact.\n\n, Drop the bat as quickly as possible, as the added weight will slow you down.\n\n, Focus on keeping your head from bobbing when running.

{"text":" Don't attempt this until you have mastered the fastball and changeup.You can learn the slurve without knowing the curveball or slider, but many people consider the slurve less useful to master than those two pitches.Curveballs and slurves probably cause more injuries than other pitches, although not as many as commonly believed.Most players are told not to try this until they turn fourteen years old.;\n, Place your middle finger on the right seam or just outside it. Place your index finger touching your middle finger.If one seam stands higher on the ball than the other, grip that one with your middle finger. This will give you a better grip, since your middle finger is responsible for most of a slurve grip.As usual, keep your fourth and fifth fingers bent at the side of the ball, barely touching it.\n\n, Place your thumb on the left seam at the lower side of the ball. Do not bend your thumb.This is similar to the four seam fastball grip, but with your thumb closer to your index finger.\n\n, Your index finger should barely press against the ball. Put a bit more pressure on the middle finger, but keep it gentle., Throw a hard \u00be pitch, as you would a slider (or a four seam fastball if you don't know how to throw a slider). As you extend your arm, rotate at the elbow. Just before you release the ball, the back of your hand should be facing outward., Snapping your wrist as you throw will create a more significant downward break.Start with your wrist slightly cocked, but not stiff. At the moment you release the ball, snap the wrist downward so the back of your hand turns to face home plate.This variation has a considerable risk of injury. Practice with slow pitches first, and consider wrist-strengthening exercises. Most baseball pitchers do not recommend snapping your wrist until you are at least fourteen years old.\nIf you decide to practice without the wrist movement, don't try to compensate with faster elbow snapping, which can also cause injury., Keep your hand moving across your body and down to the opposite knee.\n\n, This odd, hybrid pitch can be unpredictable for the pitcher as well. You'll get a better idea of how your slurve breaks as you practice. For now, try aiming behind the batter's back (if the batter is a righty).Keep an eye on where the ball travels, or have a friend stand behind the batter and advise you on how to adjust your aim.\n\n, A successful slurve is faster than a curveball and dips down slightly, but mostly breaks towards the pitcher's glove side like a slider. This won't be as fast as a slider, or break downward as much as a curveball, but it's a compromise that works well for some pitchers.\n\n\nBecause a slurve is a hybrid pitch, fans have trouble agreeing over the exact break. Most agree that a slurve breaks from 2 to 8 o'clock or from 3 to 8 o'clock., The slurve is a controversial pitch, since it's right in the middle of the spectrum. You won't be pitching your best speeds, but you won't get the most dramatic break either. Like all pitches, this is best used when the batter doesn't expect it. Try pitching a few sliders, then switching to a slurve for one pitch.\n\n\nIf a batter isn't used to a slurve, you can sometimes find success pitching it repeatedly. After a certain level, though, players are ready for the slurve and unlikely to be stymied by this tactic.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119020}
{"text":" Place your feet shoulder width apart or slightly wider. Your feet should be parallel to one another and aligned directly under your shoulders. If you\u2019re right handed, your left side should be facing the pitcher, with your head pointed in the direction the ball will be coming from. If you\u2019re left handed, it will be your right side. Above all, your stance should be comfortable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResting on the balls of your feet will make your movements quicker and your stance more reactive.;\n, Bend your knees and sink into the balls of your feet. Don\u2019t crouch or stoop too low\u2014make sure there is a little spring in your knees and hips. A lower center of gravity will help you generate force in your swing and stabilize you while you\u2019re batting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to adopt a steady, grounded stance to keep from compromising your balance.\nDon\u2019t stick out your butt or let your upper body lean too far.\n\n, Keep both feet firmly rooted on the ground until you\u2019re ready to start your swing. The more steady your stance, the more power you\u2019ll be able to produce by driving from the feet up. As you begin the swing, you will take a small step with your front foot and twist the back foot to follow through, but up until you make contact with the ball, both feet should be locked in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour weight should be positioned very slightly over your rear foot to prepare you to step into your swing later on.\n\n, Relax your muscles and prepare to move your body in one fluid motion. If you\u2019re tense, your movements will be erratic and your speed and precision will suffer. Shake out your shoulders, hips and ankles before stepping up to bat. Remind yourself to remain loose and poised rather than bunching up.Sports research has found that athletes move much faster and more smoothly when they are relaxed., To get an effective grip, lay the handle of the bat across the fingers of both hands, then wrap your hands around the bat. Don\u2019t hold the bat in the palms, as this doesn\u2019t allow you to flex and rotate your wrists as well when you swing. Keep a light grip on the bat until the moment you make contact with the ball to maximize your speed and reactivity.Don\u2019t grip too high on the handle of the bat; this can blunt your swing. There should be very little space between the pinky finger of your bottom hand and the bottom knob.\nAlways think of gripping the bat with the fingers, not the whole hand.\n\n, Keep the tops of your fingers in one long row down the grip of the bat. The bat will shift in your hands as you swing, and both hands will naturally turn on the handle. Use the pressure of your fingers to steady the bat, but don\u2019t grip it too tightly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it isn\u2019t comfortable to hold the bat with the tops of your knuckles aligned, try turning your hands inward until your middle knuckles point in the same direction. This is known as a \u201cbox grip.\u201d\n\n, Let the bat point upwards at an angle over your shoulder rather than resting it flat across your back. Keep the bat raised off your shoulder, ready to begin the swing. At no point should any part of the bat touch your back, neck or shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe angle at which you hold the bat should be around or just over 45 degrees.\nIt\u2019s easier to enter into the swing quickly if there\u2019s already some muscular tension on the bat. Your swing will be much more sluggish if you\u2019re trying to move the bat from a dead stop.\n\n, Situate your center of gravity over your feet and keep your toes, knees, hips and shoulders aligned. Point your chin toward the mound to have an eye on the ball at all times. From this position, you will explode and uncoil once the ball is within hitting distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any part of your body deviates from your linear stance, you will sacrifice speed, power and control.\n\n, Once the ball leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand, step out very slightly with the front foot. Only move the foot 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6\u00a0cm), and be careful not to come out of alignment or lose tightness in your core as you step. This will increase the power of your swing by adding directional force to the motion of the hips and shoulders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful not to throw off your balance as you step. The step should be quick, short and leave you in a position with a solid base to hit the ball.\n\n, With one quick motion, rotate the hips to create momentum for the swing. Don\u2019t let the hips sway or move out of alignment with the rest of your body as you swivel. If you\u2019re right handed, you should turn your hips counterclockwise, and clockwise for left handed batters. Most of the power of a good swing originates at the hips.The swing should begin with the hips, with the shoulders following closely behind. A lot of injuries occur when players try to \u201cmuscle\u201d the ball with a wrenching motion of the shoulders.\nTry to stay upright as you rotate so you don\u2019t come off your axis.\n\n, Drop your chin and keep your head held low throughout your swing. Your line of sight should be locked onto the ball at all times, from the beginning of the pitch to the moment that either the bat touches the ball or you strike out. Stay focused and get ready to time your swing. Lowering your chin will help keep your head in alignment with the rest of your body, as you will be hunched over and bent at the waist slightly while preparing to bat.Don't tilt your head too much when dropping your chin. If your eyes are not level, it may throw off your perspective and compromise your ability to zero in on the ball.During batting practice, pay close attention to the path that the ball takes to get better at tracking it as it moves toward you.\n\n, Bring your shoulders across your body, following the hips. Remain relaxed until just before the bat strikes the ball. The entire body should uncoil like a spring, from the feet up through the hips, ending with the turn of the shoulders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shaft of the bat should stay in tight during the first part of the swing. As a rule, the further the tip of the bat is from the body, the less leverage you have., After you\u2019ve struck the ball, continue driving through the swing until the bat is extended over your opposite shoulder. At the end of your rotation your upper body should be facing the pitcher. A good follow through will put extra heat on the ball to smash it out of the park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing through makes the most of the momentum of rotation, stopping the forward movement of the ball and sending it back with as much power as possible.\nSome players prefer to keep both hands on the bat as they follow through, while others release their top hand and let the bat continue swinging like a backhand. Try out both methods, but do whatever feels most comfortable to you.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119021}

Think of taking the knob at the end of the bat and swinging it on the same path as the ball.\n\n\nYour lower hand also helps you get speed, but do no try to \u201cpull\u201d the bat forward. Your hips are driving the bat forward and your hands are helping guide it.\n\n, Your top arm keeps your swing quick and compact. Begin to tuck your elbow in towards your chest to shorten your swing, driving the bat quickly through the ball.Make sure your elbow stays behind your hands as you tuck it in. You want your hands to lead the bat.\n\n, You want to keep swinging through the ball, not stopping after making contact, to get real power. As you make contact, imagine that there are two more balls right behind it that you need to hit as well. Your momentum will take the bat around your body as your weight shifts forward.\n\n, Home run balls need backspin to help them fly longer. There are two good ways to get backspin:\n\n\nStay on the inside of the ball. Keep your swing compact and think of hitting the half of the ball closer to your body.\nHit down on the lower two-thirds of the ball. This lifts the ball and spins it backwards off the bat, allowing it to cruise towards the bleacher seats. You might feel like you are almost \u201cchopping\u201d at the ball, but the trick is to catch the bottom two-thirds of the ball to get power.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119023}
{"text":" This is a two-seam screwball grip; countless other grips can be used to throw the screwball, but this is probably what beginners should start off with. Be sure to hold both index and middle fingers together in your grip.\n\n\nPut your pointer finger on the seams. This way, it has more traction or grip on the ball, creating a bigger break when you actually throw the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrip the baseball so that your two fingers cross the bottom part of the horseshoe. Again, the more traction you create when the baseball leaves your hand, the more likely it is to dip to curve if thrown with the proper mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Mimicking the motion of the fastball is important here. You want to disguise your pitch until the last possible second so that the batter doesn't know in advance what kind of a pitch you are throwing.\n\n, The screwball is the reverse-curveball. If thrown by a rightie, it breaks down and away from lefties. To get this kind of spin on the ball, you want to turn your wrist counter-clockwise if you're a right handed pitcher.\n\n, Think of pulling down the ball with your pointer finger as you release it. This should give the ball better curve and slice.\n\n, The screwball may be a devastating pitch to batters, but it's also gained a reputation for being a devastating pitch for pitchers. That's because the wrist action that pitchers need to perform in order to throw it can be difficult to repeat and puts undue stress on the wrist and arm. Pitchers who specialize in the screwball often find that the torque generated by throwing it is uncomfortable, especially after having had surgery.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119024}
{"text":" Grip the ball like you would grip a four-seam fast ball. Place your index and middle fingers an inch apart across the seams.

Your glove hand should be pulling your shoulder toward the target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotate the arm counter-clockwise behind you. Your arm should be making a circular motion.\n\n, The Secret of the Demon Miracle Pitch emphasizes the importance of hip and shoulder unison. Practice the unwinding motion several times before throwing the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Rotate your arm away from the body. After you have pulled the arm back, rotate your arm forward and away from the body with your palm facing third base for a right-handed pitcher and first base for a left-handed pitcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitching arm will come forward and down so that the back of your hand will face you.\n\n, Make sure that the palm of your hand faces away from you with the thumb toward the ground.

{"text":" A palmball differs from a fastball largely due to its placement in the hand which is why learning the correct form is so important.You want to begin by holding the ball with the horseshoe curve facing toward the plate.\n\n\nIf you are right-handed, grasp the ball with the middle finger on the top left part of the ball and with your ring finger on the top right.\nIf you are left-handed, grasp the ball with the middle finger on the top right part of the ball and with your ring finger on the top left.;\n, You want to be sure that the ball is firmly gripped in the palm of your hand to create the maximum off-speed effect., You want to evenly distribute your fingers around the ball so that they are not touching any of the seams. Place your thumb directly on the bottom of the ball while still avoiding the seam.Apply pressure on the ball using your thumb to keep it firmly in your palm.\n\n, Applying even pressure on the ball is a vital aspect of throwing a palmball correctly. If the pressure is evenly distributed and the ball remains tightly lodged into your palm, you will likely have more control of the speed and direction the ball goes in.\n\n, Use the same rotation as you do for a fastball motion to increase the likelihood of fooling the batter. Though you will be using the same throwing motion as you do for a fastball, your grip will take a lot of velocity off of the pitch.When releasing the ball, be sure to open your hand as wide as possible. This will ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally brush any of the seams, which could interfere with the trajectory of the ball.Be sure not to snap your wrist as you release the ball.\n\n, Following through involves letting the natural momentum of your hand movement take its complete course. After pitching the ball, allow your arm to follow through until it comes back to your waist.\n\n\nThough this step seems like a minor detail, failure to follow through on your pitch could interfere with the trajectory of your palmball., This is the most obvious way to perfect your palmball technique. Find a buddy who is willing to play catch with you and get out there and throw palmballs until the technique becomes second nature to you.\n\n\nIf you have any friends who play baseball or a coach, ask them to observe and give you feedback. If they have a lot of experience in throwing palmballs, they may also be able to demonstrate in person and you can follow along.\n\n, Pitching drills are important for improving your accuracy. After all, throwing a palmball isn\u2019t much use if you can\u2019t get the ball to go towards the precise location you are aiming for.\n\n\nThere are a variety of pitching drills you can practice to improve your skills. For example, you can do kneeling partner pitches (if you have someone to practice with). For this drill, both players kneel on the ground with gloves but only one ball.\nStart by standing about 10 feet apart from each other and simply pitch back and forth. The goal is to pitch with such accuracy that the catcher does not have to extend his arms out to his sides to catch the ball.You can also make this drill more challenging by standing further apart from each other.\n\n, Recording and then watching you practice throwing palmballs will allow you to study and refine your technique. Oftentimes we don\u2019t notice small mistakes in our posture, gripping, or pitching and all of these are crucial to throwing excellent palmballs.\n\n\nNext time you practice, set up a recorder or have someone record you on their phone to study your own technique and modify accordingly.\n\n, There are many famous pitchers who use the palmball technique during games, such as Trevor Hoffman, Steve Farr, and Roy Halladay. Try looking up videos online of professional baseball players who have used this technique and watch closely.\n\n\nYou can watch for specific details or styles that the different baseball players employ and then emulate them later in your own practice.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119026}
{"text":" There are two primary grips for the fastball: the four-seam and the two-seam. The four-seam generally gathers more velocity but some pitchers find the two-seam more comfortable and easier to command.Many experienced pitchers will switch between the two options when they want to emphasize velocity or movement respectively but you should stick with one until you\u2019re fully comfortable with it.\n\n\nFor the four-seam grip, place your index and middle fingers across the seams where they form a horse-shoe shape with a comfortable amount of space between them. Have your ring and pinky fingers close together and your thumb gently resting underneath the ball.The two-seam grip involves the same general configuration of your fingers but with the index and middle finger following along the seams where they are close together. Once you\u2019ve mastered the two-seam grip, your fastball should have some movement toward your pitching hand\u2019s side of the plate (i.e. a right handed pitcher\u2019s two-seam fastball with break inside on a right-handed hitter).;\n, You should be generating the majority of your power from your lunging motion toward the plate.\n\n\nThe pitching mound is elevated for a reason. After you lift your step leg, use the momentum of your body falling forward to generate power for your pitch.Determine the ideal spot for your step foot to land so that you\u2019re maximizing your forward momentum without overextending. Practice hitting that spot with your foot until it\u2019s second nature. You may even want to practice your lunge motion without actually pitching the ball so you can focus on it.\n\n, If you rigidly stop your pitching motion as soon as you release the ball, you\u2019ll lose some velocity and accuracy.Your pitching hand should end up near your hip on the opposite side of your body.\n\n, One of the most ubiquitous and confusing pieces of advice you\u2019ll hear from baseball coaches is that you shouldn\u2019t aim your pitches. This is not meant to imply that you shouldn\u2019t care about where your pitch lands. However, if you\u2019re overly focused on guiding the pitch to a specific spot in the zone, it will compromise the velocity and general effectiveness of the pitch.Pitchers use the term \u2018command\u2019 to describe the approach of using your delivery motion to locate pitches rather than simply aiming the ball. This may sound vague if you\u2019re new to pitching but will make more sense as you work on your technique.\nPoint your step foot toward the inner or outer part of the plate when you\u2019re trying to command the ball to those locations.As you\u2019re developing your delivery, visualize the ball landing in a specific spot and keep practicing until it works. Use the muscle memory of that delivery motion to build your command.Commanding without aiming is one of the more difficult aspects of pitching and even major leaguers can struggle with it. You\u2019ll need a lot of patience and practice.\n\n, While most people associate biceps with arm strength, the most important pitching muscles in your arm are actually the flexor muscles in your forearm and your triceps. Focus on strength-building and flexibility exercises in these areas to build pitching velocity and reduce the risk of injury.Try some reverse barbell curls. Face away from the barbell and grip it with both hands shoulder-length apart from behind your back. Bend your elbows slightly and let your wrists do the work when you curl the barbell up toward your back. Start with a light-weight barbell and a limited number of repetitions before until you\u2019re comfortable increasing. This will build forearm and wrist strength.Try some tricep extensions. You\u2019ll need a cable pulley which is available at most commercial gyms. Grip the rope or handle-bar attachment in front of you and pull it down with your elbows ending up straightened and by your sides. Raise your hands back to the starting position slowly. Start with a light-weight pulley and a small number of repetitions until you\u2019re comfortable increasing., The majority of pitching injuries take place in the shoulder region so building strength and flexibility in this area is essential as you try to ramp up your fastball velocity.Try some shoulder flexions. You\u2019ll need some anchored tubing which is available at most commercial gyms. Stand facing away from the anchor with the tubing in your hands resting at your sides. Extend your arms out in front of your face with your elbows and wrists straight and then return to your starting position. Start with a limited number of repetitions until you\u2019re comfortable increasing., Your arms aren\u2019t the only part of your body you work when pitching. A lot of your power will be derived from your legs, hips and abdomen. Strengthen these areas, collectively known as your \u2018core,\u2019 to maximize your pitching ability.Try some medicine ball rotational throws. You\u2019ll need a medicine ball and a workout partner. Sit on the floor and hold the ball close to your chest with your elbows pointing outward. Keep your legs and lower body still during the exercise and start with your upper body rotated away from your partner. Rotate toward your partner and pass the ball by extending both elbows forward like a basketball pass. Start with a light-weight ball and a limited number of repetitions until you\u2019re comfortable increasing.Try some bicycle crunches. Lay flat on your back with one leg out and both hands on your head. Crunch your opposite knee into your opposite elbow. Start with slow movements and limited repetitions until you\u2019re comfortable increasing.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119027}
{"text":" The forkball is gripped between your middle and index fingers. Start by placing these fingers on the seams in the same way you would if you were throwing a two-seam fast ball., For a forkball you need a very wide grip. So once you have your fingers on the seams you need to try to spread them out even further so they go outside the seams. This will help you grip the ball more deeply between your index and middle finger than an ordinary split-fingered fast ball., With a forkball grip, most of the work is being done by the index and middle fingers. Your thumb should be bent and held under the ball. Your thumb is supporting the ball more than gripping it.\n\n, The two main differences to a split-seam fastball grip are how wide you spread your fingers, and how deep into your grip you hold the ball.When you are holding the ball you will feel how the wider your grip, the further the ball will be pushed into your fingers. You want to jam the ball as deep into your grip as you can comfortably.\n\n, The forkball requires an especially wide grip and as such is easier to pull off if you have long fingers. This is one of the reasons why younger players will find it very difficult to do, and it is generally seen as a pitch to learn once you are fully grown. Some major league teams even actively discourage young players learning it due to the risk of injury.A grip with fingers so far apart puts added stress on the elbow., A forkball is pitched with basically the same arm action as a regular fastball. The wide finger grip is the main factor in producing the forkball's distinctive action which sees it tail off or drop down right at the last minute. Starting with feet shoulder width apart and facing your catcher, get into your wind-up position. When you're ready to pitch bring your arm back as you would for a split-fingered fastball.Shift your weight a little to your left (for right handers), and pivot your right foot so it is beside the rubber and the outside of your foot is pressing against the mound.\nRaise your left leg so your thigh is parallel to the ground or higher. As you do this your body will turn to the right to face third base.\nBring back your throwing arm, while you hold your left arm in front of you with the elbow bent.\n\n, Now it's time to pitch. Keep your grip nice and wide with your thumb beneath the ball for support. You should be using the same action as with a fastball, but with just a slightly stiffer wrist.To keep your wrist stiff, hold it firmly in place and don't allow it to flex or rotate until the snap as you release it.\n\n\nBegin to lower your front leg without allowing it to touch the ground.\nAs you do this, stride out with this leg and begin to swing up your throwing arm.\nLand your front foot at a 75 degree angle to the plate.\nPush off your back foot, and pivot your front foot so it is at a 90 degree angle from the plate.\nAs you do this extend your pitching arm as far as you can.\n\n, When you come to release the ball, it should come out of your hand at the same point and height as a fastball would, with your elbow in a straight line above your shoulder. This makes it harder for the batter to tell that it is a forkball as it leaves your hand. If you manage to get this right, hiding what kind of pitch you are throwing will give the batter less of a chance to react to the pitch's unusual trajectory.\n\n\nAim to have your pitching elbow aligned with your shoulders as you release the ball.\nFollow through with your pitching arm and raise your back leg for more power.\nForkballs are normally thrown hard, just like a fastball, but the changed grip will mean it comes out of the hand at a lower speed., After the wide grip, the second crucial factor for a successful forkball is imparting topspin on the ball as it leaves your hand. You do this by snapping your wrist at the moment you release the ball. If this is done well, it causes the ball to have some topspin, or forward spin, rather than any backspin. The topspin causes the ball to fall downwards as it reaches the batter.Snapping the wrist like this can lead to injury.\n\n, Although a good pitch requires your whole body to work fluidly, you can train specific parts with particular drills. A good drill to do that focuses on your arm action during a pitch are knee throwing drills. If you are right hander, kneel down on your right knee and pitch the ball to a friend from this position.\n\n\nFor lefties do the opposite side.\n\n, A stiff wrist is an important part of what it takes to throw a good forkball, but this can be a tricky thing to practice on its own. A good way to focus on the wrist is to hold up your pitching arm so it is bent at the elbow and the forearm is vertical. Hold it just below the wrist with your glove hand. Keeping your arm in this position, practice throwing the ball with just your wrist and fingers., To try to put it all together, you can practice pitching against a wall. If you mark a target to aim for you will be able to see how much you are managing to get your pitch to bottom out late on. If you have the equipment, you can film your practice pitches to observe in slow motion how your action looks and what sort of movement is being produced on the ball.\n\n\nIf you are struggling with balance, practice holding your balance position, with your front leg raised and your pitching arm back, for a few seconds before pitching.\n\n, Probably the most fun way to do any pitching drill is with friends. Play catch, and throw in some forkballs to try to catch each other out. If your friend is deceived by the ball as it drops down at the last second, you know it is coming along nicely. It's good to practice with a catcher as they will be able to give you good feedback on the flight of the ball.\n\n\nYou can ask a friend, parent or coach to observe your pitch to see if they spot any problems that might be holding you back.\n\n, Remember, this is a pitch that is very hard to master and can lead to injuries. Take it easy with your practices and stop if you start to feel pain in your elbow, wrist or fingers.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119028}
{"text":" Find the part of the seams where the gap between them is narrowest. Lay each finger so it runs parallel with one of the seams. The horseshoe shape of the seams should be opened upward.Experiment with your fingers resting just inside the seams as opposed to directly on top of them. Some pitchers prefer this technique.;\n, Use your thumb to cradle the ball in your hand. Your thumb should run perpendicular across the seams on the bottom of the ball. The fleshy part of your thumb should be in the smooth part between the seams.The exact thumb placement will depend on the size of your hand. If you have large hands, your thumb will extend farther forward than this.\n\n, Use your ring finger to provide balance on the side of the ball. Let your ring finger touch the side of the ball gently and avoid putting too much pressure on this finger. If you press your ring finger against the ball, your throw will be off.\n\n\nYour ring finger mainly provides stability for the ball and can assist in putting spin on the ball.\n\n, As you get your fingers and thumb in place, be sure to situate the ball so it is deep in your hand. Part of the ball should be touching the knuckles closest to your palm and also touching the palm itself.The deeper grip on the ball gives it added power and control. This is different than a four-seam fastball, which tends to be held farther forward in your hand.\n\n, As you hold the ball preparing for the pitch, apply pressure on top with your fingers and under the ball with your thumb. Distribute the pressure equally between your fingers and your thumb.Increase the power of your grip by squeezing a stress ball or a grip-strengthening workout tool when you are finished with pitching practice.\n\n, When you throw a two-seam fastball, wind up in the same way you always do. Be sure to hide the ball in the pocket of your glove so no one sees how you are holding it. A standard baseball wind up means standing with your glove side to the plate, lifting your front leg, and stretching it toward the plate as you throw., One way to work on the spin of the ball is to have your arm angled slightly outward. Imagine a clock is facing toward the plate. Your arm comes right between the 10:00 and 11:00 positions.This is different than other pitches that require your arm to go through the pitch from a straight up position or a side arm position.\n\n, Just before the point of release, press down slightly hard with your index finger. This pressure makes that side of the ball spin faster. Spin is also aided by the way you flip your wrist at the end of the throw.\n\n\nApplying more pressure to the middle finger will cause the ball to spin in the opposite direction.\nThis added pressure differs from the four-seam and other fastball techniques.\n\n, When your arm reaches the point of full extension, release the ball. Snap your wrist down towards the ground and out away from your body. This wrist motion will put spin on the ball cause it to move in a curve toward the plate.If you apply pressure with your middle finger to reverse the spin, you should also snap your wrist inward rather than outward.\nThis is different than a four-seam fastball, in which the wrist flexes forward rather than outward. This flexing motion creates more spin, which gives the ball more curve than a four-seamer.\n\n, The speed of your fastball comes partly from a full extension of your arm. The ball has the greatest possible momentum once your arm reaches its full extension. Be sure to follow through once you release the ball, allowing your arm to fall toward the ground.\n\n\nThe greater curve of a two-seam fastball, as compared to other fastballs, makes it a little hard to control. The flight path is less predictable than a four-seam fastball.\n\n, If you work on the pitch and you can\u2019t get the movement on the ball that you want, adjust one part of the throw at a time. Slide your fingers closer together. Offset the ball a little to the pinky-side or index finger side of your hand. Twist your wrist toward the outside more.\n\n\nEach small adjustment can majorly affect the pitch, so make sure to only try out one adjustment at a time. If you change too much of the technique, you won\u2019t know what aspect helped.\nThere\u2019s no rule that you have to use the pitch a specific way. Take the basic technique and adjust it to fit your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119029}
{"text":" Center your index, middle and ring finger on top of the ball. You'll be moving your pinkie finger and thumb after you get those three fingers positioned correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, This will help you get a firm grip on the ball in the palm of your hand. Some pitchers choose to touch their index fingers and thumbs slightly to get a better feel for the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This will add more friction to the ball. While when you throw a fastball, you'll be pushing the ball with your fingers, making a whipping motion, you won't have that with the changeup. Instead, you'll be using your palm to do most of the work, leaving your fingers limp and avoiding that whipping action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrip the ball deep in the base of your fingers and then turn it over and inward when you release it.\n\n, Once you've positioned the ball correctly, you should throw the ball to your batter, following the same technique you'd use for other pitches: lift your arms and elbows over your head, move them forward, toward the shoulder of the pitching arm, move your throwing arm above and behind you, bend your knees, and throw the ball with the knee on the opposite foot bend while the leg on the side of the throwing arm lifts up as you follow through and cross your throwing arm over your body as you finish off the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove your pitching arm as quickly as you'd move it while throwing a fastball. The beauty is that it will look like the ball will be coming just as quickly as a fastball while actually traveling 10% slower. This is guaranteed to confuse the batter.\nKeep on practicing. Learn to alternate between a changeup and a fastball so the batter doesn't know what's coming.\nKeep the same arm speed and arm slot as you would for a fast ball. If your arm speed is slower, then the batter will know that your pitching speed will be slower too. The whole trick is in the illusion that you'll be throwing the ball at the same speed as a fastball.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119030}
{"text":" The most important thing about the grip is that either your index finger or middle finger is pushed up against the inside of a seam. (That's the left side of the seam for a righty, right side for a lefty). You can rest your ring finger and\/or pinky finger on the side of the ball if it makes it more comfortable.;\n, When you throw, DO NOT snap your wrist like you would a normal curve ball. Instead, come through like a normal fastball. Thrown correctly, the ball should be coming off your index finger. You might get some break diagonally down and away from a right hand batter (down and in if you throw lefty). More likely though, on your first try you didn't get much, if any, break. Just keep throwing like this to get used to the grip. Proceed to step 3 when you feel you have control.\n\n, After throwing a few times like a fastball, it's time to start making adjustments. At this point, your \"directional slurve\" probably isn't really breaking. An easy way to add a little more break is to push down with your middle finger on the outside of the ball. Doing so will add more rotation, and therefore more break. If you're having trouble, check the tips section below.\n\n, By this point, hopefully you've worked out any major problems to get a decent pitch working. But what about that \"directional\" part? When I throw this pitch without thinking, it has a diagonal break down and away from a righty. But the angle at which it breaks can be altered. For this next part, grip the ball and just imitate throwing. Imitate a throw holding the ball straight out in front of you. Now with the ball out in front of you, turn your hand SLIGHTLY down and to the left (down and right for a lefty). Throwing like this will put more of a downward movement and less across. Get used to this and then go back to the normal grip. Now try tilting your hand slightly back and to the right (left for lefties). This should break less down and more to the side. Get used to these two other angles and try throwing them. Again see tips if you're having trouble.\n\n, If you've made it this far, you can (hopefully) throw the \"directional slurve\" pretty well. You might even be able to direct the break based on the angle you hold it. So now you're on the mound and you're not sure how to use it. Throw it low in the zone and the batter should start his swing. It should drop out near the end and fall into the dirt. By then it's too late for the batter to stop his swing. Swing and a miss!... we hope. If you direct it to have more of a side to side break, you can throw it \"at the guy\" and let it break into the zone. This is only worth trying if it's unexpected, though. If it's expected, the batter can watch it in and pull it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119031}

Maintain this \u2018V\u2019 shape as you reach for the bat., As you grip the handle, keep your two \u2018V\u2019s facing downward (towards the bat handle), so that the inflection point of the \u2018V\u2019s (where the base of your thumb and forefinger meet) on both hands is in line with the spine along the backside of the bat blade.If you tilt your hands slightly so that the \u2018V\u2019s formed by your thumbs and forefingers are aligned with the part of the bat that lies between the spine and edge of the bat, this will give you more power when cutting or pulling the ball, and by changing the angle of the bat face, help to keep the ball on the ground.Both the cut and pull are cross-bat shots utilizing a horizontal swing to hit the ball on a trajectory perpendicular to the direction of the bowl. The cut shot uses a shorter swing to hit the ball in the direction the batter is facing (the off side).The pull uses a longer swing to hit the ball to the part of the field behind him as he faces the batter (the leg side)., Your dominant (top) hand should be closer to the top of the handle, and your other (bottom) hand should be closer to the bat blade.Putting your hands in the middle of handle gives the best combination of power and control.A high grip (hands towards the end of the handle) will generate more power. This is good for playing vertical shots (when the bat is swung upward at the ball on a vertical plane) that drive the ball.A low grip, or \u201cchoking\u201d the bat (hands towards the blade of the bat) will give you more control.This is good for horizontal or cross-bat shots (when the bat is swung horizontally, as in baseball).,\n\nThe closer you place your hands, the more power and less control you have. Moving them further apart will give you more control at the expense of power., Imagine you were holding a baby chick with your bottom hand; that is the amount of pressure to apply. You want your grip to be loose so that during your backswing, the bottom three fingers can come away from the bat, which is guided by only the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand. This allows for a fuller swing., This grip allows you to hit cross-batted shots, while also keeping the face of the bat square to the ball when hitting vertical shots, thus minimizing the danger of edging the ball.\n\n\nEdging is when the ball is struck with the edge of the bat instead of the face. These glancing shots are often caught for an out by the wicket keeper or the slips \u2013 fielders who are positioned behind the batter.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119032}
{"text":" It's important that you gain a sense for the kind of balls the pitcher is throwing. Note any patterns you recognize, including the pitches he favors and your assessment of his curveball. If most of his curves come across the plate as hanging curveballs, you should be prepared to take advantage of this.\n\n\nA hanging curveball is an off speed pitch in your strike zone. With proper preparation, hanging curveballs are ripe for a punishing hit.\nAnalyze the pitcher's habits to see if there are any early warning signs for certain pitches, like a twitch of his glove before going into the windup.;\n, Some pitchers, especially those with more experience, are better at hiding their tells than others. But a \"tell\" is where you indicate what is going to happen through body language before you do it. These might include:\n\n\nA change in windup.\nA twitch of the glove.\nSearching for the seams of the ball for proper curveball finger placement.\n\n, The backspin a pitcher puts on a curveball causes pressure to increase in the air in front of and under the ball, causing it to \"ride\" on this higher pressure air. Curveballs with topspin creates high pressure on top of the ball, deflecting the ball downward.If you are able to identify a curveball from the outset, knowing to prepare yourself for a dropping or floating ball will give you the advantage when trying to hit it.\nA downward breaking ball is often referred to as a \"12-6 curve\" due to the fact that the ball is on a straight appearing path down, like the movement from 12 to 6 on the hands of a clock.\n\n, If the pitcher is a right-hander the ball will break away from righty batters and into lefty batters; the opposite is true for left-handed pitcher. Submarine pitches that attempt a curveball will likely sink into the dirt.\n\n, Batters who are out front, unaware, and\/or are imbalanced at the time a curveball is thrown will likely have problems hitting it.Think about times you have tried to hit curves in the past and your stance leading up to the hit. Your stance is not ideal for a breaking ball if:\n\n\nYou are pushing forward, out front, or are overextending your knee so that its over or in front of your foot.\nYou are persistently swinging at balls that are curving outside the strike zone due to over-committal and premature weight transfer.\n\n, If you know you are up against a curveball master, you might have difficulty hitting even his worst breaking ball. But foreknowledge and mentally preparing yourself to face a difficult pitch will keep your focus sharp and your batting average up.\n\n\nWatch the path of the pitcher's curveballs and visualize the trajectory of the ball as you would see it from the plate. Think of how you might hit the ball and the ideal place for you to begin your swing.\n\n, If you notice that the other team's pitcher has been having an off day with his curveballs, you may be in luck. Poor daily performance or the high pressure of an important game can negatively impact a pitchers ability to throw a good curve consistently.\n\n\nA pitcher having a bad breaking ball day will be more hesitant to make use of the tricky physics of this pitch.\n\n, Stance is an important factor for hitting any ball that crosses the plate. Keep your weight on the balls of your feet and your knees slightly bent with your back leg holding more of your weight than your front. Foot placement depends largely on your body type, but some who are knowledgeable in baseball recommend that your feet be set a bit wider than shoulder width.Stand at a right angle to the plate and hold your bat off your shoulder and at the top of your strike zone.\n\n\nKeep an eye on your feet; many players have difficulty regulating their stance. To get the best hit, you'll need to make sure your feet aren't too narrowly or widely placed.\nWhile you wait for the pitcher to begin his pitch, you should be relaxed and keep your feet still as you await the release of the ball., Seeing that a pitcher is using a curveball from the very release will improve your odds of hitting it greatly. The hand position for a classic curve ball orients the seams in the direction of the pitchers fingers, with the tops of his middle finger touching the inside of a seam of the baseball. This will create a U-shape position in the hand of the pitcher., The spin of a curve ball will have a visual effect on it as it approaches you. If you notice an approximately one inch circle or a solid dot where you would normally see the blur of the red stitching, you have a curve ball incoming., Since the most common kind of curve ball sinks as it approaches the plate, pushing forward and being out front will drastically hurt your odds of hitting it. Not only will keeping your body and weight back, you'll increase power and give yourself some additional slivers of a second to react to and crush the curve., Most people who have difficulty with curve balls commit too early with their swing and waste a strike on a ball that was outside their zone. Most knee-high balls will break down out of your strike zone and should be avoided. High curves, however, frequently break into the strike zone., Since a classic 12-6 curve sinks on the approach, rising to meet this ball with your bat is not advised.If the angle of your swing is not spot on, you'll miss the ball or get poor contact.\n\n\nMany experts argue that this is the most critical part of hitting a breaking ball. If you know the kind of break the pitcher will be using, allow the ball to sink into your swing., A little hesitation can be a good thing when the pitcher is throwing an off-speed pitch. You may feel a kind of tension or hesitation once your stride foot comes down. During this critical moment, you should keep your hands and the majority of your weight (about 70%) back, so that in the event the ball is a hittable curve, you are prepared., Have a practice partner stand behind a screen about 15 ft in front of the plate. Your practice partner should alternate between overhand and underhand techniques, giving an irregular tempo to the pitches coming across the plate. Your goal is to drive all of these right up middle field.The variability of these pitches will help you recognize off-speed pitches and the shifts in posture and body position that accompany off-speed pitches.\n\n, Your practice partner should stand on your open side at about 45\u00b0 behind your batting position. Have your partner lob an underhand toss into the contact zone while you concentrate on crushing the ball straight into the midfield.The angle of approach for this drill is ideal for giving you the impression that you are on the inside, which is the right habit to have when trying to hit a breaking ball.\n\n, It can be difficult allowing curves to drop and come to you. To practice patience and keep yourself from pushing forward and being out front, have a practice partner set up a screen 10 - 15 ft in front of you. Then have him lob the ball to you over the screen.Wait for the ball to enter your optimal hitting zone.\nStay inside the ball.\nAttempt to rocket the ball straight up the middle.\n\n, The more you practice the curveball, the easier it will be for you to notice and manage. You might consider spending one-on-one time with your pitcher to train hitting his curves or even drilling the curveballs from a pitching machine.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119033}
{"text":" If you are right-handed, stand in the box on the left side of home plate when facing the pitcher, so that you are on the third-base side of home plate. If you are left-handed, opt for the right, on the first-base side.Face home plate. Touch the far side of home plate with the end of your bat. Back up until your arm is fully extended.Feel free to experiment with standing on each side of the box. Some right-handed hitters prefer standing on the right side of home plate, and vice versa with left-handed hitters.\nDon\u2019t stand too close or too far from the plate. Standing too far away will make it much more difficult to hit outside pitches.Crowding the plate will do the same with inside pitches.\nIf you are a beginner, start by standing directly across from the plate. After a lot of practice in this position, experiment with moving up toward the front of the box or further back, which may make it easier to hit certain pitches. Hitting from the rear of the box, for example, will provide extra time for you to hit a fastball.;\n, Place any object (a batting tee, a fellow player, etc.) roughly 20 feet away from you (6 meters). Stick your arm straight out in front of you. With both eyes open, raise your thumb into a thumbs-up so that it blocks the object from view. Shut one eye. If your view remains the same, open that eye and shut the other. Whichever eye is suddenly able to see the object is your dominant eye.\/images\/thumb\/6\/67\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/6\/67\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-2-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-handed people often have a dominant right eye. Left-handed people typically have a dominant left eye.\nDetermining which eye is dominant will help you choose the best stance to adopt at the plate.\n\n, Pick between the neutral, open, and closed stances. Base your decision partly on whichever one makes it easier to keep your dominant eye on the ball. Also consider how the placement of your feet in each position affects your swing.Regardless of which one you choose, bend your knees a little. Point your toes toward the plate with your feet spread to shoulder-width or a few inches wider.Neutral stance (also called \"even stance\"): Both feet are placed an equal distance from home plate. This is the most popular stance, since it allows you to turn your head over your shoulder without any strain so you can face the pitcher and keep both eyes on the ball.\n\nOpen stance: The foot closest to the pitcher is moved slightly back so that the front of your body is a little more \u201copen\u201d to the pitcher. This is the least popular stance because it takes you out of hitting position, thus creating extra steps to get back into position during the pitch.\n\nClosed stance: The foot closest to the pitcher is placed a tiny bit forward. This stance allows you to cover more of the plate with your bat. However, turning your head to keep both eyes on the pitcher may be more of a strain.\nIf pointing your forward foot toward home plate proves to be uncomfortable, try adjusting it so that your toes point 45 degrees more toward the pitcher.\n\n, Cradle the grip in the middle of your fingers instead of your palms. If you are right-handed, grip the bat with your left fingers an inch or two above the very bottom. Then place your right fingers above your left.Extend your arms in front of you as if you just took a swing. Make sure the palm of your left hand is facing downward and the palm of your right is facing up.If you are left-handed, do the reverse.\n\n\nKeep a secure grip on the bat, but also keep your grip loose enough so that your muscles are relaxed.Adjust your grip so that the second knuckles of both hands form a perfect line.\n\n, Keep your shoulders in a straight line pointed toward the pitcher.Bend both elbows. Draw your rear elbow up and back until it is level with your rear shoulder and pointing directly behind you. Keep both elbows roughly six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) away from you. Angle the bat 45 degrees over your rear shoulder.\/images\/thumb\/4\/4d\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/4d\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-5-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResting the bat on your shoulder or holding it horizontally will weaken your swing.Holding the bat vertically can create a more powerful swing, but may be uncomfortable for beginners.\n\n, Turn your head toward the pitcher over your front shoulder. Keep your head still and straight, without cocking it to one side. Focus with both eyes on the ball from the moment it leaves the pitcher\u2019s hand to the instant you make contact with the bat.Practice how to swing a baseball bat as much as you can before going to bat in a game. Train until the swing comes naturally, without you having to think about every little step. This way you are better equipped to concentrate on the ball with your full attention, instead of also having to plot out what to do next.\n\n, Imagine that you are the hammer to a pistol aimed at the pitcher. Now imagine that you are being cocked to fire as the ball approaches. Move your body\u2019s weight to your rear leg until your rear knee and shoulder are aligned (this is the \u201cload\u201d). Now raise your front foot and take a short step toward the pitcher (this is the \u201cstride\u201d).\/images\/thumb\/4\/4f\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/4f\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-7-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your stride short so that your body\u2019s weight can shift more easily from your rear leg to your front leg once you begin to swing., Plant your front foot in place and keep it there throughout your swing. Bend your knee a little if keeping it straight proves to be uncomfortable. Use this leg to prevent yourself from spilling forward with the forward momentum created by your swing.\/images\/thumb\/f\/f5\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/f\/f5\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving your front foot during your swing will cause you to swing a slower bat.\nHaving an unstable front leg will also make it harder for you to keep your head still.\n\n, As you begin your swing, stand on your back toes. Let the weight of your body shift to your front leg, in the ball\u2019s direction, to add more power to your swing. Ensure that all of your swing\u2019s momentum is aimed directly at the ball.\/images\/thumb\/3\/31\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/31\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-9-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe position of your feet should ultimately form a triangle, with your head as its point. The sides between your head and each foot should be relatively equal. This gives you near perfect balance.\n\n, Use your whole body to swing the bat, not just your arms. As you begin your swing, lead with your rear hip and then follow through with your arms and hands.Keep your elbows bent and tucked in as close to your sides as you can.\/images\/thumb\/c\/c1\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c1\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-10-preview-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot on your back toes as you swing, so they end up pointing toward the pitcher.\nThe closer you keep the bat to your body, the more power you can deliver with your swing.\n\n, As you bring your bat down from its starting position, aim to keep it parallel to the ground. At the same time, bring it level to the ball\u2019s plane of trajectory.Time your movements so that you hit the ball at the precise moment when your rear hip and shoulder have swung forward to the point that your upper torso is now squarely facing the pitcher.\/images\/thumb\/3\/30\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/30\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-11-preview-Version-4.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAim to hit the ball with your bat\u2019s \u201csweet spot,\u201d roughly five to seven inches from the top of the bat.Keeping the bat parallel to the ground and level with the ball will better ensure that you still hit the ball even if you miss it with the bat\u2019s sweet spot.\n\n, Aim to hit the ball when your swing is at its most powerful. Ensure this by swinging \u201cthrough the ball\u201d (also called \u201cfollowing through\u201d). Instead of swinging the bat just far enough to make contact with the ball, wait until you have actually hit it before you quit adding force to your swing. Then let the bat slow down as it crosses in front your chest.Your swing should begin with your chin facing your front shoulder. Without moving your head, your chin should then face your rear shoulder by the end of your swing as you follow through.Think of a sprinter crossing a finish line. They don\u2019t slow down and come to a dead stop right at the finish line. They sprint at full speed straight through it. Only then do they slow down bit by bit until they finally stop well past the finish line.\n\n, Start by learning how to move fluidly from movement to movement while staying balanced throughout. Worry about hitting an actual ball later. For now, follow a four-count drill to learn how to move through your stance, load, stride, and swing effectively.Start with a slow count to better identify mistakes. As you master each step, speed up the count so it becomes more natural and fluid.\n\/images\/thumb\/a\/a9\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/a\/a9\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-13-preview.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, adopt your stance.\nOn the count of \u201cone,\u201d load up.\nOn \u201ctwo,\u201d take your stride forward.\nOn \u201cthree,\u201d train your eyes on the imaginary ball.\nOn \u201cfour,\u201d swing.\n\n, Remember that your swing should be led by your rear hip, not your arms or hands. Hold the bat incorrectly during some of your four-count drills in order to force all of your concentration onto your hips. Instead of using both hands to hold it by its grip, hold the bottom of the bat in one hand and its top in the other.\/images\/thumb\/d\/d0\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/d\/d0\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-14-preview.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of awkwardly drawing the bat up to shoulder-level, draw it behind your rear hip during your stance, load, and stride.\n\n, Before accepting pitches, train with a stationary tee. Learn how to hit a ball with maximum power before worrying about connecting with a ball in motion. Use this time to perfect your movements, as well as following through.Place the tee at different points across the plate to grow accustomed to hitting different pitches.\n\n, Once you are confident in your form, start hitting live balls. But instead of moving on directly to baseballs, start off with a ball that is less heavy. Try tennis balls, whiffle balls, or practice baseballs, since these travel at slower speeds due to their lightness.Train your eyes to follow these slower balls, which are easier to track.\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c5\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-16-preview.jpg\/v4-550px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-16-preview.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c5\/Hit-a-Baseball-Step-16-preview.jpg\/v4-300px-Hit-a-Baseball-Step-16-preview.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there, advance to actual baseballs, either thrown by a live pitcher or a pitching machine.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119034}
{"text":" Make sure you have most of your weight on your back foot, \u00a0As the pitch comes in, get ready to hit by \"loading up\", or stepping with your front foot (left foot if you're a right-handed batter, right foot if you're a left-handed batter) straight towards the pitching mound. A common mistake hitters will make is that they will \"step out\", or step behind them. This leads to either totally missing the ball or barely making contact.;\n, The pitch is now coming towards the plate - time to make a decision. The strike zone is the length of the front of home plate and from the batter's shoulders to his or her knees. If the ball seems like it won't pass through that area, take the pitch; even if it ends up a strike, you have two more strikes before you're called out.\n\n\nIf the ball is probably going to be a strike, follow it with your eyes and turn your head to see it fully as it comes closer to home plate, not taking your eyes off of it.\n\n, With your bat, practice going diagonally to the ball until you have it perfect.\n\n, That would be great, except you haven't hit the ball yet. It is imperative that you make a conscious effort as you go to hit the ball that you keep your head looking at the ball. Bringing your head out results in foul tips\/swings and misses.\n\n, As you swing, make sure to continue just as fast as you were going when you went to hit the ball even after you have felt contact. Keep your hands steady and level the whole way through, and end with them above your front shoulder.

{"text":" \"Showing bunt\" means stepping into the batter's box and immediately getting into bunting position, with two hands on the bat. You show bunt when everyone knows you're going to bunt \u2014 if you're a pitcher for example. You may not want to show bunt if you want to lay down a surprise bunt.\n\n\nAs soon as you show bunt, the third and first basemen on the other team should begin to move in towards the batter's box to field the bunt. If you're trying to surprise them and increase your chances of laying down a successful bunt, you probably don't want to show bunt until the pitcher starts his motion.;\n, Leave your bottom hand in the same spot as when you usually hit. Slowly slide your top hand to where the bat begins to thicken into the barrel. The barrel of the bat should be tilted upwards slightly so it's at a 30\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 angle from the ground. The barrel should rest above the hands at all times.\n\n\nIf clutching onto the barrel of the bat, be sure to keep your thumb and index finger firmly behind the barrel. You don't want any fingers sticking out, and you certainly don't want the front of the bat \u2014 the part that's closest to the pitcher \u2014 being blocked by overeager fingers.\n\n, You don't want both feet to form a straight line with the plate, as this will leave you very exposed, and won't let you explode out of the batter's box if you happen to lay down the bunt. Instead, turn your back foot towards the pitcher and square off your upper body towards the pitch.If the pitch comes inside, you can quickly turn your body back to avoid being hit.\n\n, In a suicide squeeze situation, you want to bunt any pitch you can make contact with. Otherwise, you only want to bunt strikes. If the pitch is down low, up high, or way outside or inside, simply pull the bat back to indicate to the ump that you're taking the ball, not trying to bunt. If you just keep your bat over the plate, the ump is likely to call a strike.\n\n, Where you place your bunt has a huge impact on whether you beat out the throw. If you want to place your bunt on the third base side, angle your bat so that it squares off with the third baseman. If you want to place your bunt on the first base side, angle your bat so that it squares off with the first baseman.\n\n\nTake a look at the infield before you get in the batter's box. If the third baseman, for example, is playing close to the grass or is shaded closer to the shortstop than he should be, you probably want to aim your bunt as close to the third baseline as possible.\nThere's no consensus about where the best place is to place your bunt. Some say that bunting it between the pitcher and the third baseman is ideal, as they might get confused about who's going to field it. Others think that bunting towards the second baseman forces the second baseman to make a really tough throw, across his body.\nIf there's a runner on first base, try to bunt towards the second baseman. If there's a runner on second base, try to bunt in between the third baseman and the shortstop., Dropping your bat to bunt a low pitch is very difficult and requires amazing hand-eye coordination. Bending your knees is relatively easy \u2014 anyone can do it.\n\n, As the pitch comes, look the ball into the bat. You want your eyes focused on the ball as much as possible.\n\n, If you leave your bat rigid when it makes contact with the ball, the ball is more likely to bounce off of it harder, tumbling easily into the mitt of the pitcher, third-, or first baseman. If you pull your bat back slightly right before making contact, the ball should travel just the right amount \u2014 equal distance from the catcher, pitcher, and any infielder. This helps you achieve the perfect bunt.\n\n, If you hit the ball on the bottom half of the barrel, the ball will travel down onto the ground, where it will need to be fielded. If you hit the ball on the top half of the barrel, it will travel up into the air, where it can easily be caught.\n\n, If you foul a ball off while bunting with two strikes, you're out. Many batters transition to their hitting stance with two strikes and try to hit. Take cues from the third base coach about whether or not you should try bunting with two strikes.\n\n, If you're a left-handed batter, you can \"pull\" the bat with you towards first base before you've made contact. (This is called a \"pull\" or \"drag\" bunt and it's hard to do!)\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119036}
{"text":" Throwing gently will warm up your throwing arm, and throwing too fast too quickly greatly increases the risk of injury. Always warm up for 5-10 minutes of light catch, easy throwing and gentle stretching before trying to throw fast or lift weights.\n\n\nWarming up loosens your muscles, and this flexibility is key to unlocking your most powerful possible throws.;\n, Many people have heard that \"your power comes from your legs,\" and while this is partially true, it doesn't tell the whole story, Your legs generate a lot of power, but it only helps your throw if you can transmit that power through the bottom up. Accordingly, powerful throwers know that they must focus on their entire body to throw well. For a righty, it looks like:\n\n\nPlant your left foot in front of your body.\nPoint your shoulders in line with the target\nBring the ball behind you.\nPush off the back foot as you start to throw\nRotate your hips and shoulders towards the target.\nRelease as the ball passes your head.\nFollow through with your shoulders and back foot as you release the ball.\n\n, The basics of throwing are likely obvious, as outlined above.. But the little things, when you get the right, will add up to something much more powerful. The natural starting point is your stance. The stance is very similar to a tennis player getting ready to serve, or a basketball player guarding someone. To get maximum power, make sure your:\n\n\nHands are in the middle of your body, ready to move.\nKnees are slightly bent as if you're ready to spring into action.\nFeet are light so that you are balancing near the balls of your feet.\nSpine and back are straight., This is for right-handed throwers. If you're a pitcher, this is your step off the mound, but all fielders do this for longer or more powerful throws. As your knee comes up, your throwing arm remains bent at the elbow and the ball near your chest. As your leg kicks forward, you start bringing your arm back.\n\n\nAs you land your foot, you want your arm moving forward. Your goal, as you read the next few steps, is for you arm to be cocked right behind your head, elbow at 90 degrees, as this front foot lands stiff not flexed.\nStudies show that the stride is more important for power than the actual throwing motion.This is equally true for an outfielder running up to make a big throw to the infield., This is where you really start getting power. As you are stepping forward with that front foot, your back foot is pushing you forward. As the ball is coming towards your head, your hips are turning towards your target at the same time your throwing arm is rotating your body around., Timing this up is key for powerful throws. As you land on the foot, your elbow should be cocked behind you. It is at 90 degrees, with the ball above your head. Practice getting into this position right as your foot lands.\n\n, As your arm comes over your head and you release the ball, let your back leg and throwing arm keep moving. Because you've been rotating, they'll both come across your body after you let the ball go.\n\n, This puts back spin on the ball, stabilizing it as it flies through the air. Your fingers will pull down on the laces so that the ball spins back towards you as it flies. As the ball leaves your hand, snap your wrist and fingers down.If you haven't already started, make sure you're gripping the ball over the laces. Every time you catch the ball, focus on finding the laces quickly before throwing it back., Ultimately, strength has very little to do with throwing speed. Mechanics are far more important. But most people consciously try to throw fast: they jerk their arms, increase the speed, and mechanics suffer. Loose arms and a relaxed body transmits energy far more effectively.\n\n\nImagine your body as a slingshot. A rigid, taut sling would be very difficult to shoot effectively, but a loose, flexible band is quicker to release, prep, and fire., When you push off the ground, you put your body in motion. It is almost like a waterfall -- the power of the water doesn't come from the top of the waterfall, but from the entire distance the water falls. Similarly, the power starts in your feet, but you must rotate your whole body, specifically the hips and torso, to transmit that power into your throwing motion. Focus on the tips above, then do the following to help improve your throws:\n\n\nVideotape your throwing motion. At what points do you look jerky or weak?\nCheck your follow through. Your body should naturally follow the pitch, spinning you slightly so that your back leg comes around the front of your planted leg.\nKeep your muscles loose. If you feel like you're trying to hard, you are. It won't help.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119037}
{"text":" You won't be able to drive a ball over the batter's eye in center field just be reading articles online at home. You'll need to get into the gym and work on building up and reinforcing the most important key to your swing - your body. While a massive chest, broad shoulders, and bulging biceps look impressive, a powerful swing actually requires other muscles., While the swinging seems to be done by your upper body, your upper body is mostly a vehicle for delivering the power that your legs generate. Work on improving lower body strength. Powerful, multi-joint moves like squats, lunges, and cleans are a great way to build up functional lower body strength., Abs, obliques, and your lower back muscles are necessary for stabilizing your upper body and delivering the power generated by your legs through contact with the ball. A weak core will compromise the kinetic chain from your lower body to the head of the bat.\n\n, While biceps may look good at the beach, they do little for your baseball swing. Strong wrists and a strong grip, on the other hand, add both stability and bat speed to your swing. Don't neglect them. , There is a reason why athletes from all-star baseball sluggers to NFL running backs and receivers take yoga and dance classes to give them an edge in their sports. You should do the same.\n\n\nFocusing on flexibility through exercises like yoga, which builds core strength and stability as well as increases range of motion. By making your body more flexible you'll boost your reaction time and bat speed in addition to keeping your kinetic chain fluid and powerful.\n\n, While the effects of learning to relax are physical, the process is mental. Some athletes use meditation or yoga to relax, some repeat reassuring phrases or mantras. Sluggers and hitting coaches know that trying to hit a home run with every swing is a sure-fire way to start a hitting slump.\n\n\nFind what your mind needs in order to help yourself relax and stay focused.\nRelaxation will both eliminate distractions from your mind and allow your body to be calm, loose, and powerful through your swing, which allows your bat to whip through the strike zone with increased speed. , While you are trying to generate power, you must keep your balance through your swing. Smoothly transferring your weight forward while generating power from your legs will allow for maximum torque upon impact with the ball. The more torque you generate, the more energy will be transferred to the ball.\n\n, Whether you are dealing with an inside swing or an outside swing, it is important to keep your hands close to your body. Most of your swing is generated in your hands and wrists. If your hands are extended your bat speed will slow and your power will drop. The palm of your dominant (top) hand should remain facing upwards through contact in order to drive through the ball.\n\n, Don't over-swing, or try to put any extra power into it. Most of the power in a swing is generated through your hips and wrists. Allow that power to flow through your body smoothly. Trying to swing extra hard will harm rather than help you.\n\n\nTrying to \"muscle\" through the ball will usually result in your body tightening up, which compromises your natural kinetic chain and prevents your wrists from snapping into your swing as quickly.\nLight muscles are fast muscles. Tight muscles are slow muscles. , Properly following through is important for multiple reasons. Not only will it help you to add all-important distance generating backspin to the ball, but it will help point out any flaws in your swing.In most cases, you want your hands to finish high which ensures that the bat head stays through the hitting zone as long as possible.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119038}
{"text":" When stealing, many things should go through your mind. \"How good is the catcher's arm? Does the pitcher have a good move to first? Who covers second? What does the pitcher do before he throws? Does the situation require a steal?\" This and more is equally important in stealing.;\n, This is important. Normally, the lead-off is your body length and a step. This makes it easier to dive back in. But, if you're slower, be conservative; only about a body length is necessary. If you're fast, take more, but be reasonable.\n\n, That's about two or three steps. A good secondary is what gets you in to second. When the pitch is thrown, you take the secondary lead.\n\n, Look only at the base and listen to the base coach, either to slide, stand up, keep on running.\n\n, Because the ball is still live and they can tag you out if you step off, this can assist you. To call time effectively, yell time and throw your hands up, or make a \"T\" with your hands.\n\n,, This time its about two body lengths and a step. Again, take as much as you think you need to to be able to dive back in and steal third. The secondary lead is much more important here, because the base is closer to the catcher than second was.\n\n, When sliding into third, always go to the right of the bag. The extra couple of inches can lead to a difference of out and safe.\n\n, This is extremely important. Many players have stolen successfully, yet been tagged out after.\n\n, The things you need to consider should be: \"Is the catcher a good blocker?\" \"Is he fast to get the ball?\" Is the pitcher fast?\" \"Can he get to home in time for the tag?\"\n\n, If not, take a little more.\n\n, When running home, slide to the opposite part of the bag where the catcher is. Namely, if he\/she is on the right part of the backstop, slide to the right, and vice versa. You also can run through home, but when in doubt, slide.\n\n,, If it's wet, you'll have to slide closer. If dry, slide farther away. Sliding to closer can result in broken bones or twisted ankles. Sliding to far can result in being cleated and\/or outs.\n\n, If they are in front of you and you can't move away, then try to hit them as lightly as possible. That doesn't mean slow down, but do not lower your shoulder. Common sense right there.\n\n, If you're the batter, run as fast as you can out of the box. If you're the runner, unless uncatchable or with two outs, wait until the ball is either caught or hits the ground. Note: This is on\u00a0a fly ball.\n\n, When rounding a base, fish-hook out about three feet. To do a fish-tail, start running out a little bit off the baseline, until you're about three feet off the line. This is legal. When near the bag, start turning in so you can touch the very inside bottom corner of the bag. Pushing off the bag helps with extra speed.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119039}

{"text":" There are variations to side arm pitching, so watch carefully at the angle he releases the ball. Watch how fast he throws so you can time it right. Side-armers tend to throw a lot of curves and sliders, so watch for those as well.;\n, If you have a right handed pitcher and a right handed batter, from the batter's perspective, it will look like the ball is heading right for you after the release. It will then move over the plate and typically land just outside the strike zone. For a righty-lefty match-up, it will look like the ball is very far outside just after he releases it. It will move in towards you at the end. Lefty versus lefty basically is the same as a righty-righty match-up, explained above. Hitting against a pitcher with the same dominant hand is harder because the ball looks as if it will hit you.\n\n, Almost every side arm pitch looks as if it will hit you at one time or another, but if one really looks like it will hit you, turn around and stand your ground, letting the pitch hit your back. This will not hurt as much, if it hurts at all, as getting hit by an overhand pitcher because side arm pitchers do not throw as fast.\n\n, Side arm pitchers are deceptive, yet usually very, very, accurate. Chances are the second pitch will be thrown to the exact same spot as the first. Now you want to swing at the third pitch, especially if the first two were strikes.

{"text":" At a young age, a changeup is the best choice. A changeup is thrown like a palm ball, with all five fingers on the baseball. Do the same windup as your fastball, and whip the ball in there at about 80% velocity. The ball will be slower because of your grip (tighter = slower), but make sure your windup looks like you are throwing a fastball.;\n, Do not aim for the heart of the plate, then you are just asking to get rocked. Practice throwing on the inside or outside corner, the sides of home plate. Check the \"Tips\" section below for more important information about locating your pitches.\n\n, Don't throw your off speed pitch whenever there are two strikes, because the batter will see it coming. Try it on the first pitch sometimes, or the second pitch, even throw two in a row if you think the batter isn't expecting it.\n\n, This is a pitch that is thrown out of the strike zone, in hope that the batter will swing and miss. If you are going to do this, you could try the \"high heat\" which is your fastball down the middle, but just below the shoulders. Or another option is knee high and about three inches outside. Those are the two most tempting purpose pitches.\n\n,, If your mechanics are right, then it must be your arm. If you recently pitched (3 days or less) or just threw a lot, then you may want to consider sitting the game out.

{"text":" You\u2019ll sometimes hear professional ballplayers talk about pitching through a case of \u201cdead arm,\u201d which is vaguely defined as a general weakness that impacts pitching velocity and accuracy. However, big league pitchers know better than to risk their arm health (and earning potential) by throwing with a sore or painful arm, and ballplayers at every level should follow that same advice.Muscle soreness is your body\u2019s way of indicating overuse, and may be caused by micro-tearing of the muscle tissues. Continuing to throw when soreness or pain is present is the greatest risk factor for experiencing a significant arm injury.When your arm starts to feel sore, stop throwing and rest. It will only become more sore otherwise, and will be at ever-greater risk for injury.\nThere is no \"magic number\" for the amount of rest needed. As one example of a general guideline, though, Little League Baseball requires rest periods of one to four days based on the pitcher's age (7-17) and the number of pitches thrown in an outing.;\n, There is no \u201cmagic number\u201d of pitches, innings, or rest time that guarantees prevention of arm soreness or injury. That said, increased awareness has led to common-sense (or even rule-defined) limits being established in youth leagues right up to the pro leagues. Know the limits for your league\/level, and follow them.Recommendations and restrictions can vary, but some experts say that youth pitchers (age 9-14) should never throw more than 75 pitches in a game (or 90 if age 15-18); should not throw more than 600 pitches (age 9-14) or 100 innings (age 15-18) per year; and should not pitch in more than two games per week.You\u2019ll have to personally keep track of pitches, innings, and rest between outings if you or your child is playing in multiple leagues (such as a high school team and a travel team) at once. Generally speaking, it is best for kids to avoid pitching on multiple teams in overlapping seasons anyway.\n\n, One reason that pitch counts and innings limits can only be recommendations is that not all pitches and innings are created equal. A long, high-intensity inning ratchets up the levels of stress, intensity, and fatigue, making soreness and injury more likely. That is to say that three easy ten-pitch innings are less fatiguing than one stressful thirty-pitch inning.Watch closely for signs of a pitcher wearing down during a long or high-intensity inning. A breakdown in pitching mechanics is often a clear indicator of fatigue. A fastball that becomes consistently elevated in the strike zone usually indicates a breakdown in mechanics and fatigue.\nNot surprisingly, increased pitching velocity increases the chance for soreness and injury. Keep an especially close eye for signs of fatigue if a youth pitcher is throwing in a championship or other important game, in a \u201cshowcase\u201d for college recruiters or pro scouts, or when a radar gun is being used to track velocity. The desire to dig deep for a little extra \u201coomph\u201d on the fastball can lead to arm troubles.\n\n, Traditionally, baseball has been a seasonal pursuit from late spring into early fall, leaving the rest of the year for other sports like football, basketball, or soccer. In the quest for college scholarships and multi-million dollar pro contracts, however, many youth pitchers have begun playing baseball year-round in multiple overlapping leagues. Such efforts, however, are probably doing more harm than good.Many experts recommend that youth pitchers should take off at least four months per year, with at least two or three of those taken consecutively. Extended periods of absolute rest from the arm motion of throwing a baseball are vital to muscle healing and development, especially for the growing bodies of young athletes.\n\n, If you look at successful \u201cpower pitchers\u201d with exceptional fastballs in the big leagues, you\u2019ll notice that most of them have thick, muscular legs that they use to propel their bodies toward home plate. Leg and core muscles are stronger and more durable than shoulder and arm muscles, and all of these muscle groups should be developed and used in concert to get the best (and most arm-friendly) results out of pitching.Consult with experienced sports trainers, physical therapists, sports medicine doctors, or pitching coaches to develop a \u201cglobal strengthening program\u201d to increase muscle stability and strength in these key areas. For instance, the \u201cThrower\u2019s Ten Program\u201d uses resistance bands, dumbbells, and an exercise ball in a simple ten-step regimen intended to strengthen a pitcher\u2019s shoulder, core, and leg muscles.Strength programs like the \u201cThrower\u2019s Ten\u201d are intended for use during baseball season (in this case, three or four times per week), but should not be used shortly before or after a pitching performance. Be sure to allow time for muscle rest and recovery.\n\n, Stronger leg and core muscles cannot help reduce the burden on the arm unless an effective, repeatable pitching motion is utilized. You want to be able to propel your whole body forward into the pitch instead of using your arm in a whipping motion. You also want to be comfortable with the motion and be able to repeat it consistently even as you begin to tire during an outing.There is no single pitching motion that works for everyone, but studying the mechanics of effective professional pitchers is a good starting point for developing your own motion. Use video to study others\u2019 motions and your own. Rely on the advice of reputable pitching guides and coaches, but also listen to your body. If a pitching motion is painful or uncomfortable, it isn\u2019t right for you.\nNew technologies are being developed all the time to help in establishing and maintaining safer and more effective pitching motions. For instance, there are now arm sleeves that can track arm motion and record arm angle, elbow torque, and other key data., A good pitching motion utilizes major muscle groups throughout the body, so time should be taken to loosen and warm up more than just your arm before taking the pitching mound. That said, warming up your arm properly is essential to warding off soreness and injury.Start with dynamic stretching, such as doing jumping jacks or jogging for three to five minutes, to get your blood flowing and loosen up your muscles.\nMove on to static stretching, gently stretching all your major muscle groups from head to toe and holding each stretch for about thirty seconds.\nFinally, begin throwing the baseball, starting with \u201csoft toss\u201d (easy throws at a short distance). Slowly increase the distance and velocity, and eventually move on to throwing some warm up pitches that approximate the intensity and conditions of throwing on the mound.\n\n, As mentioned elsewhere in this article, youth baseball leagues in particular are increasingly establishing required rest periods after a pitching performance (often based on the number of pitches or innings thrown). Always follow these rest protocols, but also follow common sense and listen to your body. If your arm is tired or sore, rest it until it feels better.Icing down a pitcher\u2019s arm at the conclusion of an outing has been standard practice for decades in pro baseball, and icing does help to reduce the inflammation that can occur due to possible micro-tearing of muscle tissues. Apply ice to the shoulder and upper arm immediately after finishing a pitching outing, and then occasionally as needed thereafter.\nAnti-inflammatory pain relievers can help relieve soreness, but don\u2019t try to use medications to mask arm pain in order to pitch again. This is a recipe for a potentially serious arm injury.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119043}

{"text":" Earned run average is the number of times a man from the opposing scores a run due to the fault of the pitcher. This could be because of three things:\n\n\nThe batter made a hit. Although it does mean the pitcher threw a strike, it counts against his earned run average.\nThe pitcher walked the batter. This could be the result of the pitcher throwing four balls or hitting the batter with the pitch.;\n, To calculate an accurate ERA, you must have accurate numbers. You need to know the earned runs, but to do this you have to look at when the pitcher was pulled from a game. For example, if a pitcher played three innings and in the fourth inning allowed a man on every base and then was pulled, all three of those men would count against his ERA. They do not transfer to the next pitcher simply because he was the one pitching when they made it across home plate.\n\n, Whereas earned runs are caused by hits and are the fault of the pitcher, unearned runs are usually caused by errors or passed balls and are not strictly the fault of the pitcher. Unearned runs do not count towards a pitcher's ERA.\n\n\nFor example, there are runners on 2nd and 3rd base, with 2 outs. The pitcher throws a pitch to the batter, which ends up being a routine ground ball to the first baseman, but the first baseman bobbles it and can't make a play to get an out. One runner scores, and two are still left on base. The run is unearned, and if the two remaining runners on base happen to score, their runs also count as unearned.\n\n, To calculate ERA, you need three parts: the earned runs, the innings pitched, and the total number of innings.\n\n\nEarned runs, as explained above, are the number of times a pitcher lets a batter get on base. This is the total number for the whole game.\nThe innings pitched is just like it sounds, the total number of innings this pitcher pitched. This number will always end in thirds. That is because for every inning three strikes can be made by the fielding team. That leaves three possible outcomes: a whole inning (three outs), an inning with two outs (ends in .66), or an inning with one out (ends in .33).\nThe total number of innings refers to the number of innings in a complete game (9).","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119047}

Accuracy and velocity should follow if you are performing the right drills.\n\n, If your mechanics need work, keep doing drills. Eventually, your muscles will remember the drills and in a week or two, it will become feeling natural.\n\n, If you work hard enough, you should be able to throw 60-70 bullpen pitches, 2-3 times a week. ALWAYS ice your arm after throwing. The ice will help soothe any pain and it will repair your arm. Do not over-exert yourself while throwing. Stay comfortable and relaxed; being tight during throwing can increase the chances of injury.\n\n, On the days you are not throwing, you could run or bike. During the winter, you can use a treadmill if you have one. Your week should consist of 2-3 days of throwing, 3-4 days drills, and 1 day of rest.\n\n, Long toss is very commonly used to strengthen the arm and to improve stamina. When you do long toss, you should begin at a close distance and move your way back, then when you are far enough, start moving in again.\n\n, If you have worked hard enough with your drills and throwing, attention should find you. You will feel good knowing that you don't have to show off to be noticed.\n\n, Any successful pitcher would agree that in order to be control on the mound, you must be in control of yourself. There are many books and articles written on the mental game that you can read.\n\n, Take your game seriously. Coaches respect a player who focuses in practice. Also, be open to constructive criticism from your coaches and maybe even from teammates.\n\n, You've worked all season for this. Try to remember all you can about what you have learned in the off-season. Many pitchers focus intensely on the game starting 1-2 hours before they take the mound.

Grip with your index and middle fingers across the seam at its widest point.\n\n, This pitch will appear to be a fastball, but will drop as it nears the batter, making it difficult to hit. You need large hands to throw this pitch effectively. Hold the ball as if you would for the two-seam fastball. Rotate the ball toward yourself, so your fingers are along the horseshoe seam. Spread your fingers to the outside of the seams and place your thumb directly under the ball.\n\n, This ball is almost impossible to hit when thrown well. Jam the ball between your index and middle finger.\n\n, This ball will wiggle as it moves towards the batter. Dig your fingernails into the middle of the ball seams.\n\n, Place both feet shoulder width apart standing straight on top of the mound with your toes dangling off the front, and face directly towards your catcher, your toes pointed towards him with your heels on the rubber. Hold your glove in front of your chest, with your elbows resting on both sides of your torso. Some pitchers prefer to stand with their stride leg slightly behind their other leg. This is optional and may not work for everyone. Your should start in the stretch position when there are runners on the bases. Place your feet so they face third base if you throw right-handed or first base if you throw left-handed. The stretch is a faster way to pitch and you can maintain more balance, resulting in more control. Your right foot should be placed against the rubber, with your other foot one to two inches in front. This will enable you to get a full rotation with your hips, which will make you throw harder. If you start with your stride leg slightly back, simply shift your weight to that back leg.\n\n, Shift your weight to your left foot, allowing you to lift your right foot and place it beside the rubber (or pivot your right foot into this position, whichever is more comfortable), so that the right side of your right foot is pressing against the mound.\n\n, Your body should have begun to move with your right foot in the previous step, and at the end of this step your body should be facing third base instead of home plate.\n\n, Your front arm should stay closed and your front elbow should be at a comfortable angle (45-90 degrees). Your throwing arm should hit what's called your \"sweet spot\" which is the point where you throwing arm is at its lowest point during your motion. Normally, it is at the point where your arm is nearly perpendicular to the ground, with a slight bend in your elbow. Ensure that your body stays facing third base through this step, and that you hit your sweet spot before continuing to the next step., Do this at the same time as moving your arms (the previous step). To lower your leg, bend your right knee until your left leg is close to the ground without touching the ground. Don't stride outwards until you have lowered your left leg fully or you will lose substantial power. Your front leg should have a curved \"down and out\" sweep towards home. As you are doing this, begin to raise your throwing arm out of the sweet spot so that is is parallel to the ground, without allowing your elbow to drop towards your hip.\n\n, In other words, if landing your foot pointing at the plate is a 90 degree angle, land your foot pointing at a 75 degree angle. This will get your body into a power position. Your power position is the position where your legs are fully extended with your hips and arms still closed, ready to hurl your arm towards the plate.\n\n, Pull forward with your front foot by pivoting from that 75 degree angle into a 90 degree angle. Ensure that you make this pivot before you swing open your upper body and pull your left arm towards first base. Pivoting early allows you to generate power with your hips, and create more of a whip action for your right arm. Your throwing elbow should be aligned with your shoulders (horizontally of course) through this step.The most common mistake pitchers make is to open their arms before their hips, which removes the power generated from their legs, causing pitchers to have less velocity, and increase the stress applied to their arms.\n\n, Do not snap your wrist as this can cause injury. Your wrist should not guide the ball, but rather the ball guides your wrist.\n\n\nDuring your motion, it is beneficial to be aware of your wrist. As you move your arm from your sweet spot, your wrist should be pulled back, cocking the ball in your hand. Then, as you release the ball, the ball should glide off of your wrist, finishing with your wrist fully flexed.\n\n, Extended your arm as far you can and allow your back leg to lift up from the forward momentum, and place it on the mound to get in a fielding position.\n\n, Pitching is really a series of movements that the pitcher does without thinking. The key to a great pitch is balance--without balance, your throw will more than likely be rather off kilter.\n\n, To be most effective, try to maintain a consistent throwing angle for all of your pitches. Some pitchers throw more overhand throwing a curveball or dip to sidearm while throwing a slider. While this may give you better control or command or your pitch, it can easily tip off the batter as to what pitch you are throwing. Having a consistent arm angle keeps the batter guessing.\n\n, Start off slow. Wrap ice around your arm and chest to slow down the buildup of lactic acid (the buildup of lactic acid causes soreness).\n\n\nRun for 30 minutes after you pitch. This will get your blood circulating and help push out the lactic acid that might form in your arm.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119049}
{"text":" Identify why you are pushing a person away, without passing judgment on the person. Close your eyes and visualize the person in your head. Then listen to yourself. How do you feel when you see this person's face? Threatened? Nervous? Name that feeling if you can.;\n, The majority of the time, people push others away because of an underlying issue with themselves. Usually this is a trust issue, commonly found in relationships. If you have been hurt in the past, it is understandable that you are wary of letting another person get that close to you ever again. The thought may even seem ridiculous. As hard as it may seem, you will trust again, provided you are open to the reality that there are many trustworthy people out there. With dedication to overcoming your own issues, you will conquer the negative feelings, to become the confident, strong person you are.\n\n, Perhaps you fail to keep communicating. Perhaps you say you'll do something but then you fail to follow through. It could even be your entire demeanor and mode of acting, a deliberate set of behaviors of yours, that allow you to treat somebody carelessly and only at a distance. Watch for actions such as: the fact that you keep a lot to yourself, or the fact that people are trying to help you and you just deny their help.\n\n\nFor example, if a friend tries to help you when you\u2019ve come out of a bad relationship, but you just refuse to be helped, you have just pushed away someone who could be a source of support and understanding. If you continue this behavior constantly, you risk alienating your friends and friends will not stay on your doorstep forever when you keep ignoring them.\n\n, Talking about the problem is a major step to opening up. It's simple, easy and incredibly refreshing. You don't have to go into detail; just to unload some feelings can be a world of help, and help you to realize that you're not alone in your feelings.\n\n\nLet out your feelings to a counselor or to your parents or someone you can trust. Explain to them why you push people away. Let the people who are closest to you in, so that they can help you.\nIf you don't like talking to other people about your problems, try talking to yourself in the mirror or journaling to help you understand your feelings about others.\n\n, Learn to trust yourself and believe in your own worth. If you crave the acceptance of others all the time but then fear their rejection, this sets up a vicious cycle of not wanting to get too close to them for fear of them letting you down, and in the process confirming that you're worthless. This is not the case\u2013\u2013you are worthy and you are the only person who can admit this and live true to it. Just as the people you care about matter, so too do you.\n\n\nThink positive thoughts whenever you feel down. Make a list of the things that make you special and unique. Ask somebody else to write down a thing or two\u2013\u2013this will give you a feeling of self worth.\n\n, Sure, some people will, but by not allowing yourself to get close to anyone, think of all the good relationships and connections you're missing out on. Also consider the overlooked experiences, such as shopping trips with the girls you wouldn't dare talk to in case they didn't like you, dates with the guy you thought was too good for you and making a business deal with the person you felt intimidated by. There are people out there who appreciate and even love you for who you are\u2013\u2013gravitate toward them and keep them in your life.\n\n\nLearn to keep your distance only after you've made an effort with people. Be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt at first, and see what happens.\n\n, If you feel as if you can't face the world today, plaster on a big smile, even when you feel like you want to cry. Confidence is a morale booster, even when it's faked. Repeat positive mantras in your head such as; I am strong and I can achieve anything. You will start to believe it.\n\n, It's hard for everyone to admit their feelings. However, it's essential in order to move on. Where you've treated people like dirt, you need to own up to it and develop a plan to set things right again., Realize that this will not be easy because the person may not trust you any longer and may be inclined to tell you to leave them be. You will need to persevere and to let them know that you're keen to discuss what made you push them aside and that you're no longer going to do that. It is likely that you will feel anxious and afraid but it's important to try to mend broken relationships that are of great importance to you. Remember that any assumptions you've made about them are quite likely to have been wrong.\n\n\nConvince yourself that if you don\u2019t want to lose a friend forever, you need to make some changes. Realize too that just getting an apology doesn\u2019t necessarily make the offended person feel better and forgiving. Remember that words are just words, it's the actions that rebuild a good relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Grab every opportunity and begin to take risks. This will help your confidence and help you meet as many new people as you can.\n\n, Now that you\u2019ve honestly put yourself in the corner, and realized what you need to do, go for it! Show your people how important they are to you, and that you\u2019d be really sorry to lose them.\n\n\nRemember that your words should reflect your actions. Stop talking and start making things happen instead.\nAdopt this mantra: What's the worst that could happen?\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119050}

Move to the edge of your chair so that your feet can rest flat on the floor.Generally you want to sit in a stable chair rather than a chair with wheels, if at all possible. If no non-wheeled chair is available, lock or block your wheels if you can so the chair won't roll.\nKeep a neutral back and roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades are falling down your back in line with your spine.;\n, The wrist stretch is particularly good for releasing tension if you have to type a lot at work. Doing wrist stretches periodically throughout the day can help reduce the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.Extend your arms in front of you so that your wrists are over your desk or table. Bend your hand upward so that your fingers reach upwards towards you. Try to flatten your palms as much as possible.\nHold the stretch, breathing deeply. Make sure your shoulders aren't hunched over and your shoulder blades are flowing down your back in line with your spine.\nRepeat the stretch as needed, either relaxing and stretching several times. You can do this stretch periodically throughout the day whenever your wrists feel tight or tense.\n\n, If you find you hold a lot of tension in your shoulders, the seated cow pose can help open them up. This is especially helpful if you have the tendency to hunch over your desk or computer.Lift one arm overhead and bend it at the elbow so that your hand drops behind your head. Reach your other arm up from behind and below until you can clasp the fingers of your top hand.\nPull until you feel a good stretch in your chest and shoulders. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, breathing deeply. Then release and repeat with the other side.\n\n, Yogic neck stretches can provide a gentle counter-stretch for the muscles that often get contracted or tightened when you're hunched over a computer, or stressed out at work.You can do these stretches sitting or standing, so they are perfect for any office environment. If you're sitting, check your posture and make sure both feet are flat on the floor.\nOn an exhale, drop your head to the left. Inhale back to center, then exhale and drop your head to the right. You can reach your arm overhead and use it to gently push your head in the direction of the stretch.

{"text":" The court is rectangular and measures 13.4 meters by 6.1 meters, approximately the same size as a badminton court. The net is in the middle of the court and should be 1.52m high.A service circle should be drawn 3.05m from the back line and 2.45m from the sidelines. The radius of the service circle should be 0.3m.Each corner has a free zone just outside the marked off court measuring 3m by 3m. A quarter circle with a radius of 0.9m extends from the sides of the center line.\n\n\nGet a Sepak Takraw ball, which should be spherical, about the size of a volleyball, and made from woven fiber.For women, the net should be 1.42m high.;\n, Sepak Takraw is played with two teams, called Regu and Mississauga. Each Regu has 5 total players - 3 players on the court and 2 substitutes.The server, also known as Tekong, stands in the center of the court. The Tekong serves the ball over the net. The goal is to serve it so it's hard for the other team to defend.\nThe left inside, also known as the Feeder, stands on the left front of the court. The Feeder has the most control over the ball during the game. They set the ball based on the Striker. They can spike the ball, and toss so the striker can strike. These players are usually very agile and responsive.The right inside, also known as the Striker or Killer, stands on the right front of the court. The goal of the Striker is to place the ball in the other team's court. They also block spikes from the other team., When playing the Regu format, a match consists of 3 sets. A match is won when a team wins 2 sets. Each set is played to 21 points.\n\n\nIf a team doesn't win 2 sets in a row, the third set, called the \"Tie-break,\" only has 15 points.\nIf the match is tied at 20-20, the winner is the first team to be ahead by 2 points, up to 25 points. For the Tie-break match, if the match is 14-14, the first time ahead by 2 points, up to 17 points, wins., In Sepak Takraw, you can't touch the ball with your hands or arms. That means you have to use your feet, legs, and knees to control the ball. Although it takes a bit of agility and athleticism, there are some basic moves you can learn.\n\n, The inside kick is probably the most important skill to learn because it's the one you'll use the most. This is used to control the ball. You can also use this kick for good spikes.\n\n\nFor this kick, stand with feet shoulder width apart with your support leg bent at the knee. Hit the ball with the inside of your dominant foot. Practice working with both feet to get more agility and flexibility in your kicks.When the ball comes towards you, lift the inside of your foot to connect with the ball.\nTo practice this kick, dribble the ball by kicking it up with the inside of your foot. Use a different foot each time the ball comes down.A variation of this kick uses the outside of the foot. When the ball comes at you and you can't get into position to use the inside of your foot, use the outside of it instead.\n\n, The toe kick is used to save the ball, not control it. Extend your leg. Let the ball bounce on your toe or raise your leg if the ball is higher. This should be executed slowly and without power.This is used when receiving the ball.\n\n\nWhen the ball comes to you from a low angle, bounce the ball off the top of your foot., The header is another pivotal skill for the game. This \"kick\" uses the head, preferably your forehead at your hair. This is used when the ball comes at you above the waist. You will probably have to bend down to get underneath the ball.\n\n\nPractice getting used to the feeling of the ball against your head because it can hurt. This is used in both serving and striking.\n\n, This kick is used when receiving the ball. The knee\/thigh kick deflects the ball when it's coming towards you between your waist and knees. By hitting the ball with your thigh or knee, you reposition the ball so you can use an inside kick. It is also used when the ball gets too close to your body.\n\n\nA knee and thigh kick is like a march step with a high knee. Using your thigh instead of your knee gives you better control. This is usually used with players who receive a serve. This kick should be be practiced with the inside kick.\n\n, Striking or spiking the ball sends it over the net. There are different ways to achieve this.\n\n\nStrike with the bottom of your foot. After bouncing the ball into the air, kick your leg up into the air to about head height. Then strike the ball with the bottom of your foot.Use the inner foot to strike the ball. After bouncing the ball high enough in the air, round your leg about shoulder height and hit the ball with the inside of your foot.Use the top of your foot to perform a back kick if you are in a position where you can't face the net. Kick your leg about shoulder height, making sure the top of your foot connects with the ball.For more power, do a combined kick. Start by kicking up the knee on your non-striking foot, then when that foot hits the ground, use that power to kick off the ground for a harder, faster strike.\nUse your head to strike by hitting the ball with your head. Make sure to lean forward to send the ball over the net instead of into the air., You can use any body part except the arms and hands when playing sepak takraw. You can use the chest and shoulders to bounce the ball off when trying to get it into proper play position.\n\n\nTry not to receive serves or strikes with the chest and shoulders.\n\n, The teams captains call it. Whoever calls correctly gets to choose to go first (called \"choosing service\") or choose the side they wish to be on (called \"choosing side\")., The designated team serves first. At the start of the match, the Feeder and the Striker stand in the quarter circle on their side of the court while the Tekong stands with one foot inside the serving circle.Either the Feeder or the Striker tosses the ball to the Tekong to start the match. He then kicks the ball up and over the net with the foot not in the serving circle.The other team can be anywhere in their court.\nThe serving team gets a point if the ball touches the net and lands in the court. The team continues to serve each time they are awarded a point.After the initial serve, all players are free to move around the court.\n\n, To respond to the serve, the defensive team will try to get the ball over the net within 3 touches of the ball. The Tekong and the Feeder both move around the court to pass the ball to the striker with 1-2 touches. The striker will use the final third touch to send the ball over the net.\n\n\nPlayers can have more than one touch., As play continues, the team cannot use their hands or arms. Each team has 3 touches to send the ball back over the net.\n\n\nPlay continues until a team makes a fault. This occurs when the team doesn't return the ball over the net within 3 touches, when the ball is not kicked before it hits the ground, the net stops it from going to the other side of the court, or it lands out of bounds. If a fault is made, the other team scores.\nWhen a team wins a point, they get the next serve.\n\n, After one team gets to 21 (or 25) points, the set is over. To start a new set, the teams change sides of the court. The team that lost the previous set serves. When a team wins two sets, a new match is started.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119059}
{"text":", Shooting, is simple to throw the ball you must have the ball face up in your hand. The ball must be thrown over head height otherwise it's a foul. To throw the ball you don't have to have it in both hands you can use the palm of your hand of a closed fist anything. If you're laying on the floor, you must extend your arms all the way up to throw the ball. If you're on your knees, then you should throw it a bit above your head height.\n\n, Scoring every time your opponent does not get to the ball in time and the ball hits the floor you are awarded 1 point to a preset number usually 2 sets of 21 if it continues to be a draw then go to penalties.\n\n, If you throw the ball out of the ring or the last person to touch the ball (that is if it's a legal throw) a point is awarded to the other player. If you catch the ball and you slide out of the circle court it is OK as long a tiny bit of your body still in the court. Hitting the ball on the line does count as in.\n\n, To start you flip a coin the winner of the coin flip is in the center of the circle court. The loser of the flip has there feet touching the circle but the rest of his body out of the court (laying down) they must throw the ball. As soon as he does he can get up the person can then throw it anywhere in the circle. Alternating. If it's a penalty from a foul then the fouler is the one laying down. If this is the start of the game or the start of a point you cannot win.\n\n, To play doubles or triples its the same rules but you must have an order so you always throw to the same player once the point is over alternate so you throw now only to the other player. During the start, penalty or foul two players must be anywhere outside the circle until the person laying down has the ball.\n\n\nFor Uneven numbers, You go around in a pattern until someone says at the end a point switch and then the order reverses. Penalty, foul, beginning of game and point you do it normally with the extra player out on the side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Last team to have players left wins.\n\n, This game has no preset court; it can be square, circle (usually it's a circle), oval. Just make it the correct size fitted for who you playing with and have fun!\n\n, Same rules as doubles but no set person to throw to just anyone on the other team.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119060}
{"text":" Making lists may not seem like something that will help you win. But, think of it this way\u2014winners make lists. Thinking of all the things you will need for game day will reduce stress so that you can keep your mind on the game. Write down the date of the tournament, equipment you will need, your meal plan, and training schedule. Free your mind so you can visualize that winning move.Important information includes information about transportation, food, drink, and what will happen in an emergency.\nBring a notebook with you to practice. Then you can write down important notes right away.;\n, It is a good idea to make sure that you have the equipment, uniform, and shoes needed. If you find that some of the equipment is old or missing, go ahead and buy new equipment, a water bottle, etc. This is one less thing you have to stress about as it gets closer to game day.Check that the equipment is up to standard. There is nothing worse than turning up on game day and finding your equipment is broken.\n\n, No, this doesn\u2019t mean to sit back with a bag of chips and your favorite show. It\u2019s important to keep your mind and body in great shape, but don\u2019t overdo it. Taper the intensity of your training about two weeks before the tournament. This reduces the chance of injury and ensures that you\u2019re well rested for the big day.You may not have a say in how much training you do if you train with a team. In this case, cut down the training you do on your own time.\n\n, It\u2019s hard to argue with the idea of getting more sleep. Try to increase the amount of sleep you get to 10 hours. Sorry, but this may mean cutting back on late night binge watching and video games. It will be worth it though. Get extra sleep and stick to that schedule so you guaranteed to be well rested when it comes to game day.Keep a sleep diary to manage your sleep habits. There are also smartphone apps that help with this.\n\n, Getting enough water is really important\u2014especially for an athlete like yourself. Staying hydrated is important when you\u2019re training and sweating a lot. Try to drink 1.5 or more liters of water a day. Keep a water bottle with you at all times to make staying hydrated easy.Mix your water with fruit to give it some taste if you\u2019re usually not a fan of drinking water.\nSodas are a guilty pleasure, but you should stay away from them. They don\u2019t do much for hydration.\n\n, Do this about one week before the tournament. This doesn\u2019t mean skipping meals or hardly eating anything at all. Slightly reducing the size of your meals will prevent weight gain that may happen because of lower intensity training. Unfortunately, that means no large pizzas, cheesy bread, soda, and ice cream for dinner tonight. That can be a reward for after the tournament!, Okay, now it\u2019s getting close to the big game! You may be feeling some anxiety, but you can reduce that by having everything prepared. Make a list of everything you will need. Go ahead and pack your bag. Pack your equipment, uniform, towels, and anything you will need for the tournament. Check items off of the list as you go.Put the bag by the door or in an obvious place so that you don\u2019t walk out without it in your excitement to play the game.\n\n, Let your body know that it\u2019s about to do some hard work. Eat a meal that\u2019s high in carbs and protein. This will boost your glycogen levels. A great meal to have would be pasta and salmon. It\u2019s yummy and beneficial!, This is a great excuse to kick back earlier than usual. Try to have your dinner a little earlier than usual. It may be difficult, but turn off the TV, computer, and smart phone as early as possible. Use this time to meditate on the game or read a good book.Stop drinking caffeine around 12 p.m.\n\n, Try to avoid letting anxious, negative thoughts enter your mind. It\u2019s normal to have them, but focus on the positive. Go through the game play in your mind. Imagine the moment that you win. Play this over and over in your mind until success seems like the only reasonable outcome., A breakfast that is rich in carbs is ideal. This will give you a vital energy boost and prevent you from going hungry later in the day. A donut is a carb, but you can do better than that. Avoid a lot of sugar and high fat proteins. Cereal, milk, and a banana would be a good option., You don\u2019t want to show up to the tournament with a growling stomach and realize you don\u2019t have anything to eat. Pack something like a sandwich and fruit for lunch. For a snack, things like nuts, bananas, granola bars, and dried fruit are ideal. Keep snacking up until right before the tournament, but don\u2019t get too full. All of this food and drink will keep you energized during the tournament, and will help you play the best you can.Make sure to bring a refillable water bottle.\n\n, Nap for about two hours before you leave for the tournament, and make sure to set an alarm. You definitely don\u2019t want to wake up and realize the tournament has already passed. A nap time of about 20 minutes would be ideal, though you can adjust the time to your liking. A short nap will give you an extra energy and performance while you play., Accidents and traffic are impossible to control, but it would be a good idea to do everything you can to prevent showing up late. Map the location of the tournament before you leave. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to plan a few alternative routes as well. Leave for the tournament with so much time to spare that not even a fallen tree, traffic accident, or stop for gas could make you late., Being nervous will only hinder your performance, even if it is normal and expected. Take a moment to step aside and sit back. Reflect on all of the hard work that led you to this moment. Close your eyes and meditate. When your thoughts have steadied, get up and get prepared to win this game., Your mind might be racing before the game\u2014thinking of past and future games. Resist the temptation to dwell on anything except the present moment. Don\u2019t think about what this tournament means for your future in the sport. Just think about how you can be the best you can be. It\u2019s okay if your mind drifts. Recognize you\u2019re doing it and refocus., You shouldn\u2019t overdo it, but it is important that your body is prepared for what its about to endure. Run a few laps. Stretch your muscles out. Do whatever you have to do for your particular sport. Then all that\u2019s left to do is have fun.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119061}
{"text":" It's wise nowadays in futsal to wear protective padding as a goalkeeper, as quite often a save will require you to dive onto the hard ground. Knee pads, arm pads and some long pants will reduce the risk of injury, letting you play to the best of your ability.;\n, When playing as a futsal goalkeeper you are required to protect a goal roughly 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) wide by 6\u00a01\u20442 feet (2.0\u00a0m) high. When positioning yourself you should always be careful of how much of the goal you are covering or not.\n\n, When the opposition performs a breakaway there are 2 main ways to block the shot, the 1st way implies the strikers are running through onto a throughball, when this happens its best to surprise them. A fast full paced sprint to intercept or kick the ball away will surprise your opponent forcing them to shoot if they can. The 2nd way implies a pass direct to the striker leaving it between you and your opponent to battle. With this style its best to be crouched down a little with your '5 hole closed' to prevent a shot. its best to come out far enough to be able to block the goal with your feet if a low shot is taken while still being able to watch for a chip and parry\/catch it.\n\n, If the opportunity presents itself the opposing team might be awarded a penalty. Penalties are quite intense due to the distance between you and the taker being quite small. As with most goalkeeping penalty tactics, it's best to make yourself as big as possible. Unless you definitely know where the shot will be try to stay in the center as long as possible as most goalies can touch side to side without moving much in their goal.\n\n, Free kicks are quite dangerous as they can be right up quite close to your circle. The advantage of penalties is that free kicks allow your team to have a wall. I find its best to have a 2 person wall with a dead on free kick and a 1 person wall with a side on. The remaining players should position themselves goalside of the attackers to prevent a lay off shot.\n\n, Corner kicks can be deadly as a quick fast paced ball into the middle can leave you stranded to make the save. However when positioning yourself its best to take charge. I find its best to be at the front post while being crouched down a little with your foot on the post to prevent a low shot on the post or a diving save to prevent a low cross in the middle. With airborne crosses that require a header shot its best to punch the ball away in mid air before anyone can touch it.\n\n, Depending on the rest of your teams capabilities, you can push forward out of your box to take side kicks and in some cases half-field shots. Of course if you do partake in this there is a chance of an intercepted ball enabling a shot on your goal while you're halfway up the field.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119062}
{"text":" Most cricket bat cracks can be repaired with glue and repair tape or twine, plus some sandpaper and oil. First of all, locate the crack and fill it completely with glue, such as wood glue or superglue.Remove any excess glue and allow it to dry for 12 to 24 hours. After that:\n\n\nSand the area down with a sandpaper between 100 and 220.Oil the repaired area with raw linseed oil\nBind the area with bat tape or twine. If you use twine, soak the twine with glue as you wrap the bat.;\n, To repair these types of cracks, follow the same initial steps as you would for toe cracks. Once you have filled the crack with glue, cover the bat with two pieces of wood (one on either side) and clamp it in place while the glue dries.Once the glue has dried, follow the same steps for sanding, oiling, and taping.\nIf you don\u2019t have a clamp to use, cut up strips from an old bat grip and use those as elastics to clamp the bat as the glue dries., Sometimes the handle on a cricket bat can fall out of the body, and this can be reattached with glue. Cover the handle with wood glue and reinsert it into the body of the bat.\n\n\nUse a rubber mallet to tap the handle into place. Remove any excess glue.\nTape or clamp the bat to hold the handle firmly in place and allow the glue to cure for at least 48 hours.\nFor added support, insert wood screws into the body and through the handle to keep the handle in place.\n\n, As soon as you notice wear or cracking on the rubber handle, replace it right away. After you gently roll the new grip on, tape it with bat tape.\n\n, Store your bat somewhere that\u2019s not too hot and never wet or damp.Never store your bat in a hot car or any other hot area, as it can warp the wood. If the bat ever gets wet, dry it with a cloth and store it somewhere cool to dry. When it has dried, apply a thin layer of oil.\n\n, At the end of each season, remove the anti-scuff sheet. Apply a layer of oil and let it sit for 24 hours. Then, apply a second coat of oil and let it rest for a week. Sand it down and repeat the oiling process.

{"text":" Baseball gloves are made of leather, so you\u2019ll want oils and products that are specifically made for leather. The glove manufacturer will probably offer recommendations for oils and conditioners that will work well with their product, which you should be able to purchase at a sporting goods store.Some other common materials that are useful for breaking in the glove include baby oil, petroleum jelly, shaving cream, and saddle soap.;\n, Put a little bit of oil into the pocket, the areas between your thumb and forefinger where you catch balls, and rub it in so that you get a light coating. Make sure there are no globs of oil or other liquids left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to just use your hands, a soft, clean cloth is a good idea. Put a small amount into a clean dish towel, and rub that into the glove., Let the glove sit overnight in order for the oil to fully soak into the leather. Make sure it stays in a cool, dry place. The next morning, wipe the glove dry to remove any remaining oil., This is the last step to breaking in a glove. The best way to do this is by playing catch for a few minutes every day for a few weeks. This will help make the glove form better to your hand, and give you the comfort you want while playing.There are a few other popular methods for making a pocket. Place a baseball or softball into the pocket and tie the glove shut, repeating that process every night after giving it some use. Alternatively, use a hammer to pound the pocket in.\n\n, Once you are done for the day, either in a game or just playing catch, wipe down the glove with a clean rag. Get rid of any dirt or debris on it, and store in a cool, dry place daily., To give your glove a better clean, put a little bit of cleaner on a damp cloth or sponge. Make sure you wipe the entire glove with the cleaner. This includes parts other than the pocket, including the laces and webbing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you use the right kinds of leather cleaners. Look for designated baseball glove leather cleaners, or products recommended by the manufacturer. Avoid oil conditioners like linseed oil, mink oil, neatsfoot oil, silicon, or petroleum-based products.\nKeep your application light. Too much cleaner, or applying it too often, will cause the leather to break down faster.\nYou probably want to do this once a year to help keep your glove lasting for a long time.\n\n, Use a damp cloth or sponge to wipe off any remaining oil. Then let your glove air dry overnight. Make sure you find a cool, dry place for your glove to sit, which means not in your gym or bat bag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leather will be a bit stiff after drying, but some regular use should soften it up again quickly.\n\n, You want to make sure you don\u2019t overdo it when you apply cleaner. Make sure you don\u2019t soak the leather. Too much will make it deteriorate faster, the opposite of what you want., Remember that your glove is made of leather, a specific kind of material. Not all oils are good on leather, and because it is a common material, they will usually say so on the label. Using these oils will break down the material and cause your glove to deteriorate faster., Keep your glove in a cool, dry place when you are done oiling. Do not use a blow dryer, furnace, or dryer to dry it off. The extra heat will damage the glove, especially since you\u2019ll be letting it sit overnight and not carefully watching it., Cooking your glove in a microwave is a good way to dry out the leather, making the laces brittle and more likely to break. You can also start a fire if you aren\u2019t watching carefully. Some gloves have metal parts in them as well, which create sparks that will catch fire and damage your microwave.This goes for other heating methods like ovens or your car. While your glove probably won\u2019t catch fire sitting on the dashboard, it will still dry out and become brittle.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119066}
{"text":" Most U.S. school baseball seasons end around June. This gives you about nine months until tryouts in March. During this time, objectively evaluate your strengths and weaknesses. Asking your current coaches how you can improve is a good start, and will leave a good impression.Try to get on a fall team in order to keep your skills sharp. Fall is a time to improve your game and work on things for the spring such as throwing a new pitch, bunting, hitting to the opposite field, etc.\nIn the winter, if possible, work with a coach specifically to get better at fielding, hitting, and\/or pitching.;\n, Talk to the coach or another person whose opinion you trust about what areas need work. Focus your energies on improving those aspects of your game, while at the same time not ignoring your overall skill-building and conditioning regimen.Becoming a better defender can help separate you from the pack. Work on positioning yourself properly, catching fly balls, scooping up grounders, and throwing on target.\nNo matter how fast you are, working on your base running skills \u2014 like sliding and rounding the bases properly \u2014 will also pay dividends., For pitchers, control is more important than velocity. Work on the hitting the strike zone first, then work on velocity. Remember that velocity is enhanced by proper mechanics, which also benefit control.During the offseason, focus on developing a smooth, repeatable delivery and accuracy in your pitches. Don\u2019t wear out your arm by trying to hurt your catcher\u2019s hand.\n\n, Bat speed is essential to making the ball go far. Sensible strength training can help increase bat speed, but proper form and technique are at least as important. Work with a hitting coach or look on the internet for drills to improve your swing.Take batting practice regularly, from a machine or \u2014 even better \u2014 a live pitcher. Work on your plate discipline, so you can quickly differentiate a good pitch to hit from a ball off the plate.\n\n, School baseball teams often have limited rosters, so you\u2019ll better your odds of making the team if you can play multiple positions and fill multiple roles. Even if you prefer the infield, work on your outfield skills as well. Practice bunting and base-stealing so you can be used as a pinch hitter or pinch runner. And teams can almost always use another catcher, since many players shy away from this physically and mentally demanding position.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119067}

If this happens in the playoffs, whoever had a better record in the regular season will move on to the next round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, As you get further and further into the season, you will want to see how you are doing compared to the other teams in the league. To find this you have to go to Standings which is located on your league's homepage. When you go here it will show you everything you need to know, including your record, points scored, how many games you are out of the playoffs, etc.\n\n, The two division winners and the two next best teams make the playoffs. If you do make the playoffs then you will play in a sudden death match against your opponent. Whoever wins, goes on to the finals, the loser is out for the season. The winner of the finals is crowned as champion and gets all of the glory and bragging rights for next season.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119068}
{"text":" A team can make a double play in baseball in several different ways.\n\n\nGround-ball double play: This is the most common double play because it usually is executed by forcing out both runners rather than tagging out one or both. If a ground ball is hit to an infielder or the pitcher with a runner on first base, the fielder will throw the batted ball to a player covering second base. The player must catch the ball while in contact with the base, and then throw the ball to a teammate covering first base before the batter reaches it.\nGround-ball double play with tag: A fielder can elect to tag the runner instead of throwing to the base the runner is approaching to record the first out and then throw to first to complete the double play. Sometimes a first baseman step on first base after fielding a ground ball, and then throw to second to record the double play. In this case, the runner is no longer forced to run, so the player receiving the throw from the first baseman must apply a tag on the base runner to record the second out.\nUnassisted double play: An infielder can turn an unassisted double play under certain circumstances. This occurs most often when a player catches a line drive near an occupied base. If the defender is able to touch the base or tag the runner before he safely returns, the double play is recorded.\nFly-ball double play: A double play can be made on a fly ball to the outfield. Normally, this occurs when a baserunner tags up and tries to advance after the ball is caught. If the outfielder throws the ball to a teammate covering a base or home plate, and that player tags the runner before he reaches that base, the double play is successful.\nStrike-out, caught-stealing double play: If a batter strikes out and a baserunner is caught stealing on the same play, a double play is recorded. Fans call this kind a strike-'em-out, throw-'em-out double play.;\n, Ground-ball double plays are the most common and easy to practice. The key is for all the infielders to move in simultaneously as the play unfolds.\n\n\nOn balls hit to the left side of the infield, to either the third baseman or shortstop, other infielders must get into position to turn the double play. The second baseman must move to cover the base as the ball comes to the fielder. Ideally, the second baseman will be at or near the base before the throw is made.\nOn balls hit to the right side of the infield \ufffd to either the first or second baseman \ufffd the shortstop must rush to second as his teammate fields the ball.\nIf not making the play on the ground ball himself, the first baseman should move to cover first base immediately, getting in a comfortable position to receive the throw. A relay throw can be errant on a double play because the baserunner is sliding hard into second base, trying to disrupt the fielder's effort.\nA middle infielder \ufffd shortstop or second baseman \ufffd sometimes will field a ground ball in close proximity to second base. The fielder may elect to carry the ball to the base himself, touch it, and throw to first to complete the double play. This reduces the chance of an error occurring on the relay exchange.\n\n, An outfielder can ready himself for a throw to any base by practicing a few simple techniques.\n\n\nMove to the area where you will catch the ball.\nAs the ball starts its downward trajectory, glance at the base you plan to throw to.\nAfter picking up the flight of the ball again, edge closer to where you're going to catch it.\nCatch the ball while moving toward the base you're going to throw to. The momentum will put more power behind your throw, helping you to cut down a runner trying to advance.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119069}

{"text":" Fill your first slot with one of your three best hitters. To decide between them, prioritize speed on the ground over power at bat. Save the guy who hits the most home runs for when bases are loaded. But don\u2019t choose a weak hitter just because he happens to be the fastest runner, because your lead-off is likely to come up to bat the most often!Look for these strengths to determine who should fill the #1 spot: Speed\nBunting\nStealing bases\nGets to base often\nMakes regular contact with the ball\nRarely strikes out;\n, Again, choose between one of your three best hitters. Since the fastest of the three has already been picked as #1, decide between the two remaining. Choose the one who delivers the most consistent performance, rather than the most powerful hits, to ensure that your lead-off has a chance to make it to second or third base.Pick the player who is best at:.\n\n\nSacrifice bunts\nHit-and-runs\nGetting on base\n\n, Bring your #1 and #2 hitters home (or at least closer to it) by selecting your best all-around hitter to bat right after them. Base your decision on both power and consistency. Pick the player who is able to send balls the farthest into the outfield. However, prioritize a high batting average over pure power. If this means loading all three bases instead of driving #1 all the way home, go with that. Your #3 hitter should ideally:Be comfortable hitting all sorts of pitches.\nHave a high rate of runs batted in (RBI).\nBe able to hit home runs and doubles occasionally, if not often.\nHave a high batting average.\n\n, Note whoever begins as your second hitter is likely to come to bat more often. Be aware that some people consider this to mean that it is wiser to bump your #3 pick (who is your best overall hitter) up one slot. Consider whether or not you wish to do the same.\n\n, This position is known as the \u201ccleanup,\u201d so choose the player who is most likely to do just that: clean those bases of runners. Pick whoever is most likely to hit home-runs or, failing that, to send the ball way, way out into the outfield. Force your opponents\u2019 defense to waste time chasing after it and passing it back to the infield. Give your #1, #2, and #3 hitters as much time as possible to reach home., Since they may have a less than perfect batting average, expect your #4 hitter to strike out on occasion. When they do, follow them up with the next best power hitter. Give your first three hitters another chance to make it to home plate. Or, if #4 was successful at bat, give them a chance to reach the next base, too., Understand that the traditional method of making a lineup is to use your very best hitters for the first three spots and then fill out the remaining slots with your fourth-best hitter, then your fifth, sixth, and so on. However, be aware that there is some debate about this. Consider this:Because the #3 hitter is likely to come up to bat more often in one game than #4 and #5 will, the traditional logic holds that you are better off filling that position with the power-hitter who has the highest batting average.\nHowever, even though #4 and #5 may have fewer opportunities to bat in one game, they are more likely to do so with more than one base loaded.\nBecause of this, some people believe that the smarter move is to reserve the more consistent hitter for the fourth or fifth hole.\n\n, You may have a solid team of players who are very close to each other in terms of talent, or the dropoff in batting skills may be very apparent from player to player. Either way, review each player\u2019s strengths and weaknesses as a hitter. Weigh these concerns against what you are likely to need most from a given hole at the bottom of your lineup.Traditionally, #6 through 9 is usually determined by the remaining players\u2019 respective talent and placing them in descending order, with your worst hitter going last.\n\n, Unless you are blessed with an all-star team of power hitters, expect your remaining players to be more proficient at only hitting singles. So, in the event that both your first- and second-pick cleanups strike out, fill out the next two slots according to who has the best record of hitting the ball. Improve your odds of bringing baserunners home while your team is still at bat.If your sixth and seventh best players are pretty close in performance levels, base your decision on who is better at stealing bases.Filling the #6 spot with a strong base-stealer will increase your chances of driving this baserunner closer and closer to home, even if #7, #8, and #9 can only hit singles.\n\n, Now that you are down to your two worst hitters, figure out where you want to place the absolute worst. Consider the dropoff in talent across the middle of your lineup. Figure out what situations you are likely to face as the batting rotation nears its bottom.If you have a strong team who can reach the bottom of the lineup with only one out, perhaps stick to the traditional method of placing your worst hitter last. This way, if they strike out, they will be immediately followed by one of your best players.\nIf you expect to have two or more outs well before that, think of your eighth and ninth hitter in terms of your first and second. Since they may likely be starting the rotation next inning, pick who goes first according the same criteria that you used to pick your lead-off.\n\n, Research the other team's pitchers. Review any past games that you may have played against them. Consider switching your batters to different holes in your lineup if you think this will give you an advantage. For example:\n\n\nIf you have a fairly even number of left- and right-handed batters, alternate between the two to pose a constant challenge.If their pitcher is left-handed, reevaluate each batter's performance against such pitchers.\nReview each batter's past performances against individual pitchers. For example, if your sixth-best batter overall happens to fare better against one pitcher, consider bumping them up.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119071}

The best way would be to run at least 2\u20133 miles (3.2\u20134.8\u00a0km) everyday. Try to gradually increase your distance over time.;\n, In order to be a good ball-handler, you need to dribble a basketball wherever you go and whenever you can. Always start your workout with intense sessions of dribbling by focusing on your crossovers, behind the back, change of direction, in and out, and pull back and crossover.\n\n, This is another key element and must be practice every single day. The best way to practice would be to have a group of 2-3 people where one person rebounds, the other passes the ball, and the last person shoots. It is optimal to shoot about 300-500 shots per day.\n\n, This is something that is often avoided despite its importance to the game. You should try to grab another person and do 1-on-1 guarding where one person dribbles in a zig zag fashion and the other has to closely guard. In addition, you can always practice on your defensive slides alone and try to stay in a stance for at least a minute at a time.\n\n, This is a skill that requires timing and boxing out. The best way to work on your timing is throwing the ball off the backboard and try to catch it at the apex of your jump. In addition, you should work on your jumping ability by doing squats and other leg strengthening exercises.\n\n\nExercising is important because it trains you physically for playing high level basketball.\n\n, Perfect practice makes your work perfect. You always have to play games everyday. It will help you home in on the skills that you need to work on.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119072}

Look for many local contests to increase your chances of winning by drawing.\n\n, The season ticket holders for the year's championship teams usually get the right to buy tickets to the game at face value. In 2011, the Cardinals allowed those who bought season tickets for the next year to buy a current world series ticket at face value.\n\n, Although season ticket holders get the chance to purchase at face value, this may also be possible if you purchase the tickets online, by phone or at the stadium box office before or right after the team qualifies.\n\n\nAllotted team tickets sell out very quickly after the team qualifies. One year they sold out within 18 minutes of going on sale.\n\n, StubHub is an affiliate of eBay and a partner of Major League Baseball and most of the American and National league teams. The following are good tips for buying baseball tickets on this secondary market:\n\n\nStubHub has the advantage of guaranteeing your tickets, unlike some other websites. They have agreed to a process of reselling series tickets for the MLB. Once you buy a seat from an existing ticket, they deactivate the old ticket bar code and they create a new bar code for them. They will send you the tickets by email in Portable Document Format (PDF).\nGo to the \"World Series\" section on StubHub.com site.

Buy a ticket with a credit card as soon as you find the tickets. They are not likely to be available at the same price for long.\nSearch for tickets during the playoff games. Buying tickets before the teams are set allows you the option of a refund. StubHub knows that even if you ask for a refund, they can always resell it to an eager fan. As soon as the game is decided, ticket prices will go up by $100 to $1,000.\nSet a \"Price Alert.\" You can name a price that you are willing to pay and you will receive word if there is a ticket available. This is a good way to stay within a budget.\nTickets are sold up to 2 hours before the game. Prices may go down as the game nears, because the seller will not benefit from having an empty seat.\n\n, Sometimes tickets become available if there are open seats. If there is an agreement between the team and StubHub, you may be redirected to their website to purchase the tickets.\n\n, Tickets occasionally become available and are sold at the gate up to 2 hours before the game. This is rare, but others may assume that there are no tickets.\n\n\nBuy tickets at the bigger stadium, if you have an option between the 2.

{"text":" Place the head of the bat on the ground in front of your lead foot. Grab the handle with your bottom hand or non-dominant hand. For example, if you are a right-handed hitter, your bottom hand and lead foot will be your left.This creates a slight angle to your bet which helps generate an extra whip to your wrist.;\n, Bend the index finger of your bottom hand around the bat. Separate the bottom three fingers that are also wrapped around the handle. Point your knuckle up the barrel of the bat.Try to keep the bat off of the palm of your hand as you hold it with your fingers.\n\n, Grab the handle similar to your bottom hand, with the handle in your fingers. Your index finger should be separate from the bottom three fingers but all four fingers should be gripping the handle with your thumb in a comfortable position.The second knuckles of your fingers should basically be all aligned.\n\n, Keep your grip relaxed as you hold the bat. Your grip will automatically tighten through the swing motion. Your grip will be the strongest as you make contact through the baseball. Focus on a light grip as you begin your swing.Keeping a tight grip will create fatigue in your fingers and muscles. It will also result in a slower, weaker swing. Grip with your fingers and pad of your hands., Your grip needs to enable your wrists to move well so that you can properly create bat lag and deliver the bat head to the ball. Bat lag is the relationship of your hands to the head of the bat as your swing progresses through contact. As you swing, your hands will come forward but your bat head will be left behind.The bat head is whipped around at the last instant by your wrists, but primarily by the wrist of your top hand. You want to generate as much bat speed through this whipping action and an improper grip can inhibit your wrists from generating the full potential.\n\n, Your upper body should mimic your grip and be relaxed. The more explosive the movement, the more relaxed your body needs to be. You want to uncoil your muscles and explode into your hit., Make sure your shoulders aren\u2019t level. You want there to be some tilt to your shoulders to create some explosion., Look at where your bat will make contact relative to where you have your hands gripped on the handle. The strongest grip is when the palm of your top hand is facing up and the palm of your bottom hand is facing down.Your hands should be parallel to the ground if you open both your hands. The thumb of your top hand will prevent the bat from getting knocked backwards as your grip tightens to make contact with the baseball.\nThe range of your knuckles should allow you to make contact with the ball with one palm up and the other down. To find this, pick your bat up and align your middle knuckles. Take a half swing, as if you\u2019re making contact with the ball, and hold the position. How are you gripping the bat?, You should be balanced with your weight on the balls of your feet as you slightly bend your knees. Stand slightly wider than shoulder width apart to ensure your lower body is properly engaged and ready to engage into your hit. You want to take a short stride as your lower body rotates with the rest of your upper body to create maximum power for your hit.Avoid leaning back on your heels because it will make it difficult to keep balance as you move forward into your swing. Having too much weight transfer as you uncoil into your hit will reduce your speed and power.\nDon\u2019t keep your feet too close together because it might be difficult to keep your head level, time the pitch, keep your balance, and adjust to pitches that are off-speed. Having your feet too close together is known as overstriding and is common amongst beginners. In contrast, if your feet are too wide apart, you will decrease your power because you won\u2019t be using your entire weight as your body rotates into your swing.\nOpen up your stance if you are having problems seeing the pitcher and the ball. You want to be able to see the ball with both eyes.\n\n, Keep your hands at the top of the strike zone and your feet slightly more than shoulder width apart. You want you swing to be fluid through the strike zone. Any small adjustment will decrease your speed and your power.Avoid getting \u201chappy feet\u201d. This means moving around when already in your batting stance. The added movement can disrupt your timing. Relax and focus on the pitch.\n\n, Play around with your grip so that you feel the effect when you have one palm up and one down when you make contact with the ball. One grip may feel easier than the other.You may find that if you align your middle knuckles your wrist rolls too early. You may find that if you align the middle knuckles of your bottom hand with the big knuckles of your top hand you have hard time holding on to the bat upon contact. You may also find yourself becoming more tense and forcing your shoulders to tilt in order to get into position rather than allowing a more natural motion. The size of your hands may cause you to adjust your grip to find your natural swing., You need to be confident and comfortable with your grip so don\u2019t be afraid to slightly adjust when you\u2019re consistently running into the same problems. You may be rolling your wrists early if you are topping the ball. Close your grip by bringing the middle knuckles of your bottom hand closer to the big knuckles of the top hand.Bringing your middle knuckles closer may aid you in coming through a better path through the hit zone. This can prevent constant pop ups. A tight grip may create unneeded tension in a swing and reduce your power. This may be the first reason why you are having difficulty hitting. There may be many reasons why you are finding problems but first focus on finding a grip you are comfortable with., The angle of your bat as you stand ready with the bat cocked back factors into how effective of a hitter you are. Angle your bat straight up and down. This creates a loop in your swing.The extra length in the back swing generates more power from this position because you\u2019re increasing the space to speed up your bat.\n\n, Lay the bat flat and parallel to the ground as it is ready to explode into your swing. This shortens the back part of your swing and creates a direct path to the pitch.Because your bat is travelling a shorter distance than if it were angled up, you will not generate as much power.\n\n, Find an angle that is comfortable to you. Most people find an angle that is in between parallel to the ground and straight up. This will depend on what type of hitter you are and how you intend to control the baseball bat.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119074}

After that try to get a light jog in.;\n, Try to stay close to your partner at first and when you start to get warm, take a step back each time you receive the ball. This process is called long tossing. Once your arm is feeling good, take a step forward every time you receive the ball until you and your partner are 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) away.\n\n, Go over the signs and what kinds of pitches you will throw that game. Then sit in the dugout as your team practices and takes infield. Be sure to wear something warm to keep your arm warm.\n\n, Bullpen is a practice pitchers mound where a pitcher can warm up. In the Bullpen try to test all your pitches out and see if your fastball and your off speed is working. This way you can know what pitch is working for you or know what pitch is the best that day.\n\n, If the catcher says any pitch is not working for you that day, then don't throw that pitch in the game. Try to work on some of the off speed pitches like curve ball, change up, knuckle or any other off speed pitches. That way the catcher can also get used to your off speed pitches.\n\n, If your arm is hurting in the Bullpen then be sure to tell your coach, because you will rather miss one game then pitching with a hurt arm and sitting out the rest of the season. The coach will probably ask you \"how is your arm hurting?\" If he asks any question don't be scared to tell the truth.\n\n, This is the best part of baseball. When the game starts and it is your turn to pitch go to the mound and throw a couple of times. There is usually a hole where the pitchers step on the front side of the mound, so if that bothers you try to kick some dirt in there and cover up the mound.\n\n, If you can't see the catcher's sign take a time out and talk to him. The catcher then will use his body parts as a sign instead of his fingers.

Start by running every day, even if you can't run the whole time. By being active you increase strength. Elliptical training and stairs are also helpful in training the leg muscles you will need as a successful cheerleader. Do one of these in 10 minute intervals several times a day. Every week increase the incline or speed by 1 point.\n\n, A popular training circuit counts down from thirty by tens. 30 jumping jacks, 30 crunches, 30 push ups, and 30 seconds of a plank. Do not stop between rounds. Take a ten second break at the end of each circuit and start again with twenty, then ten. Do this circuit once a day everyday.\n\n, The most common is a toe touch, but squads usually require four or five. To increase your height in jumps, place a piece of tape 12\" above your extended hand. Start in a crouched position and jump up to touch the tape. Only count the reps where you reach full height, and try to do 10-15 a day to start. Also do the jumps you must know repeatedly, about 5-10 each.\n\n, Stretch twice a day, when you get up in the morning and before you go to bed. Particularly stretch your thighs and legs with straddle stretches. Do the lunge, kneeling lunge, kneeling reverse lunge, straddle, pike, splits, quad stretch, shoulder stretch, tricep stretch, bridge, etc. Hold each stretch for 10 seconds and repeat the stretches 3 times a stretching session.\n\n, Depending on previous flexibility, lean forward on your hands or forearms. Slowly, lift a leg one at a time a few inches above the ground, lower, and repeat. Try for 10 a day on each leg. If your hips lock up, do a pike stretch and try again. When you have mastered lifting, try circling your feet in the air before lowing for a more advanced movement.\n\n, Private or group lessons can give you personalized training on jumps and tumbling. Do not be afraid to ask for help! Tumbling is very important in advanced cheerleading but can be difficult to learn, give it time.

Practice both the side split and the front split to ensure your legs are as limber as possible.For a side split, stand with a wide, straight-legged stance. Spread your legs slightly more than shoulder-width apart, and lower yourself down to the ground.\nFor a front split, put one leg out in front of you, and one leg behind you. Place your hands on the floor and slowly slide your front leg forward until your reach the floor, keeping your toes pointed.\nFor an additional challenge, when you\u2019re in the front splits, bend your back knee so your foot points toward you. This will help you achieve your scorpion.\n\n, Lay flat on the floor on your stomach. Place your palms flat on the ground underneath your shoulders, and flex your feet so that your toes are touching the floor. Keep your abs tight and raise your body off the ground, so that your weight is resting on your hands and feet. Be sure to keep your back straight. Try to hold the plank for 30 seconds., Doing yoga increases both your balance and your flexibility. Look for a cheap or free class in your area, and sign up. Follow along with the instructor, and ask them to make sure you are using the right technique. You could also get a yoga DVD or follow along with online tutorials., A great way to improve your balance is to use a balance beam. Walk along the beam and practice keeping your center of gravity over the beam. Keep practicing until you no longer need to hold your hands out for support and can walk the entire length of the beam in under 6 seconds., Work up to balancing on one foot for a minute. Use a little support if needed. Then switch, and balance on the other foot. It\u2019s important to exercise both sides so that one side doesn\u2019t become weaker than the other., Stand on the board with your feet shoulder-width apart. Tighten your abs and rock backward, forward, and side to side. Keep trying until you can balance for one minute or longer., Stand with your hips and knees apart, your arms out, back straight, and abs tight. Bend your knees and hips, slowly lowering yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Rise back up slowly, squeezing the muscles in your backside. Repeat the desired number of times., Those who do tai-chi have incredible strength and balance. Do an Internet search to find a class in your area, or look for a personal instructor. Focus on your breathing and balance while following along with the moves., Ballet dancers also have amazing balance. Find online tutorials and videos, or sign up for a ballet class. Not only will you improve your balance, you\u2019ll also increase your flexibility and learn new moves., You should be facing forward, with your arms at your sides. If you are attempting the scorpion for the first time, you may want to have a spotter there to assist you, or stand near a dresser or other flat, stable surface you can use for balance., Bend your leg backward at the knee so that you can reach your foot. Use the hand on the same side of your body to grip your foot (e.g., if you are bending your left leg, grip it with your left hand). Keep the knee on your other leg locked for stability., Use your leg muscles to stretch your leg as high as it will go behind you. Don\u2019t use your hand to pull your muscles, just use it to guide your foot into the correct position., As your leg raises higher, turn the elbow on the hand gripping your foot outward so that it points forward, in front of your head., Reach behind you and grab your foot with your other hand, so that both hands are now holding your foot. Your elbows should be above your head, pointing in front of you., Try to push your leg as high as it will go. This is the scorpion.\n\n, If you can\u2019t quite reach your toes yet, use a sports band to help you stretch. Hold the band in both hands behind your legs like you would with a skipping rope. Put the band around the top of one foot (near your toes) and pull your leg up behind you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119079}
{"text":" Warming up beforehand is a \"very\" important step. If you don't warm up you could easily tear a muscle, which could put you off your schedule to get your bow and arrow for days or even weeks! Think of your muscles as a rubber band. If the rubber band is warm and flexible, it becomes easier to stretch. You can stretch it further and longer and has better elasticity. But if you pop the rubber band in the freezer, making it cold, and then take it out and try to stretch it, it will snap clear in half because it has become brittle (just like your muscles can). To avoid this problem, warm up those rubber band muscles by simply jogging in place for 60 seconds. Or you can do these stretches immediately after your normal cardio or workout.;\n, Sit in a straddle and put your hands and arms out in front of you. Try to scoot and reach your hands out in front of you as far as you can and try to push your chest and shoulders towards the ground. As you do this, try to keep you feet turned out, knees and toes pointed back (not flexed feet). Don't bend your knees, or else you are not stretching the proper muscles. It is ideal to be flat against the ground, but you won't be able to do that at first. Hold this for 30 seconds, making sure to breath deeply to get oxygen to those muscles! You also want to go over and hold 30 seconds each leg and also put your nose to your knee for 30 seconds each leg.\n\n, Hold a runner's lunge for 30-60 seconds on each leg, pushing your hips toward the floor and making sure your knee does not pass your toes on the leg in front (make sure the leg in font stays at a 90 degree angle). Now slide into your splits. Note: even if you don't have them to the floor, just stay in them! It does hurt, but just tough it out for 30 seconds.\n\n, If you cannot yet reach your leg, tie a belt\/scarf that you don't mind getting ruined around your foot or ankle and use it to pull your leg towards you. Hold for 45 seconds, each leg. Eventually, you will be able to pull your leg so close to your head that you can use your other hand to hold your foot and then eventually you will be able to push that other arm through the space between your leg and body, and be able to do a perfect bow and arrow!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119080}

For all-star squads, your regulations will be especially important, and will govern practice times and locations, uniform and travel costs, tryout guidelines and eligibility, insurance policies, team fees, community involvement and philanthropy, and discipline.\n\n, It is extremely important that you not mix the squad\u2019s funds with your personal funds.\n\n, For all-star squads, this must be a space with adequate padding for stunting and tumbling practice, as well as a regulation-size floor mat to practice competition routines. For traditional squads, you can likely use your sports team\u2019s gym or practice space- check with your team\u2019s head coach to coordinate times the space will be available for your squad\u2019s practices.\n\n, At a minimum, come up with a quick dance routine that is at least eight 8-counts, and require the performance of one cheer, and couple of jumps.

You will need moisturizer with SPF (If you practice outside), chap-stick, and if you want, you can add a little concealer.\n\n, Always wear sports bras (some girls only wear the bra because you can get hot), and if you would like to add a tee-shirt, or a sport shirt, that's fine too. Don't forget to wear deodorant. Many girls prefer something made for movement or sports.\n\n, Try a comfortable pair of shorts, like Soffe's for an example, with a pair of bloomies or spankies underneath. The reason girls wear bloomies and spankies is so that when they fly, no one can see their underwear. Another plus lots of girls carry around is lotion to keep their legs from looking dry.\n\n, If you really want to wear tennis-shoes to practice, you can though.

{"text":" This is the most vital step in maintaining your flexibility. You should spend approximately ten to fifteen minutes multiple times a week stretching, holding each position for about thirty seconds. Do not rush through stretching simply because you cannot be bothered as if you do not stretch properly and injure yourself, it will prohibit you from being able to work on your cheerleading over the break altogether. Try some of these simple yet effective stretching positions.\n\n\nPike stretch. This stretch will stretch your hamstrings and your calves, two very important muscles needed in cheerleading, especially when performing jumps. To stretch your pike, sit up straight on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you. Gently bend over, reaching your arms to your toes, and try to get your nose to touch your knees for a better stretch. Be sure to keep your feet flat and your toes pointing to the ceiling.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLunge Stretch. A lunge stretch is a good way to stretch out your splits. Go into a kneeling \"proposal\" position on the ground with one knee pointing to the ceiling and the other on the ground. Without moving your front knee in front of your front toe, stretch out your back leg as far as you can. Be sure to keep your back upright. Hold for thirty seconds and switch sides so your other leg is on the front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Butterfly Stretch. Sitting on the ground, bend your knees in so the bottom of your feet are touching each other in front of you. try to move your feet closer to your body and lean forward so your nose is touching your feet. Also try to push your knees so they are flat on the ground. Hold for thirty seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bridge. To do a bridge from the ground, lay down on your back with your knees pointed to the ceiling. Make sure your feet are flat on the ground. Place your hands so they are in line with your ears and so your fingers are pointing the same way as your toes and push up. To do a bridge position from standing, you must have a pretty solid bridge on the ground. Keep your arms locked and by your ears. Watch your hands as you push your hips forward and bend your knees and fall back into your bridge. Performing a bridge from standing is called a Backbend. Always use a spotter if you have never performed a backbend before. A backbend (or bridge) stretches out your back. Bridges can be tough to hold, so try to hold one for as long as you can (even if that is only ten seconds).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quad Stretch. The quad stretch is also an important stretch. It stretches your quad (or thigh) muscles. To achieve a quad stretch, stand on your right leg and lift up your left foot so your left knee is pointing towards the ground. Grab your left foot with your left hand and pull your foot towards your bottom. Hold for thirty seconds and then switch so you are standing on your left leg and lifting up your right foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStretching the shoulder and arm muscles. These are important especially during tumbling as they are the things holding up your body. To stretch your shoulders, bend both your elbows in front of you so your forearms are parallel to each other. Then, move both your arms to they are on either side of you. Place each arm against a wall. A door frame or hallway is ideal for this stretch. Then, push forward on your chest. To stretch your wrists, extend one arm out in front of your body so the palm of your hand is facing away from you. With your other hand, gently pull back on your fingers. Hold for thirty seconds and then switch arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, If you do not practice your tumbling over a long period of time, chances are when you need to tumble again next season you will chicken out of it. Practice on a safe, stable trampoline (preferably one with a safety net around it). If you haven't mastered a move yet, use a spotter for assistance. Practice:\n\n\nBack handsprings\nBack walkovers\nFront handsprings\nFront walkovers\nBack tucks\nLayouts\n\n, There are many great cheer camps that take course over the summer holidays. These are the perfect opportunity to meet new friends, gain flexibility and learn many new tumbling, stunting and dance moves. Search online or phone up your local gym to see if they have anything going these holidays.\n\n, This is the perfect time to excel at something in cheerleading you don't have completely down pat. If you're not flat in your splits, stretch daily and try to make it all the way to the floor. If you can do a split on only one leg, stretch out the other leg! If you can do a standing back bend but can't kick over, search up youtube videos to help you. Get your toe touch that much higher and practice it daily on the ground and on the trampoline! There are many simple things you could do at home which could improve yourself for next season - and who knows, maybe your hard work on your toe touches or your tumbling could score you a front-row position in your next routine!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119084}
{"text":" It\u2019s a fairly obvious point, but if you want to reduce your waist size, you need to reduce the amount of calories you consume. Weight loss is an obvious equation: You need to burn more than you take in, and exercise burns fewer calories than many people think.\n\n\nIt takes a caloric deficit of 3,500 to lose a single pound. Many studies have found that if you keep a food diary in which you list what you eat every day, with the number of calories consumed, you will be more likely to eat less.\nUse online calorie counters to figure out the number of calories in everything you eat. Pay careful attention to condiments, like salad dressing, that might contain more calories than you think. Even eating 100 fewer calories per day will make a difference over time .\n\nRunning is a great way to burn calories. Try to work toward running for 30 minutes at least three times a week. You can alternate walking and running until you\u2019re stronger. If you could jog 20 miles per week, you could lose a lot of belly fat in 6 months time. ;\n, You will eat less if you eat protein-heavy meals because they make you feel fuller. You should make sure you eat a high-protein breakfast, especially. Don\u2019t skip breakfast. You could increase your weight loss rate by 25 percent if you switch to a high-protein diet.\n\n\nRemember that 80 percent of losing weight (including around your waist) needs to come from diet, not exercise. Eggs, tuna fish, vegetables, salads, almonds, apples, and lean meats are good choices. If you find it hard to clean up your diet, remember that having a waist over 34.5 inches means you\u2019re at higher risk for a series of ailments, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. And you simply will not shrink your waist dramatically without a decent diet. Try to limit how much dairy you eat. Foods that you should fill your diet with include skinless chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. These are good for the waist.\nIf you can pull it off, try to eat at least one-third of your overall diet raw.\n\n, The problem with starches and sugar is that they raise the levels of insulin production. This hormone is associated with larger waist size. So you need to weed starch and sugar out of your diet. Avoid refined carbohydrates (foods made out of white flour won't help your waist).\n\n\nBe aware that high sugar foods can contribute to belly bloat, and some of them are foods you might assume are healthy, like beans, potatoes, and bananas.\nThe other problem with sugar and starch is that you will end up with high calories and less satisfaction. These are basically empty calories with little nutritional value. Examples include doughnuts, French fries, and white bread.\nLook at labels, and weed fructose out of your diet. Fructose makes it a lot harder to lose weight. It\u2019s found in a lot of processed foods and drinks, and you should limit your intake of it to less than 15 grams per day. Some foods that are considered healthy but have a lot of fructose in them can include enhanced water, yogurt, and some foods labeled as diet foods.\n\n, Even if the carbonated drink you typically reach for is a diet version, it can be problematic for your waist size.\n\n\nFizzy drinks increase the amount of gas in your intestinal system. In addition, some diet drinks contain sweeteners which the body has trouble breaking down. Both of these things contribute to larger waist size.\nInstead, drink water (you need to drink water throughout the day, as it will also increase your metabolism). And try drinking peppermint tea. If you must drink alcohol, red wine in moderation is a better choice than beer.\nAnother reason to drink more water is because people often mistake dehydration for hunger. So, if you feel hungry, try guzzling a bottle of water instead. , There are many reasons to eat coconut oil. One of them is because it burns abdominal fat, as well as boosting your metabolism.\n\n\nCoconut oil contains acid that makes the body feel more full. So studies have found that people ate fewer calories when they started eating coconut oil daily. Coconut oil metabolizes very fast in your body. Some studies have found that coconut oil reduces the size of the waist and belly fat. ","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119085}
{"text":" Make sure most of you have experience in cheerleading and\/or gymnastics. If none of you do, teach yourself some basics and enroll in a gymnastics class. Gymnastics is a must. You all must be able to do a cartwheel, round off, handstand, and split before you even start doing cheernastics. Cheerleading is the easy part, no need for spotters to do some jumps, kicks, and arm motions. For gymnastics, it gets tougher with tumbling, stunts, and extreme moves. So, if you want to do cheernastics, gymnastics is a must unless you are on a school or all star cheerleading squad. On school squads, you won't learn much tumbling, but they may teach you back handsprings, handstands, cartwheels, and round offs. You can teach yourself back bends, walkovers, and the Valdez. Save the tucks, aerials, and flips for gymnastics class.\n\n, You can use your own pom-poms and megaphones if you have any. Your outfit should be dance shorts, a tank top or top with your squad logo, cheer shoes or white tennis shoes, and a hair bow.\n\n, Choose cute and cool color combinations that are cute and awesome together. They need to go well together and everybody on your Cheernastics squad should have those colors. These will be the colors of your outfit. For example, if your squad colors are purple and white, wear white dance shorts and a purple and white striped shirt. Your hair bow should also be that color. Or, do your school colors in case you want to try out for your school squad after this.\n\n, Your name should be something that is fun, original, and short. It can be something like \"Tumbling Trio\", \"Dancing Divas\", or anything you like. Your logo should have and abbreviation of your squad name. If your name is Fly Gals, your logo can be a flyer and say FG. You can do whatever you want as long as it is cheer related. Don't go by your school team name, as this is a little corny.\n\n, Go on YouTube and learn a few by heart. Or, make your own cheers. Remember to add a chant to them. You should also learn a few dances. Practice them together everyday until you have them down pat. Improve your cheers by keeping stiff motions. Improve your chants with a loud and clear voice. Improve your dance by flowing with the music and letting go. You should really focus on jazz, hip hop, and modern dancing. You can find free videos on Activity TV and YouTube. You can also learn some cheerleading motions and routines.\n\n, Motions include: bow and arrow, daggers, punch, hands on hips, L, K, T, broken T, touchdown, low touchdown, high and low V, diagonals, buckets, and candlesticks. Jumps include: toe touch, herkie, hurdler, pike, spread eagle, tuck, T, around the world, abstract, and many others. Kicks include: front, 45 degree, and side. Cheerleading tumbling includes: back handspring, front tuck, back tuck, aerial, cartwheel, round off, handstand, front handspring, back bend, rolls, walkover, among others.\n\n, You all need to be in an oversplit, be good at gymnastics, have wonderful endurance, and be strong. So, you need to stretch 4 times a day, take a gymnastics class once a week, run 3 days a week, and do strength training 3 days a week. If none of you take gymnastics, you will have to look up ways to train for tumbling moves, but never attempt them without a coach and\/or spotter. Practice gymnastics everyday.\n\n, If you win make your team something cool or go do something fun together. Example gifts include shirts with your team name, emergency cheer kit, a makeup kit, and stuffed animals of your mascot. Things to do together can be a movie, lunch, sleepover, or hanging out in the park.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119086}

Get advice from a product consultant at a beauty supply store or research online reviews to choose a moisturizer that is right for your skin. Look for ingredients that target you specific skin type, such as:Ceramides, glycerin, and mineral oil for dry skin\nLavender oil, rose oil, or green tea extract for sensitive skin\nHyaluronic acid or glycerin for oily or combination skin\n\n, Retinoids, derivatives of vitamin A, increase your skin' s production of collagen and regulate skin cells, leaving skin looking more youthful. Buy a mild retinoid cream from a department store or beauty supply store, or visit a dermatologist to get a prescription for a stronger retinoid treatment. Prescription retinoids may be rougher on skin for the first few weeks of use (e.g., causing redness or peeling skin), but will ultimately produce faster and more noticeable results.Ease into using retinoid creams or lotions by applying a pea-sized amount at night for 2-3 nights before using it as you normally would a day or night moisturizer.

{"text":" Use exfoliating shower gel to clean off the grime. Turn the water to hot to start the shower (because it cleans you more effectively), but towards the end of your shower, turn the water to a lukewarm or cool setting. This lowers your body temperature to make you feel cooler (and wakes you right up in the morning!).;\n, A great trick is to use baby oil instead of the normal lotions. While you're still damp, rub small amounts all over your body. If you prefer scented lotions, use something light. Opt towards citrus or flowers for a nice crisp scent. Heavy scents like Vanilla or Coconut can make you feel warm. Bath and Body works has lots of nice scents (Sweet Pea and Cucumber Melon are ideal for summer), and they usually have coupons and sales.\n\n, Sweat and oil can accumulate and clog your pores, making your face feel dirty and heavy. A good exfoliating cream and a light moisturizer should do the trick\n\n, Ponytails always work. Be sure to wash your hair at least once a week (or however often you need to for your hair type) to keep your scalp clean and healthy.\n\n, You should do this at least twice a day anyway. A fresh, clean mouth can make your tongue feel cooler. Minty toothpastes and gum are good to use during the summer to help you feel cool.\n\n, Remember: the lighter the color the less heat it attracts, so try to choose brighter colors like white, pink, yellow and orange. The weight of the fabric is also important to consider, so silk shirts will keep you cooler than denim.\n\n, When doing outdoor sports\/activities, bring plenty of cold water or Gatorade and try to stay in the shade as much as possible. A small fan or a spray bottle can help you avoid heat exhaustion too, if you want.\n\n, The water and vitamins in fruit will treat you much better than the sodium in those savory treats.\n\n, This can make your house feel several degrees cooler and help you avoid turning on the air conditioner, which draws a lot of power.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119088}

If the lip liner is darker, it will smudge and look harsh, plus it'll make your lips look smaller. If it's lighter, then it'll probably look unfinished.\n\n\nLine the very edge of your lips starting with the Cupid's bow and fill your lips completely; that way, if the top lip product rubs off, there won't just be a line surrounding your lips.\n\n, After adding your lip liner, you'll usually apply a layer of lipstick. Lipsticks come in various finishes. The finishes include: Matte (no shine), glossy (color or glitter layer with shine), satin\/cream (moist full-coverage), frosty (shiny and metallic pigmentation), and sheer (little pigmentation).\n\n\nThe right lipstick finish for your lips depends on whether your lips are dry or not. If you have dry lips, the best lipstick finish for you would be a glossier formula. If you have normal lips you could go for a more matte finish, since that formula tends to be more drying. If you're somewhere in between, a satin\/cream finish might be a good choice.\nIf you aren't sure what colors would suit\u00a0your skin tone best, you need to know what undertones you have. Warm undertones look best with orange undertone lipsticks, and cool undertones look best with blue undertoned ones with respect to red lipsticks. Usually you can tell which lipsticks look good with your skin by swatching them on your hand.\nWarm goes with warm, cool goes with cool. If you aren't sure what undertone you have, you can check simply by looking at the veins on the underside of your wrist.\u00a0Cool undertones- blue or purple veins; warm undertones- green or olive veins; neutral undertones- blue-green veins.\n\n, Lip gloss is pretty simple. You can choose a color that matches your lipstick, or a clear one to make any lipstick glossy. You can even wear it by itself. If you want to mattify any lipstick, just put a little translucent powder on your finger and pat it on until the powder is undetectable.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119091}
{"text":" Much of the food in grocery stores and fast food restaurants is highly processed to make it cheaper to produce and extend its shelf life. This processing often cuts out essential nutrients, and changes the food composition in ways that make you get fat.\n\n\nStick to the outside aisles at the grocery store. An easy way to eat better is to shop on the outside aisles, where the fresh foods are kept, and avoid the shelves in the middle where everything is preserved and processed.\nLearn to read food labels. Reading the small print on food packaging will help you tell the difference between food that is really good for you and clever food marketing. A lot of \"healthy\" food products make claims that are deliberately misleading in order to trick consumers into buying them.\n\nCheck the serving size. Sometimes foods will advertise being low in fat or sugar, and the numbers in the nutritional guide will appear low, but the serving size will be far smaller than a normal serving.\nLook at the overall healthfulness of the food, not just an isolated health claim. Many foods claim to be high in fiber, but are also extremely high in sugar and other refined carbohydrates. This makes the food fattening even if it is advertised as healthy.\n\n;\n, Again, these have very low nutritional value, and and have a lot of calories packed into small serving sizes.\n\n\nBe especially wary of refined carbohydrates. These are notorious for causing obesity. Anything that contains flour or sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose) is going to be stored in your body as fat.\n\nRefined carbohydrates can also trigger changes in your body that make your metabolism less efficient.\nSugar can also cause cravings that make you want even more of it later.\n\n\nMake water your drink of choice. It contains no calories, aids digestion, and can also help flush metabolism-slowing toxins from your system.\n\nSugary drinks, such as soda or even fruit juice contain a lot of carbohydrates, and therefore add to weight gain.\nDiet sodas, though they claim to contain few or no calories, have sweeteners in them that also promote weight gain, and are possibly toxic. , Getting up to 40% of one\u2019s calories from healthy sources of fat is acceptable, especially if this is replacing refined carbohydrates in your diet.This contrasts from the low-fat diets of the 80's and 90's, many of which have been proven ineffective.\n\n\nBeware of products that are low-fat. Just because something is low in fat, it doesn't mean it's not fattening. Lots of low fat products are loaded with sugar and other refined carbohydrates that will turn into fat in your body once you eat them.\nAvoid trans fats. Trans fats such as hydrogenated oils are made by manipulating the chemical structure of natural oils and turning them into something that is completely alien to your body. These not only cause weight gain, but are also implicated in illnesses like heart disease.Limit saturated fat to no more than 10% of your daily food consumption. Recent research has shown that saturated fats such as those found in butter and red meat are not as bad as previously thought, but most mainstream nutritional guides suggest that it may raise LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol levels., The worst thing you can do for your motivation is to feel like you're depriving yourself. Feeling deprived can make you feel anxious, and this can drive you to wards unconscious eating.Don't starve yourself! There are plenty of health risks to not eating regular meals. Furthermore, if your body doesn't get enough to eat, the body prepares to survive what it thinks is a famine by going into \"starvation mode\" and storing extra fat.\nAt first, add, rather than subtract food to your diet, and figure out what you like. Don't just focus on cutting out unhealthy foods. Find some new, healthy foods to try to start adding them to your eating routines. These foods will replace less healthy foods little by little until your overall food intake is a lot healthier.\n\n, Just understand that you're going to have to be creative about sticking to your diet, even if your willpower fails.\n\n\nThe impulse to eat is vital to survival, and throughout most of human history, the main problem has been getting enough to eat. Our brains and bodies have not yet adjusted to the modern surplus of food.\nSalt, sugar, and fat (and all the tasty, modern combinations of the three) are things that our bodies are designed to crave. Again, these were once scarce yet essential nutrients, so in many ways we are \"programmed\" to look for them. , We are faced with an overwhelming number of food decisions every day, so it helps to make healthy food the easiest option. Set up routines with your eating, and have healthy food accessible to you at all times.\n\n\nHave some standby snacks ready, such as nuts, carrot sticks or fruit for when you get hungry, and make them easier to access than the processed stuff (better still, make healthy food the only food in your house!).\nHave some healthy meals you can eat \"by default\" when you're not feeling too picky about what to eat, or when you need something quick and convenient. Instead of stocking up on instant noodles and PB&J, keep salad fixings or veggie casseroles on hand.\n\n, Measure your waistline periodically, or get your body fat measured. Just the act of measuring your body is correlated to losing weight.Keeping track of the results of your diet can be a great motivator.\nRemember that weight fluctuates a little each day, so don't get discouraged if the weight on your bathroom scale unexpectedly goes up a bit.\n\n, Research has shown that being sleepy can cause you to overeat. When you're sleepy you often go on autopilot, and might find that you have a much harder time making good decisions., Because of the way the brain processes visual information, the size of your dishes can affect how you decide how much food you're going to need to feel satisfied.If your plates are a lot bigger than your food, you'll feel it isn't enough. Using smaller plates will require less food to make them appear full.\nSmall, skinny glasses appear to hold more liquid than short, wide ones, even if they have the same volume. Use this optical illusion when you're drinking sweet drinks you want to limit.\n\n, Most people's tendency is to finish whatever is put in front of them, even if they are already full, and food manufacturers know that people will buy and eat more if they are presented with bigger packages.\n\n\nDon't sit down with a huge bag of potato chips. Put a few in a bowl and stop when the bowl is empty.\nRepack mini portions of any snacks you buy in bulk.\n\n, If you put your unhealthy favorites where they are harder to reach, you're much less likely to eat them without thinking. Even just taking things off your desk and putting them on the other side of the room can make a big difference., When people eat socially, they often take cues from their companions about how much to eat. If there are people around you that eat a lot, try taking meals with people that eat less.\n\n\nIf this is impossible or unpleasant, at least be aware of this tendency and notice how other people's eating affects you.\nIf you tend to eat more when you're alone, try eating more meals around other people and see if this helps., If you're distracted while eating meals, because you're eating in front of the TV or while driving, you're far less likely to notice that you feel full or how much you have eaten. Be conscious of what you're eating and pay attention to the feelings in your body that tell you when you feel full, and you will eat less.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119092}
{"text":" The procedure will start with the doctor using a deep cleaning gel or foam to remove any make up, dust, or natural oils from your skin.A device will be applied to your face to abrade the uppermost layer of skin, i.e. rubbing it away via friction. This takes 30 \u2013\u00a040 minutes for the face and about 20 minutes for the neck. Afterwards, a moisturize will be applied.There are two types of device:The more common has a tip that shoots out tiny, rough aluminum oxide crystals that abrade your face before being vacuumed back up along with dead skin cells. It works something like a miniature sandblaster.\nThe other type has an applicator that applies a fine diamond tip to scrape the skin from your face before the dead cells are sucked up in a vacuum.;\n, Microdermabrasion is gentle, non-invasive, and proven to make skin look younger and smoother. It can be used to treat a dull complexion, uneven skin tone or texture, age spots, acne scars, sun-damaged skin and wrinkles,though it has limited effectiveness in combating serious acne or hyperpigmentation (patches of dark skin).You may not be a good candidate for microdermabrasion if you have:Active rosacea\nFragile capillaries or vascular lesions (appearing as red splotches on the skin)\nActive acne\nWarts\nEczema\nDermatitis\nOpen sores\nPsoriasis (patches of thick, scaly skin)\nLupus\nUncontrolled diabetes\n\n, The average cost of a procedure in the United States is $143,but it may be as low as $15 \u2013\u00a0$40 in India and other Asian countries.Multiple sessions \u2014 usually between 5 and 16 \u2014 are required to achieve desired results.Many doctors offer financing plans to make the treatment more affordable for their patients.\n\n, Microdermabrasion is performed by plastic surgeons and dermatologists, and also in spas and salons. Aestheticians at spas and salons may perform effective microdermabrasion, but these providers are unregulated, so you will minimize your risks by choosing a doctor.Doctors can examine your skin to be sure that microdermabrasion is safe for you. To pick a doctor:Talk to your friends. A referral is the best way to find a good clinic.\nAsk your physician for a recommendation.\nRead online reviews, but be careful. Reviews may be posted by clinic employees.\n\n, You should have a consultation before scheduling your procedure to make sure you are comfortable with the facility, that microdermabrasion is safe for you, and to ask the doctor any questions you might have, such as:Are you certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Board of Dermatology?\nHow many treatments will be needed?\nWhat are the possible side effects?\nIs the procedure safe for me?\nDo you have any before-and-after photos?\nHow much will it cost? Do you have payment plans?\n\n, Tretinoin (Atralin, Refissa, Tretin-X) is used to treat severe acne. Use results in an increased risk of scarring after microdermabrasion treatment. You will need to wait at least six months after your last usage before undergoing microdermabrasion., Some physicians ask patients to use a special type of skincare product prior to microdermabrasion to ensure the surface of the dermis is in top condition at the time of the treatment. These solutions are often available through the doctor's office where the procedure is performed. If not, be sure to fill your prescription early so that you can start using the solution on time.\n\n, Because microdermabrasion works by peeling away a layer of skin, any treatments that leave your skin more sensitive can lead to discomfort or other complications. Be sure to discuss any treatments you may have recently had with your doctor.Treatments to avoid include:\n\n\nFacials\nWaxing\nTweezing\nElectrolysis\nLaser treatments\nInjections of collagen or BOTOX\nChemical peels\n\n, Sun can damage your skin and make it more sensitive, so you\u2019ll want to avoid sun exposure as much as possible, especially in the week before your treatment.Even when not preparing for microdermabrasion, you should always apply sunscreen when going outside for more than a few minutes, even on overcast days.\n\n, You want your skin as healthy as possible before the treatment, and cigarette smoke inhibits blood circulation in the skin. You\u2019ll want to stop smoking for at least the week before your procedure, and for better, long-lasting results and healthy skin (not to mention a reduced risk of cancer), you should stop smoking altogether., If the drugs are over the counter, simply stop. If they are prescribed, consult your doctor first. These anti-inflammatories increase the risk of bleeding or facial rashes as a result of the procedure.NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories) include:Aspirin\nIbuprofen (Motrin, Advil)\nNaproxen (Aleve)\nCelecoxib (Celebrex)\nDiclofenac (Cambia, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR, Zipsor, Zorvolex)\nMefenamic acid (Ponstel)\nIndomethacin (Indocin)\nOxaprozin (Daypro)\nAnd the following: aceclofenac, etodolac, etoricoxib, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, ketorolac, meclofenamate, meloxicam, nabumetone, piroxicam, sulindac, and tolmetin.\n\n, Most topical medications use acids to peel away outer layers of skin. They will leave your skin more sensitive, leading to potential discomfort.Discuss any products you are using with your doctor before microdermabrasion. Do not use:\n\n\nAlpha hydroxy acid products containing glycolic or lactic acid\nSalicylic acid products\nRetinoids (Retin A, Renova, Differin, Tazorac)\nBenzoyl peroxide\n\n, Microdermabrasion can occasionally lead to a reoccurrence. To avoid this your doctor can prescribe antiviral medication to take before your treatment., Instead of soap, use a syndet bar (a cleaner that uses a synthetic detergent) or a lipid-free cleaner to clean your face and neck.These cleaners help to preserve moisture in your face much better than soap. Look for cleaners that contain glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, sodium laurel, or sulfate., To avoid possible adverse effects, you want your skin to be as healthy as possible going into the treatment.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119093}
{"text":" Shut and lock all the doors and windows in the room that you'll be staying in. Especially at night, pull the shades or blinds. Put a towel or blanket along the bottom of your door if there is a gap between it and the floor. You want complete privacy with no interference. It's common courtesy for people in nudist clubs to bring their own towels to sit on, so you can start this practice in your own room.\n\n\nMake sure that you have plenty of things to do, and that you can keep to yourself for the period of time that you have in mind.;\n, Put your clothes in a pile in the same order that you'd put them on so you can get dressed if someone comes knocking on your door. If you're really worried about getting caught nude, then you should do this. However, you can also keep a towel around, quickly wrap yourself in it, and claim that you were about to take a shower if someone comes in.\n\n, Now that you've removed any obstacles in your way, as well as your clothes, you can just go about your daily life. So, don't do anything particularly special just because you're in the buff. Real nudists just do what they normally do, only nude -- even if they are able to enjoy life a little more and feel more liberated as a result. Here are some things you can do in your room:\n\n\nHave fun. Read a book, play a computer game, watch TV, draw, paint, play solitaire, do word searches, play guitar, it doesn't matter what you do as long as you are nude while doing it.\nGet down to business. Refine your resume, do computer research, do your taxes, clean your room, organize photos, and so on. Things that might otherwise not be much fun to do (i.e. cleaning) are often much enjoyable to do while nude.\nGet healthy. Moderate exercise, stretching, or yoga is very beneficial while nude, especially in front of a full-length mirror, as one can see which muscles and ligaments come into play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive yourself a self-massage. While you are not able to reach your back, you can massage your legs, arms, torso, feet, hands, stomach, scalp, and other places you can relieve tension.\nPamper yourself. While nude with an extended amount of time at your disposal, it is a good time to apply moisturizing lotion all over your body as you relax on a blanket.\nBe bold. Call a friend on the phone and talk in the nude with your friend being none the wiser. See how it feels to interact on a platonic level with a friend without having any clothes on. If you feel perfectly comfortable, you may want to join a nudist group in the future, when you're ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow that it's not about the sexy stuff. Though you may be tempted to touch yourself while you're in the nude, which is, of course, perfectly natural, remember that one of the core principles of nudism is that it is practiced in a non-sexual manner. That is why it is important to have as many other things to fill your time as possible once you shut your door.\n\n, Many people sleep naked just because they think it feels good, even if they don't consider themselves nudists. If you're serious about practicing nudism alone in your room, then a great way to do it is to go to bed naked; if you're caught, people won't think it's too strange, because plenty of people do it. Keep a bathrobe handy if you have to get up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. If you're serious about nudism, you can just wake up in the morning and continue to be nude for as long as it's possible.\n\n, Another great thing to do while you're all alone in your room is to research nudism online. You should have a firm understanding of what you're really doing if you want to truly practice nudism. There are many misconceptions about nudism that you need to be aware of before you can say you truly understand it. Here are some things you may learn:Many nudists actually prefer to be called naturists.\nNudism isn't meant to be sexual. Being naked is meant to be perfectly natural instead of causing arousal.\nNudism is about gaining back the freedom little kids feel about being nude. You have to stop thinking about the restrictions that society has placed on you and return you your inner child. Nudism is playful.\nNudism is also called naturism because it's all about returning to your natural state.\nWhile it's illegal to be nude in a public place, the practice of nudism as a whole is not illegal, unless you're living in Arkansas, Saudi Arabia, Iran, or a few other locations.\nNudism is not sexually deviant. Nudists have perfectly healthy sex lives; they just don't make their daily lifestyle any more sexual just because they aren't wearing clothes. Nor does this mean that they are asexual. Being part of a nudist group does not mean that you have to be overly sexual just because you're in the buff.\nYou don't have to have a perfect body to be a nudist. You just have to be comfortable with what you've got.\nYou don't have to be naked all the time to be a nudist, either. Many nudists hold regular jobs and wear regular clothes when they \"have to,\" though they are always looking for opportunities to be nude and express themselves.\n\n, Unfortunately, you can't be naked in your room forever. Whether you're meeting friends at the movies or having a family dinner, it's time to put those clothes back on and to go out into the world. If you really are starting to feel restricted doing this and can't bear to be walking around with your clothes on all day, then you can start thinking about taking your nudism to the next level.\n\n, Once you're fully comfortable practicing nudism in the comfort of your own room, you can take it to the next level. If you just want to do it in your room, then chances are it's because you live with roommates or family members who may not be super understanding of your lifestyle. If that's the case, then either you talk to them about it or see how they react (the harder option), or just start exploring other rooms in the house when you know nobody is home.\n\n\nStart by just going in the buff from your room to the bathroom before and after a shower. Then, try going to another room naked, even if only for a few minutes.\nWhen you know no one will be home for a few hours, you can shut the blinds, and have fun hanging out all over the house in the buff.\nJust make sure to have a back up plan in case people come home earlier than you expected (if you really care about explaining why you're watching TV in the buff.)\nYou can always keep a towel around to cover yourself up and say you were just getting into the shower. However, if you really believe in nudism, then you don't want to be sneaking around forever, do you?\n\n, Once you've mastered being nude at home, you can take it a step further. If you live in a relatively secluded area, or near one, then see how good it feels to get nude in your backyard, in the woods behind your house, or even on a deserted beach nearby. Just be prepared for the reactions of people who may see you and could get the wrong impression, and try to do it in a place that is as isolated as possible. For example, you can go on a little hike into a deserted wooded area or swim out to a secluded part of a lake, and then go commando.\n\n\nSee how it feels to be so close to the elements. Is this something you'd like to do more long term, and without feeling like you're sneaking around?\n\n, If you've liked the freedom and liberation you've felt from going in the nude, then you may want to have a conversation with your loved ones about it. Talk to your best friend, your boyfriend, or even your parents, if you feel that this desire has become an essential part of you that people should know about. Be prepared for people not to understand what nudism is all about and to be a little bit skeptical or judgmental, at first. But don't worry -- they'll come around. And if they don't, you'll find a way to manage.\n\n, If you feel good about being a nudist, then you can take your interest to the next level by jointing AANR (American Association for Nude Recreation) or a similar league for people who are interested in maintaining their rights to be nude and to know where they can go to safely practice nudism.This organization as well as others can help you find clubs where you can practice your nudism, whether you're meeting at a private residence or a health club.\n\n\nYou can also look out for nudist beaches or resorts, whether you're in the USA, France, or other nudist-friendly locations.\nDon't be afraid. If you find the right home, you won't be entering into a overly-sexualized, predatory environment. Make sure you look into the ideals of the group you want to join before you take the plunge. Nude recreation is supposed to be about acceptance of the self and respecting your individuality as well as the freedom of others, and feeling liberated, not uncomfortable., If you're not quite comfortable with the idea of going in the buff in the place where you currently live, consider branching out by finding resorts that are nude-only. You can use a regular vacation search website and hone your search to \"nudist spa vacations\" to find a resort that is perfect for you, whether you're looking in Mexico or the California hills.This can be a great way to immerse yourself in the life of nudism without feeling like you'll run in to your mom or your fourth grade teacher., Public nudism isn't for everyone. If you just want to stick to being nude in your room or your house, then there's nothing wrong with keeping it that way. You don't have to be nude outside, in public, or around a bunch of other nudists. It's all about expressing your mind and body in the way that makes you happy. So enjoy being nude -- wherever you're doing it!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119094}
{"text":" You will want to spin the ball on the bottom middle of the ball where all of the grooves meet in a perpendicular point. If you spin the ball with the grooves in a horizontal position, your spin won't look as clean and your finger won't have a point to rest on.;\n, Some people will prefer to use two hands to throw and guide the ball into the air before catching it with their finger. Others prefer to palm the basketball in one hand and use a quick flick of the wrist to prop the ball up to the fingertip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You want your elbow to be at a comfortable height, usually a little bit higher than your hip. The ball should be about level with your face when you spin it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This should be the same hand that you will use to spin the ball. Do not hold the ball entirely flat on your palm, as this causes the ball to slide around too easily. Instead grip it with your fingertips and allow for a small air pocket between your palm and the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, By the time you finish the twist of your wrist, your hand will have made a 180-degree twist and your fingertips will be pointing away from your body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You want your thumb to be directly in the middle between the top and the bottom of the ball because it will provide the majority of the force as you toss the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Simultaneously flick your dominant hand 180-degrees, pinky leading, while flicking your thumb on your non-dominant hand forward to spin the ball. Be sure to complete the two motions at the same time in order to create an equal force on both sides of the ball. Use your finger pads on your dominant hand to guide the ball in the proper direction. If you choose to only use one hand to complete the spin, disregard the non-dominant thumb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You want to get the ball to spin very quickly regardless of whether you are using one or two hands. The toss should not be very high above your dominant fingers and should only float a few inches into the air so that you can quickly place your finger under the ball. If you toss the ball too high it will be very difficult (and somewhat painful) to catch with your finger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe faster the ball spins, the longer you will be able to hold it on your finger.\nBe aware that extremely fast balls are more difficult to balance, however.\n\n, Once you've mastered the speed and height of the ball toss, you should be able to catch the ball on your finger without much difficulty. The closer you can keep your hand to the ball, the easier it will be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You don't want the ball to be floating on its own for very long, so allow your arm to float up and make contact with the bottom of the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Do so slowly in a gradual downward motion until your arm is at a comfortable resting height.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This position will make it easiest to keep the ball in a steady position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The nail allows the ball to spin with less resistance. However, if that position is uncomfortable for you, you can spin the ball on your finger pad instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Gradually learn to create a faster spin by slapping the side of the ball with your non-dominant hand in the same direction that the ball is spinning. At first, slapping the ball will probably cause it to fall off of your finger, but eventually you will be able to slap it without causing it to fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlap the side of the ball in three to four slap increments and make sure not to slap too hard.\nA light, but swift slap should be enough to keep the ball going without disrupting the spin.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119095}
{"text":" Before your first Botox treatment, your doctor may ask you for a thorough medical history along with any history of therapeutic drug use.\n\n\nIt is very important that you answer your doctor\u2019s questions accurately and honestly, as some drugs are not suitable to be taken in conjunction with Botox treatments.\nEven health supplements such as vitamin tablets and fish oils should be brought to your doctor\u2019s attentions, as these can thin the blood and cause more bruising post-treatment.;\n, Specific medication that you may need to stop taking before your Botox treatment include:Painkillers (aspirin, ibuprofen)\nCertain herbal remedies\nAntibiotics\nHeart disease-related drugs\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease drugs\nNeurological disease drugs\nVitamin-mineral supplements\n\n, Your doctor may advise you to stop taking any aspirin-like products for a minimum of 4 days before the procedure.\n\n\nThis is due to the fact that aspirin causes bleeding, as it is an antiplatelet drug that prevents the blood from clotting.\nTaking aspirin before a Botox treatment may cause excessive bleeding during and after the procedure.\n\n, Having alcohol in your system can make bruising and bleeding worse during a Botox procedure, so avoid consuming any alcoholic drinks for at least two days before the treatment.\n\n, These medications will help you manage the pain, headache, and swelling following a Botox treatment. NSAIDs inhibit the body\u2019s production of prostaglandin, the hormone responsible for pain and inflammation. You can take these NSAIDs:\n\n\n\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol). It is available in 200-400mg tablets and you can take it every 4 to 6 hours or as needed for pain management.\n\nIbuprofen (Advil). It is available in 200 to 400mg tablets and you can take it every 4 to 6 hours as needed.\n\n, It\u2019s a good idea to have an ice pack with you that you can use directly after the procedure in order to prevent bruising.\n\n\nBe sure to wrap the ice pack in a cloth or towel to prevent directly damaging your skin. What's more, be sure to keep it on the area for only about 15 minutes, also to prevent damage.\nThe cold from the ice pack constricts the blood vessels underneath the skin, reducing the level of bleeding. The ice pack will also temporarily relieve any pain and inflammation caused by the injection.\n\n, You should arrange for a friend or family member to drive you home following the Botox procedure. Since Botox causes your eyelids to relax and your facial muscles to droop, it may be dangerous for you to drive or operate any kind of machinery for at least 2 to 4 hours following the procedure.\n\n, Avoid strenuous exercise for at least 24 hours following the Botox procedure, as the movement may cause the Botox toxin to spread to other parts of the body. Movement is fine, just make sure it's minimal.\n\n\nIf the Botox spreads to parts of the body it is not supposed to be in, you may experience adverse side effects.\n\n, Symptoms like slight pain, inflammation, bruising, bleeding and drooping eyelids are normal following a Botox procedure. However, there are other, abnormal side effects that should not be experienced after Botox. If any of the follow symptoms occur, contact a medical professional immediately:\n\n\nDifficulty in breathing and swallowing\nSwelling of eyes and unusual eye discharges\nChest pain\nHoarse voice\nSevere muscle weakness\nDrooping of both eyelids and eyebrows\nPresence of muscle weakness in areas that are away from the site of injection\n\n, Botox has several adverse side effects that are completely normal, but can be rather unpleasant. These include:\n\n\nSwelling at the site of injection\nPain and tenderness at the site of injection\nBruising\nDrooping of eyelids\nMuscle weakness\nNausea, vomiting and headaches\nExcessive sweating in your underarms\nDifficulty swallowing\nFlu-like symptoms\n\n, The Botox procedure basically involves having a bacterial toxin injected into your skin. The body will recognize this toxin as a foreign substance and produce an immune response, which results in the symptoms described above.\n\n\nIn some sensitive people, this immune response against the toxin may be severe (a reaction medically known as hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis). However, this is rare and does not occur amongst most patients.Bruising usually occurs in patients with pre-existing blood disorders such as anemia because their blood tends to be thinner which results in a poor healing process and hence more bruising.\n\n, You might have come across this term whilst doing your own research. Basically, Botox is administered at a particular, small, local site which means the effect acts particularly in that place without affecting the surroundings. At least, normally. In some cases, it doesn't.\n\n\nHowever, if you perform any strenuous work or in case of bruising, the toxin might spread to other places around the site of injection which can lead to the spread of the toxin which could paralyze the muscles in unwanted areas leading to effects such as eye drooping.\nThis phenomenon is called the\u201d spread of toxin\u201d effect. It is one of the most common side effects of Botox treatment; however, it is temporary and will usually disappears on its own within a few weeks.\n\n, Botox is generally safe and can be administered to the vast majority of people without any danger of harmful side effects. However, there are some people for whom Botox is not safe. These include:Pregnant and lactating mothers should not take the treatment as it can prove harmful to the baby.\nPeople with a history of neuromuscular diseases are not fit for the treatment as it can actually make their condition even worse, since the whole principle behind Botox is paralysis of muscles.\nPatients with underlying heart diseases or blood disorders are also advised against the treatment as they are more prone to bruising.\nPeople with Botox allergies. Unfortunately, there are no ways to determine whether one is allergic to Botox or not. There are no skin tests or test dose procedures that can satisfactorily determine any presence of allergy to the toxin.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119096}
{"text":" If right handed, when you are about to shoot make sure your right big-toe is aligned with your right elbow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you step out slightly with your stronger foot, remember to bend your knees. Bent knees will help you explode upward, getting more height and a better angle on the basket.;\n,, You are holding the ball incorrectly, if you check after the game and your palm is dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Your weaker hand should stay where it is, floppy and relaxed. You also want to flick your wrist as you release, for backspin, for a nice soft touch (for your shooting hand).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackspin will create more rotation on the ball. If the ball doesn't go in the basket at first, the additional rotation will make it go in.\n\n, A good way to build up muscle in your legs is doing squats and wall sits. If you strengthen your triceps, you don't need to use your legs as much. You should also try doing calf raises\/squats with weights on your shoulders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Work on that one line of sight working away from the basket:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize a line toward the basket and many lines about 1 foot (0.3\u00a0m) apart, horizontally, squaring-up, facing the basket at that angle. These lines go from the basket back down the court to the three point line and will indicate places to stand, each about one foot deeper.\nStanding (set your off-foot, then step into your shot with the shooting foot stepping toward the basket as you extend your arm and release) close to the basket and shooting at least five times (reps\/repetitions). In a different practice session practice dribbling up to a spot, doing a jump-stop and quickly align and shoot. In other sessions practice with a partner who will pass the ball to you, to practice \"catch and shoot\" -- using good form all the time, not flopping\/goofing around (but not stiff, either).\nMove a foot behind that one and shoot five more times, keeping moving back after you finish five reps at each mark. This helps you to gradually learn your own strength, build the muscle memory and your hand-eye coordination for accuracy at longer distances (that's all on one angle). Next take a breather\/water-break and choose another angle to start close up and work outward on that one.\n\n, B.E.E.F:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance. Every good shooter begins with balance, always line your shooting foot up with the basket and be on balance this is the B in BEEF, BALANCE.\nElbow. Keep your forearm straight, in a groove, not wobbling around on each shoot. After you have your balance, have your elbow on your shooting hand line up to make an L right under the ball (when the wrist is raised to near the eye level).\nEyes. Focus on the goal, where you want the ball to hit, basically above the rim, so the ball will go into the goal.\nFollow through. After you release the ball, keep your hand up in the air, as if you were reaching into a cookie jar\/the basket (for a second).\n\nKeeping your eye on the target (the square in the backboard) is an important part of your follow through.\n\n\n\n, This will allow you to have more power in your shot and will enable you to shoot over opponents. Practice the same way each time, until you have this perfected. Naturally, in game situations there will be distractions and obstacles, but practicing shots thousands of reps makes shooting automatic, with consistently good form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Do not rush into your shot unless you have to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You may fake by raising the ball upward, then if that defender leaves his or her feet (jumps), then you'll jump while the defender will be coming down. If you're fouled by the jumping-defender, you go to the foul line and make your best shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Be confident!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119097}
{"text":" The most distinctive thing about Kevin Durant's shooting technique is that he doesn't square up to the basket to take a shot, he instead aligns himself by pointing his hip to the hole. Some analysts believe that squaring up this way can help to take tension away from the neck and shoulders, resulting in a more natural action, though it traditionally isn't the way shooting is taught.;\n, Likewise, Durant's feet aren't aimed at the hoop when he shoots, but turned to approximately 10 on the clock, if the basket is 12. Some other shooters, like Dirk Nowitzki, orient themselves to the basket similarly, lessening the torque on the neck and shoulders and throwing off defenders.\n\n, Durant doesn't jump straight up in the air when he takes a shot. Instead, he sweeps his feet forward and sways his shoulders back, resulting in a high-arcing shot that he's learned to make incredibly accurate. It's not the most technically-perfect form for a shot from long-range, but it has yielded great shooting percentages for KD.\n\n, Unlike Reggie Miller and Kobe, who have strange off-kilter follow-throughs, Durant's shot itself is fairly straightforward and his technique is pure, other than his foot placement. He keeps his elbows in tight, puts his hand in the cookie jar during the follow through, and almost always makes his shot.\n\n, Unlike flashier players like LeBron and Kobe, Kevin Durant's game is basically built around his jump shot, which he earns by making his way to space and passing the ball, not by using step-jukes and other methods of shaking the player. Unlike other tall ballers, Durant also hops on almost every shot, however close he is to the ball, using his good arcing from any distance.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119098}

{"text":" Shooting the reverse layup involves executing swift, sharp drives across the court to the opposite side of the basket. This kind of activity can easily strain muscles in your legs. To prevent this, you should warm up before attempting the reverse layup. To warm up, you might:Do some light stretching. Touch your toes. Brace yourself against a wall and incline each foot, one at a time, to stretch your calves, and so on, until your muscles are warmed up.\nDo some light calisthenics, like lunges, jumping jacks, a few laps around the court, or other kinds of light aerobic exercise.;\n, Technically, it's possible to perform a reverse layup at a closer distance. However, for the purpose of mastering the mechanics of this technique, you should begin your approach for this shot outside the key.\n\n\nThere are many angles of attack you could use for the reverse layup, but all traditional ones drive from either side of the free throw lane to the opposite side of the basket.\nTrue beginners can locate the key on the court by looking for the keyhole shape formed by the paint of the free throw lane and the semicircle at the top of that lane., If a defender sees you coming, they might block you from cutting to their inside (towards the basket) and crossing to the opposite side of the hoop. Try to create enough space between you and the defender that you have a clean route to drive to the baseline.\n\n\nThe baseline is the boundary line for either side of the court directly underneath the basket of each time.\nWhile approaching the basket for your reverse layup, you might juke to the outside (away from the basket) to throw off the defender, then cut hard to their inside to the opposite side of the basket., Now that you've created space enough for your approach, drive to the baseline of the opposite side of the basket. When you are about two steps from the opposite side of the rim, you'll need to take hold of the ball and prepare to make the shot.\n\n\nYou may have to adjust to defense while taking this shot. This may mean that you have to begin the jump for your reverse layup a step early or late and adjust accordingly.\n\n, As you cut across the free throw lane to the baseline, one side of your leg will face inside (toward the basket), and the other outside (toward the court). Drive downward off your inside leg and jump toward the opposite side of the rim.\n\n\nThe reverse layup can be shot from either side of the free throw lane. No matter which side you approach from, always jump off your inside leg.\nWhen jumping, it is often instinct to look down or at the ball. Losing sight of the basket will only hurt your shot. Incline your head slightly while jumping to keep the basket in view., An instant after you begin your jump, you'll need to take the ball and make the shot. When taking hold of the ball, delay your pickup slightly so you grip the ball high in the arc of its bounce. The ball should be at about chest level before you make the shot., At this point, one of your hands will be facing inside (toward the basket) and the other outside (toward the court). Take the ball in your outside hand while jumping, extend your arm, and flip the ball off the backboard and into the hoop.Unlike many distance shots, the reverse layup doesn't require you to shoot from the knees. Instead, focus on a strong, consistent, clean shooting motion.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119100}

{"text":" Using the middle of the free-throw stripe to position yourself can lead to an awkward 30 to 45 angle to the rim, and likely a bad free throw shot.Instead, hold the ball in your shooting hand. Then, stand in front of the basket and draw an invisible line from the ball in your hand to the rim of the basket.\nYour right toes will be just to the left of center and your right arm should line up with the basket.\nPositioning yourself this way will minimize your left-to-right or right-to-left movement and give you a more consistent free throw shot.\nIf you are a left handed shooter, you may want to practice a two handed free throw. It\u2019s difficult to be an accurate shooter with two hands, so you can use your left hand as your shooting hand if it feels comfortable.;\n, Some shooters keep their toes lined up behind the free throw line. Some shooters stagger their feet slightly. Try to find a stance where you feel balanced. You don\u2019t want a lopsided stance as this will lead to a poor shot.If you are a right handed shooter, your left foot may be a bit further back from your right foot. If you\u2019re a left handed shooter, your right foot may be a bit further back from your left foot., Don\u2019t lean forward. Simply transfer your weight forward into your toes.\n\n\nKeeping your back straight will keep you from stepping over the free throw line and getting a foul in a game.\n\n, Your legs are what will provide the upward power for your shot. So you want to place your weight in your toes and bend your legs to access this power, or the \u201cup\u201d motion.Some players find it more natural to stand with their knees straight and then initiate the shooting motion by dipping down and bending their knees. Then, they will straighten their knees as they go up for the shot, or a \u201cdown then up\u201d motion. Do whatever technique feels comfortable and natural for you.\n\n, Do not hold the ball in the palm of your shooting hand, as you won\u2019t generate enough power from your palm to throw the ball properly.\n\n\nHold the ball so the black lines on the basketball are going across the ball. This will help with your throw.\nThere should be a little pocket of space between your palm and the ball.\nPress your thumb, pointer and middle fingers against the ball to get a sense of the right hand placement. When you release the ball, those three fingers should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin, giving you a better chance of a successful shot.\n\n, Hold the ball on the tops of the fingers of your shooting hand and place your other hand on the other side of the ball.\n\n\nYour shooting hand should be under the ball and your free hand should be beside the ball. It will act as your guide hand and make sure the ball stays balanced as you take the free throw.\n\n, Don\u2019t let your elbow flap out to one side. Scoop it down and up so it is close to your body and in line with the rim. It should make an \u201cL\u201d shape.\n\n, As you shoot, don\u2019t take your eyes off the target! Lock your eyes on the rim, not the ball. The sudden jerk of your head from the rim to the ball will throw off your shot.\n\n, Your thumb, pointer and middle finger should be the last to touch the ball. This will give you a nice backspin or rotation on the ball.\n\n\nMake sure you come up on your toes as you release the ball. Coming up on your toes will ensure you are releasing as much power as possible from your legs into the shot.\nMake sure your back is straight and you aren\u2019t lunging forward with your upper body.\nIf you miss the basket by a few feet, this means you may need more power. Adjust this by jumping a little on your release to give your shot more power.\nIf you overshoot the basket, you may need less power in your throw. Adjust this by throwing with less force and further back from the free throw line.\n\n, Keep your shooting hand up in a \u201cgooseneck\u201d after you release the ball, until it goes into the net. You should be up on your toes and looking at the rim, not the ball in the air or as it lands in the rim.\n\n, A big part of a successful free throw shot in maintaining your focus and technique on every free throw. The only way to do this is to practice your free throw technique every day, at every practice until it becomes natural and almost like second nature. That way, when you are at the free throw line during a game, with one five seconds to go, surrounded by all the noise of the fans, you can simply focus on the rim and make the free throw, just like you practiced.Try to shoot 25 shots every day for 5 days of each week. Keep track of how many free throws you make and how many you miss. If you aren\u2019t making more than you miss, there may be a flaw in your technique. So evaluate your level of success and adjust your stance or your arm placement accordingly.As you practice, think: BEEF. Balance the ball, keep your Eye on the rim, keep your Elbow straight, and Follow through., Because a free throw does not involve defense, you can create a small ritual or routine before you make your shot. For example, every time Michael Jordan took a free throw, he followed the same ritual: spin the ball, dribble three times, spin the ball again, and then shoot. Relying on a ritual that you have practiced many times will relax and focus you before you take the shot.Create your own small ritual during your free throw practice. Start every free throw with this ritual so it feels natural and comfortable.\n\n, This can help you with your distance control, which is the control you have over how far or how short the ball goes when you shoot it.Stand 9 inches in front of the free throw line. Maintaining your free throw technique, shoot the ball, aiming for the back of the rim. Do this several times, missing the shot, but aiming at the back of the rim.\nMove 9 inches behind the line and hit the front of rim on each shot. Do this several time, missing the shot but hitting the front of the rim.\nFinally, move back to the free throw line and get into your free throw position. Try to swish each shot, using the same distance control you used in the previous spots on the court.\n\n, This may sound impossible, especially when you are just starting to get comfortable with your free throw technique. But once you develop a good technique and your technique feels comfortable through practice, you should be able to close your eyes, shoot, and swish the ball.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119102}

If you want to help out your teammates, use team-colored tape to help them instantly spot a friendly stick., Before you wrap around the blade, apply some tape to the bottom edge which skates along the ice with you. Keep the tape centered on the edge of the blade. There won't be much to grab onto, but you'll wrap it up more thoroughly when you go around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players will file down this edge to remove any burrs or chinks in the wood that have occurred over time before they apply tape. Check the smoothness and attend to any issues you find.\n\n, Picture the blade as a foot. Some players elect to go from the toe to the heel, while others prefer the more traditional heel-to-toe method. Pick your starting point, and wrap the tape vertically around the width of the blade, moving the tape down the blade diagonally. Overlap your previous wrap by no more than a quarter-inch or so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional wisdom says to tape from heel-to-toe because it creates more spin on the puck, but recent analysis of the fastest shooters has shown that spin actually slows the puck down. Depending on your style and your purposes, you can wrap your blade in either direction.\nIf you want a faster release off your blade, wrap toe-to-heel. If you want more spin, wrap heel-to-toe. While spin slows the puck down, it also makes it harder for the goalie to make a 5-hole save because the puck will still be spinning when he stops it between the pads.\n\n, It may seem strange to the uninitiated, but taking a small piece of paper (like a napkin) to start out with can help with the grip and is quite popular among players because it creates a distinctive butt for you to hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with the folded piece of paper around the edge of the handle, just under the knob, wrapping tape around it several times to keep it in place. If you don't have a knob in place on your stick, start the tape at the edge of the stick itself where the knob would be.\n\n, Without tearing, use your wrist to your elbow as a guide and twist the tape around, creating a kind of strong tape rope. Wrap this firmly around the handle of the stick, moving down diagonally to form the grip. Do not tear the tape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart wrapping the flat part of the tape (where you stopped winding) back up the handle and over the rope, overlapping it slightly, until you get back to the knob. Wrap it a couple more times around the handle at the knob to make sure everything is secure, then cut it.\n\n, Loading your stick with lots of tape can sometimes just weigh you down, adding extra weight to a stick that you'll get tired of carrying around by the end of the game. Figure out the most economical amount of tape you can use to get the right feel and response from your stick and stay with that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you get it right, or feel you've done a particularly good job taping it, measure the tape when you remove it after play. Remember how much you used and cut only that amount next time to make it easy (and cheap) on yourself.\n\n, Your own style will depend upon personal preference. Try out different tapers, knobs, and tapes to see what feels best. There is no right way to tape the handle and most players have different methods and routines particular to their play. All you're looking for here is grip and feel, so do what works best for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Start with the blade at the heel and press towards the toe. Rub the puck along the new tape job to smooth things out and work out any bubbles, which can tear and make your tape raggedy on the ice. The friction of the puck makes the tape bond better with the blade, resulting in a smoother action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Take some wax and apply it to all taped areas of the blade. This keeps the tape from getting waterlogged, increasing the longevity of the tape job and decreasing friction as the bottom of the blade moves along the ice. This is especially useful if you're taking lots of shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the best results, use stick wax, not generic wax of some other kind. This is widely available at sporting goods stores that specialize in hockey gear. But even candle wax will do in a pinch.\nMake sure your ice rink allows the use of wax. Some that don't regularly renew the ice or those that use the rink for other commercial purposes discourage this.\n\n, Some players have fairly elaborate taping routines, adding other bits to their stick for color, personality, or for practical purposes. Learn from other players and do what feels natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome players like to add a thick roll of tape midway down the stick, about 3\/8\" thick, to help with picking the stick up off the ice when gloves are on.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119103}
{"text":" Before the shot even goes in the air, be on the lookout for a good position. First, look for other players on your team, and make sure you are not getting in a teammate's way. If you do not see any teammates close to the hoop, move in to try and get the rebound.Communicate with your teammates by yelling, \u201cShot\u201d as soon as you see the ball go up.\nBoth defensive and offensive players should look for a rebound, so don't worry about your position. Rebounds are important to the game, so go for them as much as possible.\nIf you took the shot yourself, follow the shot to the basket to try to get your own rebound. The majority of first shots in basketball are not made. Therefore, there's a good chance you'll miss on your first try, so be prepared for a rebound.;\n, If you did not take the shot yourself, a good way to prepare for a rebound is to get low on the ground. You may have to jump in the air to catch the basketball. You may also need to block opposing players going for the rebound, a process called boxing out. This usually involves crouching slightly so, in the event you have to box out another player, you will already be in the right position.\n\n\nUse your legs to keep other players from getting between you and the basket. Bend your knees slightly and spread your legs, making your body bigger. This will block other players behind you who are considering the rebound.Stay on the balls of your feet so you are ready to move and jump when the ball comes down.\n\n, Keep your hands up and arms open wide. This allows you to have the widest coverage on the court, blocking other players. It also prepares your arms for catching the ball. When the rebound comes, you'll need to jump and grab quickly.The opposing player can also choose to pin your arms down. This is another reason why keeping your arms up is important.\n\n, Boxing out, as stated, is a means of blocking another player from reaching the basket. You can use your hands and feet to position yourself between the opposing player and the basket. If you're crouching and spreading your arms, you're already in the box out position. Just keep an eye on the player behind you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush the other player back with your behind as you spread your arms and legs out wide to keep them behind you. You have to make first contact, so locate any potential opposing players and move in front of them.Be prepared to reposition yourself as the opposing player attempts to move around you. Move backward if necessary, forcing the opposing player further back in the court. If you're boxing out an opponent too close to the net, the player can easily jump up over you and get the rebound.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119104}

Some common ways of getting a penalty are stripping, high sticking (hitting a player or the puck above the height of the net),boarding (checking or hitting a player too far away from the boards),charging, roughing (fighting) and interference (doing anything to a player that isn't in possession of the puck.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119105}
{"text":" Take the allowed two steps while palming the ball in your dunking hand and controlling your approach. Leap from your plant foot, opposite your shooting hand, extend your arm to the rim, and drive the ball through the net.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDunk one-handed first. The two-handed slam is maybe the most dominating move in basketball, but it takes a lot more leap to touch the rim with two hands. You can build up to it.;\n, It's much easier, when you're first starting out, to try dunking with a smaller ball. You'll be able to palm it more easily and control your approach, making the maneuver more satisfying and your practice closer to the real thing. Continue dribbling and shooting exercises with the appropriate-sized ball so you're not getting too used to the \"wrong\" size, but keep a small ball around for your sick dunks., Get a feel for how to use inertia to control the ball when your arm is extended. Even people who can palm a basketball sometimes lose their grip when dunking, so you need to get a feel for maneuvering the ball and controlling it in the air.\n\n\nPractice running at the rim and slamming the ball against it. Even if you're not \"dunking,\" you're still practicing your approach and holding the ball correctly as you leap toward the hoop.\nYou can try a tennis ball or golf ball first, then a volleyball, and work your way up to a basketball.\n\n, It's common to focus all your energy on getting the rock in the hole and end up falling on your butt, which hurts. A lot. It happens, even to the pros, but spend some time completing the follow-through and focusing on completing the entire sequence of moves, landing safely, and you'll dunk more accurately and more consistently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the successful dunk and immediately focus on your landing. Try to land on both feet, cushioning your legs and flexing into the landing. Watch out for other players.\nDon't hang on the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you, but hanging on the rim can damage the hoop, and also throw you off balance, pulling your legs out from under you so you fall backwards. So don't try to grab the rim after you've slammed the ball, just dunk it and drop.\n\n, Start with an adjustable height basket, if you have access to one. Lower the height so you can get a feel for dunking, then raise it gradually to the standard height as you improve.\n\n, Most players find that high-quality shoes improve their ability to dunk, and more importantly, prevent you from getting hurt when you try to dunk.\n\n, You'll likely embarrass yourself during your first several attempts to dunk, but get up off the floor and try again. You'll be very impressed at your improvement if you keep practicing your leaps and building the strength in your legs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You will need the lifting power of your legs to get you in the air and up to the basket. Building a regimen of leg workouts that will increase the fast-twitch strength and the flexibility of your leg muscles can help you add inches to your vertical leap, getting you that much closer to the rim.A good regimen to get started with might include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50-100 calf raises\n\n2 or 3 sets of squats and lunges\n\n3-5 sets of 60 second wall sits\n\n\n, Plyometrics are exercises that use the resistance of your own body to build strength and are essential for building the kind of strength necessary to build your jump. It takes time to train your body to jump higher, but working the right muscle groups can improve your explosiveness and height without maxing out regularly in the weight room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle groups that need to be stronger: Quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, calves. The quadriceps extend the knee, while the hamstrings and gluteals extend the hip. The calves flex the ankle, giving you that initial hop.\n\n, Just building strength in your legs won't do it. The muscles also need to be loose and flexible, giving you the movement and response you'll need to dunk over the defense. Develop your flexibility by regularly stretching, doing elastic resistance exercises, and giving yoga a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle groups that need flexibility: Hamstrings and hip flexors. Tight hamstrings will impede the knee extension during the jump. Hip flexors resist the hip extension part of the jump.\n\n, Coaches make you run stairs for a reason. Running stairs will develop all the quadriceps, hips, and calves, helping to build all-around leg strength and flexibility. It's also cheap. You can run stairs at your house, at school after-hours, or even on the bleachers outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Jump across the whole court and back. Try three laps or more, leaping as high as you can each time. Jump to touch the net with a running jump until you are able to do it ten times in a row. You probably won't be able to do this all in one day. Keep working at it. Keep jumping. Set your sights on the rim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Shaquille O'Neal was known for double-handing the ball into the goal so forcefully, the backboard would shatter. While rim technology makes that not particularly possible any more, it's still a powerful and demoralizing dunk to pull off.\n\n\nYou need a really high vertical to pull of a two-handed dunk. Practice standing under the rim and jumping straight up until you can touch your wrists to the rim.\n\n, Suggesting you're so high you could dunk it twice, in the double-pump dunk you bring the ball back down to chest level at the apex of your leap, then force it back up to slam it with authority. Some notable players, Tracy McGrady among them, would do this regularly while spinning in the air, doing a 360 dunk variation.\n\n, As you approach, bring the ball into your abdomen and back, extending your arm behind your body and up in a circular fashion, like a windmill spinning. At the apex of your jump, bring your arm all the way around to throw it down like a boss. Dominique Wilkins, the Dunkmaster General of the 90s, used to blow crowds away with this spectacular dunk.\n\n, Either two-handed or one-handed, the tomahawk dunk involves bringing the ball back over your head by bending your elbows and slamming it forcefully into the hoop, as if you were chopping a tomahawk. \"Dr. J\" Julius Erving popularized this poster dunk, as well as Darryl Dawkins, who broke several backboards tomahawk dunking.\n\n, While he wasn't the first player to complete it, Vince Carter wowed crowds at the 2000 NBA dunk contest by passing the ball under one leg while in the air and slamming it with authority. It didn't hurt that his forehead was almost touching the rim. If you've worked your ups to that height, try passing it under one leg and dunking it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119106}
{"text":" Like all dunks, a windmill requires you to jump high. Start a windmill dunk by approaching the basket while dribbling, then jump toward it as high as you can., One of the distinctive features of a windmill dunk is that it is executed with one hand. As you jump in the air, you must take the ball with you in your dominant hand., While jumping in the air and holding onto the ball with one hand, swing your fully extended arm around in a circular motion. This movement should be smooth and even, like a windmill going around., As your extended, rotating arm approaches the basket, slam the ball in the basket. This should happen as quickly and smoothly as possible. After the ball goes in, return your arm to a normal position as you hit the ground., High jumping is essential for doing a windmill dunk, so train to build strength in your legs and lower body. Squats, lunges, hamstring curls, and leg presses are all good exercises to try for this purpose., Whether or not you are tall, you will have to have excellent upward movement in order to do a windmill dunk. Strength and ability combine to make powerful jumps. Try doing skips, squat jumps, and toe raises as practice to improve your ability to launch yourself upwards.If you are a shorter or average sized player, dunking can be difficult, though not necessarily impossible. Practice jumping, and work with a coach to determine if dunking is within your reach.\n\n, If you need help figuring out how high you need to jump in order to make a dunk, try using a dunk calculator. Enter in your height, the rim height, and extra height for the dunk itself to calculate how high you need to jump in order to dunk the ball. You can then use this information in order to practice achieving the jump height you need., Some players prefer to do dunks by jumping with two feet. However, you may be able to achieve your maximum jump height more easily if you jump with one foot while reaching upwards with your arm. Jump with your non-dominant foot and keep the ball in your dominant hand. For example, a right handed player will jump with the left foot while rotating the right arm., If your jumping or dunking feels unsteady, you may need more balance in the air. As you jump to make the windmill dunk, hold your non-dominant arm either at your side or up in the air. Experiment with each position to see which one gives you better balance., Before attempting a windmill jump, you can practice leaping toward the basket with empty hands. This allows you to get a sense of your maximum height, and to practice the basic movements. Jump upwards and rotate your arm just as you would if you were holding a ball, until the movement feels balanced and fluid., Holding onto a full-sized basketball while learning to do a windmill dunk can be difficult. In order to build your familiarity with the move, you can try dunking a smaller ball (such as a tennis ball or mini basketball) until you feel confident jumping and rotating your arm. Then, move on to practicing with a full-sized basketball., Once you\u2019ve mastered the basic windmill dunk, you can try some variations on the technique. A popular move is the 360 windmill dunk. To do this, spin your body in a 360 degree turn as you dunk the ball in the basket, windmill-style., Another popular and challenging variation on the basic windmill dunk is to try it backwards. Unlike a regular windmill dunk, you perform this move by holding onto the ball with both hands. Jump while facing away from the basket and bring the ball down toward your chest with both hands. Once you are up near the basket, rotate the ball behind your head (using both hands) and dunk it into the basket., You can develop your own personal style of windmill dunking, once you are familiar with the technique. Be creative and combine a windmill dunk with other dunking and dribbling techniques. For instance, you could work with another play to try an alley-oop windmill dunk.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119107}

These are the time when you got to learn real street ball moves.\n\n, In street ball, you might be able to get in a few good dunks but your opponent will be guarding the hoop closely. If he is worried about guarding the hoop, he will not be concerned about you taking a shot from the three point line. Once he figures out that you can shoot and dunk, he will have to stay closely on you which is when you put some moves on him to put him in his place.

{"text":" The defender should always have his man in front of him (relative to the net). In professional basketball, the player who receives the ball has someone behind him.;\n, When a pass is coming towards him, try pulling your hands out from behind and tip it away. If the player is in post position, he'll most likely be still. Keep a hand in front of him to deny it. But still, be careful not to commit a foul by trying to reach in for the steal. If he's more of a perimeter player, he'll most likely be running around to get free of you, so try to keep up. If he thinks he's open, try waiting for a pass to come up to him, and jump in and tip it away.\n\n, If the player is post, he will most likely be backing into you.\n\n\nBest thing to do is have ONE hand on his back(this is allowed) and stop him from advancing further. If he is a good post player, he will try faking and then spinning around and laying it around you. You must observe him, and try not to fall for these. He could also pump fake then go under you. Once he shoots, you can try blocking it. He will most likely be fading away; if he's much taller than you, he'll shoot right over you. When blocking have your hands STRAIGHT, not bending and try swatting it. If you don't think it'll work, put your hands in front of his face (straight still) and contest the shot, but don't hit him. Beware, he could do multiple pump fakes.\n\n, Now onto the perimeter based players. These players will most likely be harder to guard.

You, as a defender, will need to be prepared for all of this.\n\n\nKnow his range. This is a little thing that will help A LOT. If he isn't as great of a shooter, take him out of his comfort zone.

That way, you can move quickly as he moves or drives. If he drives quickly, move back and attempt to contest the shot, but be aware of a foul call.\nWatch out for pump fakes.\nWhen trying to block the shot, you can try this alternative: put your hands in front of his face when he shoots.\nHe could Hop Step, which means jump one way then the other, or close to get rid of you to get off an open look shot.\nStay far enough that if he likes to drive you can react quick enough; if too close one step might be all he needs.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119109}

{"text":" You need at least two players to play. There is no limit to the number of players you can have in each game. Each player should be able to shoot and rebound a basketball., Unlike most variations of the game, knockout requires that you use two basketballs simultaneously. Purchase two regulation sized basketballs. Test to verify that the basketballs are still properly inflated.\n\n\nGenerally, when you drop a properly inflated basketball, it should bounce back to about two thirds of height from which it was dropped. For a more exact measure of how inflated the ball should be, check the instructions that come with the ball. The instructions should specify how heavy the ball ought to be., The first person in the line should be directly behind the foul line. The first and the second person should each have their own basketball.\n\n\nThe foul line, also known as the free throw line, is a line on the court inside the three-point line. There should be a rectangle on the court that is adjacent to the semicircle which intersects with the three-point line. The foul line is the line where the rectangle and semicircle meet.\nThe foul line is where professional players shoot from when they have been fouled.\nIf you are playing at home and need to create your own line, the standard distance for the foul line is 15 feet from the backboard. Use a piece of chalk or tape to mark off the line., The player is not allowed to advance beyond the line before taking his first shot. After the first shot, however, he can run up and shoot from whatever location he chooses too. He should keep on shooting until he gets it in, at which point he can run to the back of the line.\n\n\nThe player is not required to dribble the ball after picking it back up again.\nThere are variants of the game in which the player is required to return to and shoot from behind the three point line, but that is not the standard way to play.The person who starts out in the front of the line will always be at a disadvantage. Every player will rotate to the front, but the person who starts there won't have anyone in front of them who they can knock out.\n\n, After the first person in line has taken his shot, the second can advance to the foul line and take his own shot. If he misses, he should rebound as quickly as possible and take another shot from anywhere on the court. He should continue shooting until he scores., Once a player gets the ball in the basket, he returns to the back of the line. There, he is safe until the line cycles through and he is back to the front of the line.When the player scores, he should pass it to the next person in line as quickly as possible. The faster that player gets it, the more likely it is that he will have the time to score and eliminate another player.\n\n, If the first shooter scores, then no one is eliminated from the game. However, if the second person to shoot scores first, the person in front of him is eliminated.To get an advantage, you can \u201cbump\u201d or \u201cknock\u201d the ball. This is when you take your ball and use it to bounce the other ball off the court. The other player will need to chase the ball and will lose valuable time. You can knock the ball directly out of the other player\u2019s hands, if possible.\n\n, Cycle through the line as many times as is necessary. Each time you cycle through, some players should be eliminated by the person behind them. By the end, there will only be one player standing.\n\n, You should keep your feet approximately shoulder length apart. Your shooting foot should be slightly in front of the other foot. Bend your knees slightly when you begin to shoot.\n\n\nIt is important to keep a consistent stance. So that you can develop a feel for how to shoot the ball accurately, try to shoot it the same way every time. To do this, be conscious of how you position your feet., Spread your fingers far enough apart to balance the ball on your fingers. Position one hand on the center of the ball, with the air hole between your middle and index fingers. Place the other hand on the side of the ball, along the long seam of the ball.\n\n\nKeep some distance between your palm and the ball. The ball should rest on your fingertips.\nThe hand on the side is only used to balance the ball. You should not apply any force to the ball from that hand. Remove this balance hand as you take your shot., Align the ball and your eyes directly with the rim of the basket. Bend over slightly, keeping the ball a couple of inches above your waist. Maintain a consistent from every time you line up for your shot., As you shoot, straighten your body and jump. Simultaneously lift the ball so that your elbow is directly underneath the ball. The ball should be above your head, aligned with your eyes and the basket. Flip your wrist just before the high point of your jump to propel the ball toward the net.\n\n\nTo maintain balance and aim, jump straight up. You should aim to land at exactly the same point from which you jumped., Rebounds are unpredictable, but typically the ball bounces back in a particular direction, depending upon where you take your shot. If you are shooting from the foul line, the ball is somewhat more likely to rebound directly back than to the side. However, shots taken from the side of the rim tend to bounce to one side or another.\n\n\nWhen shooting from the front, the ball will rebound to the front 40% of the time and has a thirty percent chance of rebounding to one side or the other.\nWhen taking a shot from the side, there is only a 20% chance that the ball will rebound to the front. There is a 40% chance that it will rebound back to the side from which you shot, and a 40% chance that it will rebound to the opposite side.\nBecause it is extremely disadvantageous to chase the ball to the opposite side of the court, you are better off taking shots from directly in front of the backboard. There, your chances of the basketball rebounding back in your direction is higher.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119111}

If you miss both shots, it is the next person's turn to shoot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is nowhere to go back to on the first shot, there is no reason to skip your second shot., This is where the strategy comes into play. If you miss two shots in a row, you must start over on your next turn. But if you miss the first one you can skip your next shot. When it is your turn again you get to start from the same spot you left off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a big lead, it is often best to wait. Remember, however, that it only takes one good turn for someone to catch up -- or even win.\nIf you're behind, it might be worth the risk to take your second shot. If you can develop some rhythm, one great round might help you come back.\n\n, You could theoretically win on the very first turn if you make every shot. The goal, especially for real basketball, is to develop shooting consistency, getting into a rhythm of good shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Every player should get the same number of chances to win. Say, for example, you're playing with four people who shoot in the order A, B, C, and D. During the fifth round, player B makes every bucket and wins. However, players C and D only got to play for four rounds. They each get one more chance to win, forcing a playoff. Player A, who got the same number of chances as Player B, loses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor tie-breakers, play one more round. Whatever player gets the furthest around wins.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119112}
{"text":" As you build confidence and skill, you can learn to stop harder, at greater speeds. This is the technique that ice hockey players and other professional ice skaters use. It becomes necessary, at some point, as you need to stop quickly and efficiently in order to keep up with the competition. If you're a beginner, however, you don't need to worry about mastering this right away., You can be gliding more quickly than you would for the \"snowplow stop,\" but you should still feel as though you are in control. In certain high-performance situations\u2014an intense hockey game, or a complex figure-skating move\u2014you may need to come to a halt or change directions very quickly. In general, avoid trying to suddenly stop while flying across the rink at your top speed., As you glide, go into a half-crouch, as though you're going to sit. Make sure to keep your knees shoulder-width apart. This is called un-weighting yourself. Then, turn your skates sideways not-quite-90 degrees from the direction that you were going before.\n\n, With your knees bent, lean away from the direction you are heading. Focus your weight on the side of your feet that is away from the direction that you are moving.\n\n, Slowly but firmly dig the edge of your skates into the ice. Hold fast, and dig harder as you slow down. Ride the friction until you come to a halt.Only a small portion of the skates should be in contact with the ice, thus minimizing friction and eventually allowing you to stop on a dime.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119113}
{"text":" Round up two or more people. Each person is their own team. Everyone keeps track of their own score., On a regulation basketball court, this is a straight horizontal line. Usually, this is 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m) from the basket.However, if you\u2019re playing on a driveway or smaller court, you can improvise.\n\n, This is the large semi-circle that encloses the free-throw line on a regulation court. Usually, this is 23.75 feet (7.24\u00a0m) from the basket.Feel free to improvise on a smaller court.\n\n, Every game of 21 has its basic rules. However, you and the other players can make adjustments to create a challenge or make things easier for beginners.Some common rules are:\n\n\nRegular shots are worth 2 points each. You can make them anywhere on the court except the free-throw or 3-point line.\n3-point shots are worth 3 points each. Make them from the 3-point line.\nFree-throw shots are worth 1 point each. Make them from the free-throw line., Take turns shooting at the hoop rim. The first person to hit the rim takes possession of the ball.You could adjust this rule so that you have to get the ball in the basket in order to take possession.\n\n, The player with possession shoots the ball at the 3-point line. All other players try to stop them from making the basket.This is called busting-in or breaking-in the ball. A successful bust gets the opponent 2 points., Each 2-point shot you make earns you a 1-point shot from the free-throw line. After you make 3 shots in a row, one of your opponents can check you in a one-on-one match-up. If you make that shot, you get 2 points.If you miss your free throw, try to stop your opponents from putting the ball back in the basket.\n\n, Dribble the ball outside the 3-point line. This happens if someone misses the 2-point shot and one of their opponents rebounds the ball. The player with the ball can\u2019t shoot before clearing., Shoot additional 1- 2-, and 3-point shots until someone gets 21 points. In basic rules, the first player to 21 wins. You could end the game there or have a rematch.\n\n, In a tip-in, one player shoots the ball toward the basket but misses. Meanwhile, another player jumps, catches the ball, and scores before it hits the ground.Make the game more challenging by reducing the score of the \u201ctipped\u201d shooter (the one who missed their shot).\n\n\nYou can reduce it to 13 or a lower number if the player has less than 13 points. To make it even more interesting, reduce the score to zero.\n\n, Make a rule that the winner must have at least 21 points and lead by a set number of points. For example, you could agree to continue beyond 21 points until someone leads by 2, 4, or more points., Sometimes, a player will have to make a free-throw shot in order to make it to 21. If they miss, their score gets rolled back to 13 points.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119114}
{"text":" For clarifying purposes, the first four people are labeled Players 1-4, Player 1 being at the front of the line. Player 1 and Player 2 should each hold a basketball.\n\n\nIn the beginning of the game, Player 1 may also call \"first person protection\" so that Player 2 and Player 3 will both have to score the ball before Player 1 is out.;\n, Once (s)he shoots, Player 2 may begin shooting their ball.Players 1 and 2 can bump each others' basketballs whenever except if in player's hands.

{"text":" You will need two teams, each with the same number of players. In college intramural BASEketball regulations, each team is allowed a maximum of six (6) players.Of course, you can play with however many people you recruit.;\n, Each team will need a mix of offensive and defensive players. In a team of six players, you will want three offensive players and three defensive players.\n\n\nFor defense, two players serve in the \"outfield\" and one is stationed next to the shooter to attempt \"psych outs,\" which will be explained in Part 3.\nFor offense, three players are on the field: one will be the shooter and, just like in baseball, the other two are runners on bases.\n\n, In baseball, there are nine innings, each a period of play where one team plays offense and the other plays defense.You can use all nine, or you can decide on whatever number you'd like.\n\n, You can use a hoop mounted on a building or a freestanding hoop. Just make sure you have about 20 feet of free space in front of it to set up your court.\n\n, Sidewalk chalk is great for this because it washes right off and comes in different colors. A BASEketball court combines elements from baseball and basketball, using a space about half the size of a basketball court. Imagine it like a baseball diamond inside a rectangular basketball half-court.\n\n, The \"top\" of the diamond should be just in front of the basketball hoop. The \"bottom\" of the diamond, also known as \"home base,\" should be about 20-25 feet away from the hoop and located directly across from it. You may want to make home base a little bigger or use a different color of chalk to distinguish it.\n\n\nJust as in baseball, 1st base is located on the diamond to the right of home base, and 3rd base is located on the diamond to the left of home base.\n\n, Use different colors of chalk to distinguish them, if you have it. The various shooting locations radiate outward from the hoop in a roughly triangular shape, with the spots closest to the hoop located closer together and spread out farther apart as they get farther from the hoop. Spread out each row of squares so that one is in the middle of the \"diamond\" (roughly in line with the hoop and home base) and the others slant off to either side just outside the diamond. The squares should form a rough line so that the triple square is a bit behind the double square, which is a bit behind the single square, etc.\n\n\nDraw two \"bunt\" squares just in front of the hoop to either side. The bunt squares should be in line with 2nd base (just in front of the hoop).\nDraw three single squares at the free throw line (about 15 feet from the hoop).\nDraw three double squares between the free throw line and 3-point line (between 15 and 20 feet from the hoop).\nDraw three triple squares at the 3-point line (just over 20 feet from the hoop)\n\n, Whoever makes the first shot from the foul line (a horizontal line running between first and third base) will get the ball.\n\n, The player who got possession of the ball in Step 1 chooses a square to shoot from. The square chosen determines the number of bases awarded if the player makes the shot: singles get one base, doubles two, triples three.\n\n\nThe bunt squares move runners ahead one base each, but they cannot go to home base on a bunt. Bunting also results in a \"sacrifice out.\". If your team has two outs already, you cannot make a bunt.\n\n, You must stand within the shooting square while taking the shot. Stepping outside the square counts as an out. If you miss a shot -- meaning you fail to hit the basket or the backboard of the hoop -- it is counted as an out. A player counted \"out\" cannot shoot again for the remainder of the inning. If you make the shot, the number of bases is awarded based on the square you're shooting from.\n\n\nYou cannot shoot from the same square twice. Once a shot has been taken from a square, a team cannot use it again for the rest of the inning. You may find it helpful to use small objects such as bean bags to mark used squares.\nIf your shot does not enter the hoop but makes contact with the target, you may be able to use a \"put back.\" In basketball, a \"put back\" occurs when a player is able to secure a rebound from his\/her own team's missed shot. If you or a team-mate can \"put back\" the shot, you score.\n\n, After a successful shot, players must run the bases just as in baseball. A shot scored from a single square would advance the runner one base, and so on.\n\n, A unique feature of BASEketball is that each player must shoot a specific order in each inning. If a player shoots a single the first time, they must attempt a double the next time they are \"up to bat,\" and a triple the next time. If the first shot is a home run, a single must be played on the next turn.\n\n, Two players serve in the \"outfield\" near the hoop in order to attempt rebound shots. The third defensive player stands near the shooter and attempts a \"psych out.\"\n\n, \"Psych-outs\" are a hallmark of BASEketball and are used to disrupt the shooter's concentration. Only one player may play \"psych-out\" tactics at a time; there is no double-teaming. The \"psych-out\" defense may use props, hollering, and all kinds of silly behavior as diversion tactics, but is not supposed to actually touch the ball or the shooter, limit his\/her line of sight, or impair his\/her vision (such as putting your hands in front of his\/her face). Of course, a lot of play is good sportsmanship, so make sure you also don't hurt anyone's feelings!\n\n, The offense can attempt a \"put-back\" if the shooter misses a shot. The defense can also try to rebound a missed shot using a \"double play\" if the defense has runners on base. If the defense rebounds the shot, the shooter and the player closest to home base are both counted out.\n\n\nIf the defense misses the shot during a double-play, the offense is allowed to \"tip in\" the missed shot for a play conversion. A valid tip in must be shot with both feet off the ground (so you'll have to jump to try one).< Any player on base is allowed to attempt a tip in. If the first tip in is missed, the shooter can also attempt a tip-in. If this shot succeeds, the shooter is awarded the base(s) s\/he was originally attempting.\nOnly two attempts at conversion may be made during a play. If no shot succeeds after two attempts, the play is called as \"dead.\"\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119116}
{"text":" When rivets go bad on hockey skates they either fall out (yay no removal) or get loose. Test this by trying to put a flat head between the head of the rivet and the blade holder. Only use a small amount pressure, as you just want to make sure it is still holding, not pull extra ones out. Count the number or loose or missing rivets and make note which ones you will want to replace.;\n,, The easiest way to remove the rivets is to use wire cutters or bolt cutters and chop the end off from the bottom of the skate (blade side) and the remainder will fall out inside the boot.\n\n\nIf the part of the rivet does not fall out on its own, you can use the new bolt to push it out from the bottom of the skate towards the boot. If you don\u2019t have cutters then you can pry them off with a pair of needle nose pliers but this is much harder.\n\n, Some skates have bolts instead of rivets and the female portion inside the base of the boot loses its traction and needs to be removed (like Graf skates). Here you will need to pry the boot away from the blade holder (it will already be pulling away if they need replacing).\n\n\nNext you will need to use the needle nose pliers to grab the female portion and hold it while you use the star shaped wrench set (or whatever the bolt head requires) and remove the bolt. If you had to use this method, use Gorilla Glue to glue the space where the female portion of the bolt was.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Take your bolt and place it through the hole where the rivets used to be, checking all holes to make sure it fits. Some might require some pressure or to be screwed through. This is good as it leaves less gaps or wiggle room for the bolt to move around.\n\n\nThis is where the size of the bolt varies; you can use smaller or larger diameter bolts to accommodate the size holes. If necessary, you can use a drill to widen the hole but ultimately the bolt will hold as long as the bolt fits through.\n\n, As stated earlier, optimally you want to use a washer as large as possible but does not sit on the side of the boot and creates unwanted height and an annoyance you will feel when your foot is in your skate.\u00a0 Using the larger washer will just hold better than a smaller one and with old skates it will diversify the pressure when skating. If you are using the same size washer throughout you don\u2019t need to measure anything.\n\n\nYour washer will need to be placed on the bolt then you will place it in the hole from the inside of the boot so the end of the bolt sticks out towards the blade. \u00a0 To make sure the washers all fit you can either:\n\nA: one by one go over each hole you are going to be filling and figure out which washers you will use where.\nB: measure as you replace each bolt. To stay organized, place each bolt with the washer it needs on the insole mirroring where it will be placed in the skate.\n\n\n\n, Place the Phillips head screwdriver on the bolt and keep pressure on the bolt the whole time.,, (You might have to switch to the pliers at some point if the blade holder gets in the way of your socket) \u00a0,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119117}

{"text":" The following sections will explain the individual positions for each player involved, in the style of your role as coach telling the players where to go, and what to expect.\n, Let\u2019s say the puck is in the right corner down in the offensive zone. Depending on what your coach wants, the right winger would typically set up on the board side hash marks. They don\u2019t want to be hugging the boards, but just a bit off of them. The right winger can act as a few things for this power play. They can be an outlet pass for the center that will be below the goal line or they can be the middleman and deliver the puck from down low to the defenseman up top.\n\n\nThe right winger can also drive towards the net and look to give a pass to the left winger that will be floating around looking to get open or take a shot on net. This is the same deal for the left winger, so it just depends on what side the puck is on.\n\n, Again, depending on where your coach wants you, typically the center hangs out down below the goal line, shifting with the puck from the right corner to the left corner. The center is meant to be an outlet pass for the wingers on the hash marks and for the defensemen up top. The center can skate the puck from corner to corner looking to create something and to look for open ice. The center and the defenseman up top can pass back and forth, but that only depends on how tight the defending team is pressuring. The center can either skate it towards the net, pass to the winger hanging around the center of the net, or pass back and forth with the winger trying to cause a mistake for the defending team.\n, This one is quite easy. Typically, the defensemen don\u2019t want to go below the top of the circles. The reason for that is that just in case the defending team finds a whole in the power play, they can\u2019t get a break away or an odd man rush. So, to be smart, the two defensemen should try to stay above the circles.\n\nLet\u2019s say the puck is on the left side of the ice. This will mean that the left side defenseman will be close to the left side boards just a few steps above the circle. They are looking for a pass down low or to take a one timer on net. They can also receive a pass from either the winger or the center and walk the puck towards the middle of the ice and take a shot on net or pass it over to the right side defenseman. While the puck is down in the right corner, the left side defenseman will be in the middle of the ice between the middle of the circles. Depending on how low the right side defenseman is, the left side defenseman should either hang high or can sneak down towards the top of the circles.\n\n, There are an endless amount of options for the team running the overload power play., As mentioned above, the wingers have quite a few options when the puck is on their stick. They can either pass it down to the center, pass it up top to the defenseman, drive towards the net looking for an open shot, look for the opposite side winger hanging around the net, or if nothing is open, create a battle along the boards. Really, the wingers can do whatever they want to do with the puck as long as their coach approves of it. Those with a good hockey sense can create space and pick up on opportunities to create something good.\n\n, These are pretty endless. If there is no open ice and the defending team has a pretty solid penalty kill going, the center could start what is called a cycle. The cycle can be run with either two players or three. Again, it all depends on what your coach wants.\n\nLet\u2019s say your coach wants a two man cycle. If the puck is down in the left corner, the center and the left winger will run the cycle down in the left corner. All that is done in the cycle is the center will skate the puck up towards the hash marks and throw the puck down back into the corner, trying their best to keep the puck along the boards so the defending team can\u2019t pick it up. The left winger will loop and basically just follow the center. Once the left winger picks up the puck they can either walk it out and drive it to the net, get a quick shot on net, or cycle again back down to the center that will be looping back around to the corner. The cycle just creates space and can throw the defending team off.\n\n, With these directions on where each player should be placed and what roles each player can play, your team's overload power play should be a success.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119119}

During the time before the game, try to use as little energy as possible before you head to the rink. When you arrive at the rink you will need a medicine ball, preferably five to eight pounds, and either two racquetballs or tennis balls depending on your skill level.;\n, This will give you plenty of time to do all that is required to prepare. First, you need to leave your phone and any other distracting devices in your car, at home, or with a parent or trusted friend. This does not include devices for playing music. When you arrive at the rink put all your equipment in the locker room. Take the medicine ball and roll it against your muscles in your legs, your back, and your abs. This will help to loosen you up as well as help you build muscle. Then take out your two racquet balls and find a solid and flat wall. Stand two or three feet from the wall. Throw the balls against the wall either one at a time, both at the same time, or alternating between the two. This will work on your reaction time and will warm up your arms and eyes.

You can also try to mentally picture yourself making saves.\n\n, Wait for the rest of the team to be ready to go out and make sure you are in the front. You need to lead the team out onto the ice.\n\n, There should at least be three waves of shots. Use the first round of shots to work your upper body.

{"text":" Hockey is a game played by two teams of six players each, five of whom skate around the rink in an attempt to score points, and one of whom guards the goal placed at each end of the rink. The object of the game is to score more points by passing the puck, a small rubber cylinder or rubber ball, through their opponent's goal more times than the other team. Each goal is worth one point.\n\n\nA game of hockey consists of three periods, of variable time lengths depending on the level of the competition, though most games consist of three 20 minute periods.;\n, While hockey can be played on roller skates (roller hockey) or on foot (floor hockey), the most popular and common type of hockey is played on the ice. Ice hockey is played on an ice rink that is 200 feet (61.0\u00a0m) long and 85 feet (25.9\u00a0m) wide and divided into three sections, demarcated by the blue lines on the ice. In the middle of the rink, there is a red line that divides both territories of play, and two blue lines fifty feet from each side of the red line. Between the two blue lines is called the \"neutral zone,\" while the space outside the blue lines is defended by each team.\n\n\nAt the ends of the rink, there are two thinner red lines where the net goes. In front of the goal there is an area called the crease. The crease is usually colored blue. This is the goaltender's area.\nOn the rink are also five face-off circles in which the puck is dropped to begin play at the beginning of the game, the period, or after a penalty that stops play.\n\n, Each hockey game starts with a \"face-off,\" in which the puck is dropped by a referee between two opposing players at close range. From there, the clock starts and the game begins. One team takes control of the puck and attempts to score while the other team attempts to defend their goal or intercept the puck.\n\n\nLike soccer or lacrosse, the game features fluid non-stop play, only pausing the action at the end of each period, after each point, or after a penalty.\n\n, In hockey, major and minor penalties are distinguished by the length of time the player is sent off the ice and into the penalty box. A minor penalty results in 2 minutes of penalty box time, while a major results in 5 minutes.If a penalty is committed, the team must play down a player for the length of time of the penalty, without substituting a new player in. If the opposing team scores during the penalty period, the penalty ends. The same violations may result in a major or minor distinction at the discretion of the referee. Common penalties include:\n\nDangerous use of the stick, including slashing or high-sticking\nObstruction penalties, including hooking or tripping\nInterfering with or checking a player not in control of the puck\nChecking from behind or by targeting the head\n\n\n\n, Because of the tough physical demands of ice hockey, players wear nearly as much if not more gear than football players, the most unique of which is the hockey stick and the skates.\n\n\n\nHockey sticks are wood or polycarbonate poles with a curved end, called the blade. Players use the stick to shuffle the puck across the ice and attempt to score. Getting a stick is essential in playing ice hockey. Get a size-fitted stick and learn to wrap it for play.\n\nHockey skates are sharpened and fitted for playing ice hockey. Hockey skates are more curved than regular ice skates, made for maneuverability and speed. They should be tight, with good ankle support and should be sharpened regularly.\n\nHelmet and pads should be fitted to your body shape and weight. Usually, a hockey pad set-up includes shoulder pads, leg pads, and a secure helmet that will allow you to skate hard and play safely.\n\n, Even if you're a proficient ice-skater, skating in hockey requires a whole new set of skills. Learning to change direction and brake properly without crashing into the boards will take some time, but developing a routine of practice will have you moving fast in no time. Before you even pick up a stick, develop your skating skills until skating is as natural as walking.\n\n\nSkating backwards is essential in being a good all-around hockey player, allowing you to change direction at a moments notice and follow the play without having to adjust constantly. Learn to complete a \"mohawk\" by switching position quickly, stepping into your in-step while moving forward and transitioning to skating backwards.\nCrossovers are also an essential part of hockey skating. Hockey players often change direction quickly not by skating, but by taking several quick side-steps, called cross-overs. Practice gripping the ice with your skates and taking side-steps to improve your game.\n\n, In your non-dominant hand, hold the ball at the end of the stick handle, centering the stick with your body. Your other hand should hold the stick down two glove-lengths. The grip should be firm, but not tight.Keep the hockey stick out in front of you, your arms comfortably flexed but mostly straight. Don't keep the stick in close to your body.\nHolding the stick properly and learning to move with it can be the difference between a great skater and a great hockey player. You won't be very effective on the ice if you can't use the hockey stick.\n\n, As in basketball and soccer, you've got to learn to \"dribble\" the puck, moving it around as you skate to make it more difficult for the opposing players to take it from you. Practice shuffling the puck back and forth in front of you and to each side of you without moving your feet. Keep your eyes up and try to feel the puck without looking down at it.\n\n\nSurprisingly, your control of the stick comes from your non-dominant hand, the one higher on the stick, not the lower hand that you write with. Learn to control the stick with your wrist, making gentle but quick movements with the puck to control it.\n\n, Imagine your hockey stick as a leg and foot. To pass, you want the puck to roll off your hockey blade from the heel to the toe, using a sweeping motion to roll the puck, rather than stabbing at it. Follow through by completing the sweep of the stick after the puck has left your possession.Don't slap the puck when passing. One of the biggest misconceptions about playing ice hockey is that the best way to move the puck around the ice is to slap at it widely. While a slap shot is appropriate in some cases, passes require that you use more finesse on the puck.\n\n, When you first hop on the ice, it's hard to learn to cushion the puck as it comes toward you. Angle the top of the blade of your hockey stick toward the ice slightly to create a pocket that you can use to trap the puck. Practice receiving hard passes without letting the puck bounce of your stick wildly and you'll be a valuable asset to your team.\n\n, To shoot, sweep the puck forward and flick your wrists at the last minute to give the puck it's momentum and thrust. Follow through by pointing the toe of your hockey stick where you want the puck to go.\n\n\nLike so many things, an accurate shot is all in the wrists. To develop your shots, learn to move your lower hand farther down the stick and position your body at a 45-degree angle to the net on your approach. As you bring the puck back, lower your shoulder and shift your weight to your back leg. Keep the puck as close to the middle of the blade as possible, and create the same kind of pocket you'd make to trap the puck after a pass. Then let it fly.\n\n, The coordinator of the offense and the defense, the center is the player who takes the face-offs and serves as the team leader on the ice. If you want to play center, you need to be a great skater and a smart hockey player with an eye for strategy. Coaches want the center to be the smartest, most talented, and most experienced player on the team.\n\n, There is perhaps no more difficult and iconic position in sports than the ice hockey goalie. Decked out in enough pads to stop an elephant, the goalie is sometimes all that stands between a wooden puck hurling 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km\/h) toward the back of the net. A good goalie has quick reflexes, great hand-eye coordination, and laser-vision.\n\n, The right and left wing are offensive players who work each side of the ice, playing physically and creatively, taking shots and scoring points. Wingmen need to be fast and accurate shooters who can scrap in the corners and work the boards.\n\n, Because hockey is so fluid and the players are able to traverse the ice so quickly, defensive hockey players are more involved in the offense than in soccer or other similarly-structured games. Still, the defensive players' primary goal is to mark-up on the opposing team's wingmen and disrupt their play, then feed the puck to their own wings.\n\n, As you start learning hockey, it's important to become a good all-around player. A good wingman is a lot more than a puck-hogger who can shoot the puck a million miles an hour. He also needs to play strategically, keeping the team working as a unit. Your hockey will be much better in general if you get a chance to see the ice from all the different positions.\n\n\nGoalie, on the other hand, is a full-time commitment. Usually, the goalie starts early and sticks to it for life to learn the tricks of the trade.\n\n, A good hockey player at any position has excellent vision, anticipating his or her teammates' motion and making crisp passes into space. It's hard to make accurate and intelligent passes if you've got your head glued to the ice. Keep your eyes up and look around.\n\n\nThis will come with time, after spending lots of time skating and practicing your puck control.\n\n, Your team shouldn't be a 6-headed monster chasing the puck around the ice. Spread out, moving to space and finding the right angles to make passes around the ice and moving your offense forward in an attempt to score.\n\n\nGood passes are more effective and essential to a team's success than the ability to juke out the defense and make hard shots all by yourself. You can't do this unless players move to space and get open.\n\n, Make smart passes and control the puck to give your team the best chance to win. The team that controls the puck controls the game.\n\n\nKeep the puck on the ice to eliminate the possibility of wild passes. Passes should be crisp, not hard, meaning that you need to try your best to control wild pucks that raise up off the surface of the ice. When shooting and passing, practice whipping the puck forward and avoiding dead-duck slaps.\n\n, Inexperienced hockey players have a tendency to tense up in gameplay when they get the puck, gripping onto the stick too tight and losing their fundamentals and ability to control the puck. Suddenly, their passes are wild and too hard, their puck control crazy, and their play not so great. Learn to relax. Breathe deeply and have fun.\n\n, The variety of skills required to be a good hockey player can take years to master and it helps to practice with other players and an experienced coach. Look for a league in your area that you can join to play recreationally, and learn the skills necessary to be a great hockey player.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119122}

{"text":" The size of a shuffleboard table can range anywhere from nine feet to twenty-two feet. Keep in mind the amount of space you have to build and store it. You wouldn\u2019t want to build a fourteen foot long table in a twelve foot shed. Remember you need at least two feet of additional space on each end of the table to actually play.\n\n\nThe size you decide on will affect what dimensions and plans you use for the playing surface, the bed and the legs.;\n, You can find dimensions for shuffleboard tables online. They can save time and help you avoid mistakes. Looks for plans that are detailed and that tell you exactly how long the table should be, the width of the box, and the height of the legs. Map out the dimensions of each board you use, if you make plans yourself. Find pre-made plans at http:\/\/www.zieglerworld.com\/shuffleboard-plans.htm.\n\n, While maple or oak will give you the most durable table, these materials may be too expensive. For something more moderately priced, consider using plywood and bamboo flooring for the surface, which can be just as good once it's sealed and polished. Use mahogany for the trim, if you want a classic touch., The sides of the box should be sturdy, and if you can afford solid wood, that is best, but you can use many types of wood. Place your board on top of a saw horse so that the cut is made perpendicular to where you're standing. Clamp a metal straightedge, or a straight board, down to use as a guide. Carefully run your circular saw over the area you want cut.Remember you will need room for gutters. The box should be six inches longer on each end and several inches wider than the surface.\nBecause the boards square up the box, take extreme caution when cutting them. Adding any boards that are cut incorrectly will result in an uneven playing surface., Line boards up along the edges of each other to make a box frame. Pre-drill holes, if you\u2019re using a softer wood like pine. This will prevent wood splitting. Use wood screws around the edges of the box to fasten them together., Because your table will be long, it is important to support the length of the box with additional boards to keep the wood from bending. Reinforce the sides by laying boards perpendicular to the length of the box. Space strips of board about a foot apart and place them towards the underside of the box. Secure them with wood screws along the sides.\n\n, Use sheets of plywood cut to the correct dimensions to lay over the supports. Fasten the plywood together with mending plates. Drill wood screws through the plywood and some of the supports. There\u2019s no need to drill through every support. Use just enough screws to attach the plywood., The carpet in the box will look nice, when the playing surface is laid, and it will catch and soften the blow of pucks during a lively game. Cut the carpet into pieces for the bottom and each side. Staple away to attach it to the wood.\n\n\nTry to use a powerful staple gun for this job.\nLook into battery operated guns, which may staple a bit stronger than manual ones.\n\n, The top of the playing surface should be about three feet from the ground. Remember the rest of the table will be laying on the legs though. Adjust the length of the legs to the correct dimensions of the overall table and cut them accordingly.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re building a table around sixteen feet or longer, additional legs will be needed to support the weight.\n\n, Instead of screwing legs directly into the bottom of your box, attach them to separate boards first. This will further stabilize your shuffleboard table. You can use pieces of pine wood cut to the width of your box for each pair of legs. Drill screws into the boards to attach them to the legs., After you attach the legs to separate boards, you can simply attach the boards to the underside of the box. Position where you want the legs to be on the box, and drill into the boards to attach them.\n\n, You may need something to hold your playing surface up. You can use nuts, bolts and rails to float the game board on. Drill holes on each end of the box from the bottom. Cut through carpet with a razor blade before you drill. Screw a bolt from the bottom so that it shows through the box. Place a rail or tie bar on top of the screw and secure it with bolts.\n\n, Whatever wood you decide to use for the surface, inspect it for any knicks, warping or surface imperfections. Use your level to determine if it\u2019s even. Sand any trouble areas down, until the surface is smooth.\n\n, Since wood is unlikely to come in a piece as long as you need it, you will have to adhere sheets together for the playing board. Join two sheets together by first cutting the edges with a biscuit joiner. Have a biscuit ready, cover it in glue, and place it between the cut edges. As it dries, the glue expands, giving you a solid connection where the edges meet., Prevent the area you joined together from detaching by reinforcing it with board on the underside of the surface. You can use whatever board you have handy for this. Pine is inexpensive. Flip your surface upside down, cut a strip of board the width of your surface, cover the seam where the surface joins, and drill the board down.\n\n, Whether you choose to use paint or stain will depend a lot on what type of wood you chose. If you braved working with a traditional solid maple surface, you will want to use stain. If you decided on MDF, use an opaque, oil-based paint to help make it more durable. Use either a water-based or oil-based paint on plywood.\n\n, Consider drawing your game board using a felt tip pen or another fine drawing tool. Shuffleboard tables often allow for multiple types of scoring: lines in the standard game and circles in curling rules. Decide if you want to play using both scoring systems. Make sure paint on the surface is dry before drawing on it., You will need to seal the surface to protect it and allow for play. There are many types of polyurethane seal. What type of paint you used and how much time you have on your hands can point you in the right direction. An oil-based poly will take longer to dry, but can be more durable.\nDon't use oil-based over a white surface, because it can yellow over time.\nA water based poly dries quickly, but cannot be used over oil-based paint.\n\n, You should be able to lay your surface on the rail structure you built in the box. For additional support, use more screws, nuts and bolts in discreet areas.\n\n, Shuffleboard pucks should glide on the surface of your table. Wax it with furniture polish and buff with a soft cloth. Use silicone spray to extend the life of your waxing job and further seal the table.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119126}

{"text":" Dynamic stretching involves active movement, warming up your muscles for exercise. Avoid static stretches (holding a stretch) before exercise, as this does not prepare your body and may even decrease athletic performance.The rest of this section describes various dynamic stretches that are useful for volleyball players. You may go through all of them, or pick and choose the ones that seem to help most.;\n, A few minutes of light to moderate exercise will warm up your muscles. Maintain a moderate pace, but don't push yourself to the point of gasping or exhaustion.\n\n, Next, get some lateral lunges in to warm up for side-to-side movements. Make sure to avoid overextending your thigh muscles, keeping your knee directly above your toes.\n\n, Stand up straight with your feet at hip width apart. Jump from one foot to the other, lifting the other knee up to hip height.This will improve your hip flexibility.\n\n\nYou're doing this as a warm up, not an intense exercise. Stick to moderate speed.\n\n, Return to a low-intensity jog. Every couple steps, bring one of your feet backward to touch against your backside. Alternate feet as you do this.Don't push back with force. Make it a slight flick that brings your foot up for only a moment.\nThere is no need to bring your knee forward for this exercise. Keep your upper leg close to vertical.\n\n, Jump forward about 1.5 meters (5 feet), or less if necessary for a comfortable landing. Try to land as quietly as possible, then stand slowly. Repeat this exercise five times.\n\n, By now your muscles should be well warmed up. Add some leg flexibility with some targeted dynamic stretches, such as the leg swing:\n\n\nStand sideways to a wall and put your hand out against it for support.\nSwing the leg closest to the wall forward and back as high as you can. Do not hold your leg in an upright position.\nTurn around and put your other hand against the wall. Repeat with the other leg.\n\n, If your back is sore or tight, address that with a targeted exercise. Here's one option:\n\n\nLie flat on the ground with your arms straight out, in a T shape.\nSwing your leg toward your opposite arm, keeping both shoulders on the ground.\nReturn that leg immediately to the ground.\nRepeat the exercise with alternating legs.\n\n, Static stretches hold one of your muscles in an extended position. These exercises improve your flexibility and help your recovery after exercise. Read on for examples of these stretches, starting at the lower muscles and moving up.\n\n, Places your toes against a wall and your heel on the floor next to it, with your foot in a straight line. Push your heel down and lean toward the wall with that leg, with your other leg behind you for balance.\n\n, Sit down and place your left foot against your right knee. Lower your left knee to the ground, or as close to it as you can with moderate stretching. Reach for your right foot with your right hand and hold it for a few seconds. Repeat with your other foot.\n\n, Sit up straight with your legs outstretched. Bend one leg at the knee while keeping it flat, bringing that foot to the side of your body.

{"text":" With the exception a a few professional inline leagues, most inline hockey players do not wear shoulder pads because direct checking is not allowed, although, rubbing players into the boards is OK. There are players however, that feel more comfortable and protected wearing shoulder pads anyway. Another alternative to shoulder pads that many high level players wear, is a padded shirt. These are breathable stretch shirts with pieces of foam and hard plastic shells inserted. They offer good protection without having bulk of shoulder pads.(They are also socially accepted so you won't get chirped at. XD);\n, One piece of equipment a lot of inline players do not wear but should is a girdle or \"hockey pants.\" Inline girdles are more lightweight and cooler than ice girdles. There might not be legal checking, but this is still a contact sport and collisions are frequent. Most inline girdles have a jock built in and some even come with a cup.\n\n,, Shin guards are both recommended and required equipment. Ice hockey shin guards are more often than not exactly the same as inline, as in, shin guards are shin guards as long as they are designed for hockey. Hockey shin guards also provide knee protection unlike soccer shin guards for example, and are designed to take the impact of a puck as well as a stick.\n\n, Many players over the age of 18 prefer no extra face protection or wear a half shield. A full face cage or shield is highly recommended.\n\n,, Often times sticks from opposing players will get up on the hands, many times unintentionally. Gloves are the same as shin guards in the sense there is no difference between ice hockey and inline gloves.\n\n,, Inline Hockey skates for the most part, are ice hockey skates with wheels. If you are looking for skates, try them on first and see what feels comfortable to you. If you have the option, bake new skates. Baking skates helps them conform to the shape of your foot and much faster. This makes the breaking in process shorter and less painful. One mistake a lot of new or inexperienced skaters make is not tying their skates tight enough. Once you have the skates good a tight, pull them tighter. The tighter the skate the healthier for your ankles and knees but also, the better and faster you will be able to skate. Loose skates will be harder to stand on and when you take a stride will absorb the energy of your push whereas a tight skate will transfer that energy through the skate to the floor.\n\n, This is a matter a preference. Some people like to wear their shins over the tongue of their skates. Other players prefer to wear their shins under the tongue, or inside their skates.\n\n, Ice on the other hand calls for a bigger girdle so nothing is worn over it, instead hockey socks are worn to cover the shin guards. Some inline players also play ice and wear an ice girdle and hockey socks when playing inline. Other inline players wear shorts over their girdle and wear ice hockey socks. Wearing pants or socks is not important however, most leagues require you to cover all your pads.\n\n, The type of jersey you wear does not matter however, inline jerseys are much cooler than ice jerseys.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119132}

{"text":" While the standard player contract includes basic provisions for termination of the contract, an individual player's addendum may have additional clauses that address contract termination.For example, the SPK used in the NFL allows clubs to release players at any time. Since the NFL has salary caps and requires teams to pay fines for going over the salary cap, teams often release players so they can stay below the salary cap.\nA high-profile player may negotiate an addendum that specifies certain conditions must be met or that he is guaranteed a certain amount of money if he is released for such a reason.\nKeep in mind that teams normally are reluctant to make deals that guarantee money, because they have to pay that money even if they release the player \u2013 and that payout counts towards the team's total payroll for the purposes of the league's salary cap.;\n, Typically if a club plans to release a player the contract requires the club to provide that player of written notice that he or she is being released.For example, the SPK used in the NFL provides that a contract is terminated when the player receives written notice that his contract has been terminated.\nThe termination is effective on that day \u2013 there is no advance notice required under the SPK, although individual players are free to negotiate such conditions.\n\n, When the player is released, the club must pay that player any money he or she has earned in the current pay period, as well as any additional amount specified in the SPK or the player's addendum.For example, if the player is paid every other week during the season, and he is released mid-season, he would receive a paycheck for the days he'd been on the roster during that pay period before the date he was released.\nIn most cases, players aren't entitled to any money besides this once they are released.\nIn contrast to the NFL, professional baseball players are entitled to termination pay plus reasonable traveling expenses back to their home town if their clubs terminate their contracts.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119136}
{"text":" As the name suggests, a first baseman is responsible for watching the line between home plate and first base. Lots of balls get thrown toward first base, so get practice catching if you want play the position. You\u2019ll need to be skilled at keeping a foot on the base while also catching balls headed your way in order to make outs.First basemen need good focus, since the position gets action in many plays.\nIf you are tall, this can be to your advantage when choosing the first base position, since a first baseman has to catch a lot of balls.\nA strong throwing arm is less necessary for this position.;\n, These two positions often work together, so try your hand at both if you are interested in either. Shortstops and second baseman need to pay attention and think ahead when runners are on or headed toward bases, so that they are prepared to make a catch, touch a base, tag a runner, or get a ball to another baseman to make an out.Shortstops hover between second and third base, which means they need to be prepared for action. These players often have more movement than any other, so stay focused when you\u2019re trying out the position.\nOutfielders frequently throw balls to the shortstop, who relays them to one of the bases to make an out.\nA good throwing arm, speed, and agility are essential for both second basemen and shortstops.\n\n, Be prepared to see less frequent action when playing third base, since this position probably has less contact with the ball than the other infield positions. However, you\u2019ll need to work on your speed, because when your moment comes, you\u2019ll have to act fast to catch a ball and try to throw it all the way to first to try and get an out.Bunts and grounders often go to a third basemen, so concentrate on reacting to these if you are interested in the position.\n\n, Standing in the center of the field, pitchers get a lot of attention, but they have a tough job. Practice your throwing arm, since you\u2019ll need to throw pitches that are hard for the batter to hit--fast ones, but also curves, screwball, and others. Don\u2019t neglect your catching skills, either, because if you want to be a pitcher, you\u2019ll need to be ready for bunts, grounders, and popups., While it might look like the catcher doesn\u2019t move much, it's one of the most important positions. If you\u2019re a good leader, then try this position. You\u2019ll be facing your teammates, and have to be good at \u201ccalling the game.\u201d In particular, you\u2019ll have to work well with the pitcher, by signaling which type of pitch is needed.If you\u2019re an active player but not the best hitter, you might consider this position, since batting ability isn\u2019t necessarily considered a high priority for it.\nCatchers may also need to keep track of balls and strikes, and be ready to participate in infield plays when needed. If you\u2019re trying out for the catcher position, keep your mind on these skills as well., Though sometimes they get a bad name or are looked down on, outfield positions show their importance in critical moments of the game. There are three outfield positions, but the general skills needed for them overlap. Try one of the outfield positions if you\u2019re a great hitter but fielding isn\u2019t your strength.Center field needs to be prepared to cover a lot of ground. If any balls make it past the shortstop and second baseman, or to the wall, it\u2019ll be your job to go after them and get them back to the diamond to make an out.\nLeft field concentrates on the part of the field past third base. This position can have to handle a lot of hits, since so many hitters are right-handed.\nRight field will need a strong arm. If a deep ball comes your way, you may have to throw it all the way to third base, since the hitter will have had more run time.\nWhichever outfield position you try, be prepared to have less frequent action. On the other hand, you\u2019ll need to stay focused on the game for when your moment comes, and when it does, you\u2019ll have to act fast and cover a lot of ground.\n\n, Every player will benefit from being a strong and consistent hitter. Practice lots of swings so you\u2019ll be ready when it\u2019s your turn to step up to the plate.\n\n\nYour coach may develop a batting order based on hitting ability, but other factors come into play as well, so make sure to ask if you have questions.\n\n, To make the best choice, you\u2019ll have to have a good sense of what you excel at, and what you might need to improve on. Make some notes for yourself to rank your ability in critical skills, including:\n\n\nThrowing speed\nThrowing distance\nRunning speed\nReaction time\nCatching ability\n\n, You might have your heart set on a particular position. Baseball is a team sport, however, and a team is only strong if its members are in the right plays. Think about which skills you are good at, and choose a position that needs your strengths most of all, and allows you to work on your weaknesses outside of game time.For instance, you might think that you\u2019ve always wanted to be a shortstop, but have trouble getting balls to other basemen as quickly as the position requires.\nOn the other hand, maybe no one can touch your throwing distance. That means that right field might be the position for you. It will give you a chance to shine when you throw beautifully all the way across the field.\nYou can also work on making quick throws in practice time to improve on your weaker skill.\n\n, If you're interested in playing a particular position, your coach can work with you on how to improve, and try to give you practice at it. Or, if you\u2019re not sure of which position you want to concentrate on, talk to a coach about it. They can give you feedback and share observations about what your strengths might be so that you can make the right decision.\n\n, Good players will be able to give any position a try, and be better off for it. Though pros get a lot of attention for being a star in one position, coaches put value in \u201cutility players,\u201d those able to perform well in lots of different plays and positions. Experts also warn that overspecialization, especially when you\u2019re young, can actually hurt your playing ability.If you\u2019re unsure of what position to play, give them all a try!\nIf you\u2019re tired of playing one position, or want to expand your skill set, practice a new one!\nAsk your coach if you want to try something new.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119137}

{"text":" WAR is a simple representation of a series of highly complex equations. The concept was conceived by baseball statistician Sean Smith. It purports to measure the value of a player to his team, expressed in wins. You can find a player's WAR rating by following a 3-step process:\n\n\nCompile the player's single-season statistics in all pertinent categories for the season you're examining.\nDetermine the league average for each statistical category. You can only calculate WAR numbers after you've examined all players. A player's WAR is based on his figures compared to the league average, but is ultimately calculated against the projected statistics of a player who would replace him in his team's lineup. Replacement players usually have WAR ratings far below the league average.\nApply the player's statistics to those of the replacement player. After finding the difference in each category, take the sum of those figures and divide by 10. The quotient is the player's WAR rating.\n\n, These include:\n\n\nOPS+: Take the sum of the player's on-base percentage plus his slugging percentage, and compare the sum to the league average. The result yields a figure for batting runs above\/below average.\nBallpark and era adjustments: You must complete further detailed analysis to incorporate the characteristics of ballparks and style of play during the season you are analyzing. Do this by examining players' statistics at individual parks and comparing the figures to the league averages. These adjustments are extrapolated onto the player's batting runs figure for a final total.\nSpeed: You can judge an individual player's speed against the league average by measuring several different categories. Stolen bases, caught stealing, ground ball double plays, and extra bases taken all factor into this figure. You will have to examine play-by-play records to determine a player's effectiveness in taking extra bases. Compare the player's statistics to the league average in the other categories. The results yield a figure above or below the league average that you add to the batting runs number.\nFielding: Measure the player's defensive capabilities against the league average for putouts, assists and errors at his primary position. This produces a range figure. For infielders, add the range figure to the player's double-play number to arrive at a defensive number. Add the defensive number to the batting runs and speed numbers.\nPosition adjustment: Some positions are more difficult to play than others. This is considered in WAR ratings. For example, shortstops get a +8 adjustment to their WAR. Right fielders are -8. For a complete list, search online for WAR position adjustments.\n\n, To find the theoretical replacement player's rating, subtract 20 runs from the combined averages in the various categories.\n\n, Compare the rating of the player and the replacement player. Divide the difference by 10 to find the WAR rating of the player.\n\n, The key statistics for finding a pitcher's WAR rating are:\n\n\nEarned Run Average: Compare the pitcher's ERA to the league average.\nDefensive adjustment: Determine the defensive capabilities of the team that played behind the pitcher, compared to the rest of the league, and apply that figure to the pitcher's rating. This is done by comparing the fielding rating of each of the team's position players to the league average and applying that sum to the rating.\nFielding Independent Pitching: F.I.P. is a tally of the 3 categories pitchers control entirely: strikeouts, walks and home runs. F.I.P., combined with average innings per start, yields a figure that represents the number of runs a pitcher must save to qualify for a win. Find the pitcher's F.I.P. and compare it to the league average.\nPitcher's winning percentage above replacement: To find the pitcher's winning percentage, calculate the average number of innings per start. This number expresses how many runs the pitcher must save to qualify for a win. Subtract the league-average F.I.P. from the pitcher's F.I.P. and divide that result by the runs-saved number. This result will be expressed as a percentage. Add .500 to this figure to get the pitcher's winning percentage.\nUse a .380 winning percentage as the benchmark for comparison. Subtract the pitcher's winning percentage from this figure to get the result.;\n, Take the pitcher's adjusted winning percentage above replacement and multiply it by the number of innings pitched. Divide that product by 9 to render a number that expresses how many wins the pitcher is worth.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119142}
{"text":" Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10\u201311 inch (25.4\u201327.9\u00a0cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove.\n\n\nBefore playing regularly with your glove, it\u2019s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch.;\n, Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused.\nKeep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you.\nStand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed.\n\n, The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball\u2019s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dYou can\u2019t catch what you can\u2019t see,\u201dmeaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball.\n\n, Don\u2019t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it\u2019s your job to move to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment.\n\n\nIf the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down.\nWhen the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards.\n\n, Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher.

{"text":" Hits (also called base hits) are simply the sum of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.This statistic is easy to find online for professional players.\n\nYou can use the statistics for a season, a whole career, or any other period of time you're interested in. Just make sure all your statistics come from the same time frame.\n;\n, This is the number of times the player has made an attempt at an hit. This does not include walks, hits by pitch, or sacrifices, since these do not reflect the batter's offensive skill., The answer tells you the battering average, or the fraction of the time that a batter turned an at-bat attempt into a successful hit.\n\nFor example, if a player had 70 Hits and 200 At-Bats, his Batting Average is 70 \u00f7 200 = 0.350.\n\nYou can read a batting average of 0.350 as \"this player would expect to get 350 hits in 1000 at-bats.\"\n\n\n, Batting averages are almost always rounded this way. When a baseball fan mentions a batting average of \"three hundred,\" she means 0.300.\n\nYou can calculate batting averages to four or more decimal places, but this doesn't have much use beyond breaking ties.\n\n\n, A player's OBP tells you the fraction of the time that player makes it to a base, including walks and hits by pitch. Some fans consider this a better metric than battering average, since it takes into account all scoring methods. To find OBP, calculate Hits+Walks+HitsByPitchPlateAppearances{\\displaystyle {\\frac {Hits+Walks+HitsByPitch}{PlateAppearances}}}.This formula is good enough for most purposes, but it does count some uncommon plays that do not reflect on the batter's skill, such as sacrifice bunts and catcher's interferences. If you need to be precise, replace plate appearances with \"at-bats + walks + hits by pitch + sacrifice flies.\"\n\n\n, Runs batted in, or RBI, tell you how many times the team passed home plate due to this batter. For example, if there are two teammates on base and Sarah scores a home run, Sarah gets 3 RBI (two teammates + herself). This gives you a straightforward account of exactly how many runs a batter has scored. However, since it depends on other batters loading the bases, this statistic isn't a great way to compare players from different teams.\n\nDo not add to RBI if the at-bat led to a double play (two outs), or if a run only occurred due to an error., Slugging percentage is similar to a batting average, but counts the number of bases scored instead of just the number of hits. This rewards more powerful hitters who score more doubles, triples, and home runs. Slugging percentage equals Hits+Doubles+(2\u2217Triples)+(3\u2217HomeRuns)AtBats{\\displaystyle {\\frac {Hits+Doubles+(2*Triples)+(3*HomeRuns)}{AtBats}}}.You will get the same result if you count the bases in a more intuitive way: Singles + (2*Doubles) + (3*Triples) + (4*Home Runs). The formula above is usually easier to use since most baseball statistic websites do not list Singles.\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119144}

Keep on your new cap when you hit the gym, and try to get as sweaty as possible. Applying heat and moisture to a new hat is the easiest and fastest way to break it in, which is why sweating in your hat is perfect. Keep the hat on after you've finished your workout to allow it to morph to the shape of your head.\n\n, Wear your new cap while playing sports on your league or with a group of friends. This will cause you to sweat in your hat, but will also put the hat through some physical wear and tear (especially if you're playing sports like tackle football). It's called a baseball cap for a reason, so put it to good use!\n\n, Distressing the fabric and fading the color of your new cap can help to make it look more worn. Wearing the cap every day will help to naturally wear down the hat, but there are other things you can do to speed up the process.\n\n\nGet your hat dirty.

{"text":" Bats are available in both wood and metal versions, with the metal bats often made of titanium or aluminum. The grips on the bats may also be different, as well as the length. Typically, longer bats are appropriate for players who are a little taller, while shorter bats are easier for children or teenagers to manage effectively.;\n, Should the bat be for use by an amateur or professional baseball club, there are usually specific standards set by baseball leagues that help to determine the length and type of bats that can be used during a game. Obtain copies of those standards, and use them to focus attention on bats that are in compliance with those standards and regulations.\n\n, Most sporting goods stores and other outlets that sell baseball bats have access to a chart that takes into consideration factors such as age, gender and height to determine the ideal length and size of bat. Unless you are familiar with how to properly match the size of a bat with a player, making use of those charts is a good idea.\n\n, Like many other types of goods, quality will vary from one baseball bat manufacturer to another. Spend some time checking consumer reports and comments found at online forums regarding different makes and models. This will help you get a better idea if the bats made by certain companies are likely to hold up well or are not worth the asking price.\n\n, Many stores have floor models that can be tested for swinging, gripping and other basics involved in batting.

{"text":" First, refresh your knowledge on the game of baseball if necessary. You need to have a strong understanding of the strategies and mechanics of the game. It is valuable for an associate scout to know as much as possible about playing the game of baseball so he can relate to prospects.Baseball is in some ways a very technical sport, which means that baseball scouts need to have a keen eye and meticulous attention to detail. When you watch a game, practice the kind of behavior scouts do by paying attention to things like batting averages, running speeds, and pitching techniques.\nIf you find it helpful, read up, both with books and online, on the strategies and mechanics of baseball, as well as the statistics and attributes that go into determining what separates a good player from a great player.;\n, Although there are plenty of scouts who have little experience actually playing the game, it can certainly help. Playing baseball gives you the kind of first hand experience with how the game is played and what makes a good player that you can't get from just watching. Any experience with the game from the player's perspective is going to give you a leg up when it comes to analyzing them from the other side.You don't need years of semi-professional experience or a college baseball career. Look for a recreational baseball group in your city, or put one together yourself.\n\n, There exist courses that anyone can take that teach the foundations of how to be a scout. They are training programs designed specifically for a aspiring scouts. Search online to find scout courses near you.MLB has its own official scout school, but be aware that they only hold programs in a few states, and positions are limited.\n\n, Scouting baseball isn't a particularly glamorous job. It involves constant traveling, long periods away from home, waking up early, and an exhausting amount of work. Scouts have a lot of information in their heads when they're out on the job, everything from the names of coaches and players in their area to batting averages and pitching speeds. As a scout, you'll see endless hotel rooms, high school and college games, plane flights and rental cars. Your tools are nothing more than a radar gun, a notepad, and a wealth of knowledge about the minute details of what makes a baseball player great., The most significant difference between scouting high school players and scouting college players is that with high school players, a scout needs to be able to project their skills farther into the future. College players will have already enhanced their speed, strength, and skill, thanks to both more experience and better, more specialized coaches. That being said, high school scouting is the more important of the two, because the players you'll be watching in college will be the ones you identified as worth watching in high school., Many high up executives in the MLB were once scouts, and many started out as unpaid interns before that. Unpaid internships usually require little to no experience, which makes them an ideal first step into an organization like the MLB.You can search for internships online, or by simply going into the offices of nearby teams and asking if they're looking to fill any positions.\n\n, Find a baseball scout at local baseball games. They usually hold a radar gun, which is used to measure how fast a baseball is thrown, and carry items like clipboards or binders with the logo of their professional baseball team employer on them. Approach them and discuss your aspirations.\n\n\nGet into the habit of going to local games in leagues that scouts will be looking at, like amateur leagues, semi-professional leagues, and college baseball.\nAvoid coming on to strong. When you try to make a connection with a baseball scout, be aware that everyone is different, and some people are not going to open to helping out an aspiring scout. You'll need to be outgoing and friendly, and know when to cut your loses.\n\n, As associate scout is an unpaid position that reports to a baseball scout. The associate scout is responsible for providing the scout with information on a regular basis regarding baseball players in a designated geographic area. Associate scouts typically work in the areas in which they live.MLB its own career opportunities search engine on their official website. Check this regularly to see if any associate scout positions near you pop up.\nAnother option is to get to know scouts in your area, either by going to games and striking up conversations with them, or by making connections and networking from your internship with an organization. If you make your desire to become an associate scout clear, and you're a hard worker, you'll be noticed eventually.\n\n, As an associate scout, you will need to recognize players who have the skills required for professional baseball. Pay attention to advice from your supervising scout and read books on player evaluation. Your player evaluation skills are going to improve mostly through pure practice. By seeing batter after batter, pitcher after pitcher, and catcher after catcher, you'll slowly get better at noticing minute differences between their techniques, skills, and results.A scout has to know not just how to evaluate a player's current skills, but more importantly, how to see potential in player and project where their skills will end up. To do so, scouts judge position players in five basic areas, known as the five tools. A player who is great in all five tools is considered a five-tool player, and is a scout's dream.Those tools are:\n\nHitting average, which refers to how consistently a player can hit the ball and hit it accurately.\nHitting power, which refers to how high and far a player can hit the ball.\nFielding, which refers to a player's effectiveness on the field, his agility, footwork, and quick reaction time.\nArm strength, which refers to a player's strength when throwing a ball.\nSpeed, which refers to a player's running speed.\n\n\nWhen scouting pitchers, scouts always sit behind the home plate, so they can get a good view of the plate from the batter and pitcher's perspective. They look for velocity first and command of the ball second, because usually, command can be improved through training much further than velocity can.\n\n, Associate scouts need to report how players are progressing and describe the skills of new prospects in a timely fashion. You'll need to know the rating system for players inside and out. Scouts give two numbers for each category in their reports, one for their current rating, and one for their prospective future rating. Some of the categories scouts report on include hitting power, pitching velocity, fielding ability, and running speed.Scouts use a 20-80 scale to rate players on the five tools. Fifty and above is major league status. Scouts generally look for players who are above major league status in at least two of the five tools.For pitchers, scouts rate the player's velocity with each of their pitches, with their fastball being the most important. That's because fastball skill is much more innate, whereas one can improve one's skill with a curveball or changeup. In addition, scout's measure a player's command of the ball, and their control. Command is their ability to put the ball where the catcher wants it. Control is their ability to consistently hit the strike zone.\n\n, Show your supervising scout and the organization he works for that you've got what it takes to be a professional scout. Being good at making decisions, talking to people, digging up information, and being organized and aggressive could open up a paid position as an area scout.Understand that it could take a number of years to be promoted to an area scout because the positions open sporadically. In this position, you are responsible for reviewing all amateur baseball players in a geographical region, such as Oklahoma and Kansas or Northern Florida and Georgia.\n\n, Once you officially become a scout, there is room for advancement. If you continue to refine your ability to pick bright, young baseball stars, your next promotion could be to area supervisor and eventually national cross-checker. Keys to success include your ability as a scout, your passion for the job, how well you make connections within the industry, and your ambition for advancement.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119151}

You may choose from a variety of options depending on where you place your bet. Options typically include betting on moneylines, totals, runlines, and futures., Don\u2019t settle on just one place to bet, often called a sportsbook. Place different wagers at different sportsbooks to ensure you are getting the best odds. Seek out the sportsbook that will give you the best payout for your bet. Shop around to find the best payouts.If you find that a sportsbook in a casino 30 minutes away is paying 5 cents better than your favourite local sportsbook, it's best to go with the one 30 minutes away.\nMaximize your dollar. Join at least one betting exchange in addition to your favourite dimeline sportsbook. A betting exchange is similar to a sportsbook except players determine their own betting lines with one another. In other words, you will determine the payout with the person you are betting against.\n\n, Dimeline odds ensures that the odds on favorite and the underdog are separated by 10 cents on the dollar, thus the term dimeline. For example, if the favored team is given -150 odds, then a line of +140 will be given to the underdog, which is a 10 cent difference.If you choose the favourite the payout will be less than if you bet on the underdog to win. The team with the negative sign in front of it is the favourite. The team with the plus sign is the underdog. Dimelines work in your favour because the sportsbook can\u2019t over-shade the favourite without exposing themselves on the back side with a large underdog line. If a sportsbook offers 15 or 20 cent odds, the favourite and underdog will be separated by 15 or 20 cents. This puts you at a disadvantage so be weary. Choosing a dimeline book ensures that your winnings will be higher over the long term, regardless of who you bet.\n\n, Betting exchanges cut out the middle man and let bettors from around the world offer their own money lines directly to other bettors. This results in lines that are more favourable than any sportsbook.Additionally, a betting exchange won\u2019t straddle the line. This means it won\u2019t always separate the favourite and the underdog by exactly 10 or 20 cents. It may even be common to find no or almost no separation between the favourite and the underdog. You can\u2019t get better than equal odds.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119152}
{"text":" It's important to stretch out your body, especially your back, before you do a full twisting layout. Remember that, if you want to complete the full twisting layout, then you have to be able to do a round off, a back handspring, a back tuck, and a back layout. When you stretch, you should focus on your back and your wrists, though you should stretch your arms, neck, and legs as well. Here are some stretches you can do:\n\n\nDo a simple backbend to stretch your back.\nCurl up into a ball on the floor and roll up and down on your back, to roll it out.\nStretch your wrists and ankles by holding onto them and rolling them clockwise five times, and then rolling them in the opposite direction another five times.;\n, Back and front layouts are typically done after another skill that helps build momentum; to complete the full twisting layout most effectively, you should do a round off and then begin to do a back handspring, so that you generate enough speed and momentum to propel your body into the air for long enough to do a full twisting layout. Here's what you have to do:\n\n\nTo do a round off, here's what you need to do:\n\nHurtle forward with your arms up by your ears.\nPlace your hands down on the ground together.\nSwing your feet over your head.\nKeep your feet together until you plant them down on the other side of your hands.\nLand facing the opposite direction where you started from, with your arms up over your head, near your ears.\n\n\nTo do a back handspring immediately afterwards, you need to use the momentum of the roundoff to help you generate even more speed. Here's what you do:\n\nGet in a seated position with your arms swinging up over your head.\nPush through your toes to lift your arms up even more.\nFall backwards, taking care not to arch your back too much.\nPlant your hands on the floor, with your fingers facing away from you.\nSwing your legs over your hands, so you're in a hand stand for a second.\nKeep your feet together as you plant them on the floor.\nPop up with your hands above your head.\n\n\n\n, After you pound off the floor from your back handspring, your arms should pop up over your head. This is called the set, the move that helps you transition into the full twisting layout with the best form and speed possible.\n\n, In the hollowed-out position, your arms should be at your sides and your toes should be pointed. Remember that, just as in doing a regular back layout, you need to focus on achieving as much height as possible so you have time to complete the skill with your legs straight.\n\n, This will help you maintain your balance as you begin to twist. Your core (abdominal area) should be tight throughout this process.\n\n, Right when you start to see the ceiling, you should take your lead arm (whichever arm you're twisting towards), and drop it behind you, as if you were elbowing a person behind you. Take your other arm and bring it toward that arm, following the same direction you're twisting towards, as if you were passing a heavy ball you were holding with both hands to the person to the left of you. This will help your entire body complete the turn.\n\n, Then, open and lift your arms, remembering to keep your entire body straight. Extend your knees and ankles and continue to keep your core tight.\n\n, Once you have completed the rotation and are turned in the direction that you began the twist from, land on both feet and lift your arms up to complete the full-twisting layout. If you're not quite there and have only made it halfway around, then you can land in the opposite direction that you started from, doing the half twisting layout instead.\n\n\nIf you're having trouble reaching this point, you can work on improving your half-twist, even turning your body halfway after you land to get used to the sensation of making a full turn in the air.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119153}

A toe touch is a jump in which you jump up and spread your legs in the air, like a split, while touching your toes; a herkie is a jump in which one leg is stretched out in front of you while the other is bent at the knee and faces behind you.;\n, Stretching is a very important part of cheerleading. It loosens your muscles in preparation for jumps, tumbling, and stunts. Flexibility also plays a big part in which role you\u2019ll have on the team; the more flexible you are, the more versatile you\u2019ll be, allowing you to participate in tumbling, jumps, and stunts., Most cheers will be variations of the same movements. If you spend a bit of time learning the basics, such as a high V, low V, daggers, T, and broken T, you\u2019ll have an edge when it comes time to try out. Remember to keep your motions stiff.\n\nMake sure your arms are straight and your muscles are tense.\nKeep your joints (elbows, wrists) stiff and straight unless the motion requires them to be bent.\nFor most motions, your arms should be slightly in front of you.\nTighten your fists, and be sure to keep your thumbs on the outside of your fingers, not tucked in.\n\n, Learn how to do a cartwheel and a roundoff so you can show the coach your skills. If you have mastered those moves, try a back walkover, back handspring, or back tuck. Be careful, and don\u2019t try these moves alone if you have no experience. Tumbling is dangerous and you can easily hurt yourself if you don\u2019t have the right form., It\u2019s a great idea to learn a few basic jumps before tryouts. Try the toe touch and the herkie. Work on your form as well as the height of your jump., Find a dance or cheer routine online and practice it yourself. You will likely have to learn a dance as well as a few cheers at tryouts, so this will give you some experience. There are lots of tutorials online that will teach you how to do a routine step by step., Cheerleaders have to be both loud and clear. You\u2019ll need to speak from your diaphragm rather than your throat. Practice shouting a cheer while also carefully enunciating your words. If you don\u2019t know any cheers yet, just make one up.A great way to strengthen your voice is to lay on the floor on your stomach and grip your toes with your hands behind you. Try yelling or singing this way, and you\u2019ll see the way it exercises your diaphragm!\n\n, Cheerleading is a big commitment and you\u2019ll need to show your parents and the coach that you can handle it. Be sure to stay on top of your school work; complete all your homework, study for tests, and turn everything in on time. In most cases, cheerleaders need to achieve a certain GPA in order to stay on the team, so make your schoolwork a priority!, Cheer requires flexibility, strength, and endurance. You should go running, swimming, or lift weights to prepare for tryouts. Playing other sports will also help you get into shape, so join another team if you think you can handle it., Drink lots of water to stay hydrated. Be sure to eat a variety of foods, including protein, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. Stay away from salty and sugary snacks as well as soda and energy drinks., It\u2019s important to get eight to ten hours of sleep each night.Your body needs time to rest and recuperate, especially if you\u2019ve been exercising and working hard on learning the basics of cheerleading., Arrive on time and prepared for the tryout. Bring water and a snack for the break time. Avoid checking your phone or other distractions so you can show the coach that you will be a dedicated cheerleader., Be sure to smile and keep a positive attitude. Cheerleaders are known for their peppy personalities and energetic attitudes. If you make a mistake, move past it. Everyone is likely to mess up when learning something new. Simply smile and find your place, as this will show the coach that you don\u2019t give up when things are difficult., You should wear shorts and a t-shirt or tank top so that you can move freely. Wear sturdy sneakers or special cheerleading shoes if you have them. Braid your hair or put it up in a ponytail or bun to keep it off your face. Wear your school colors if you are able, and\/or add a ribbon in your school colors to your hair., Confidence is key for cheerleading. Even if you are new to the sport, if you learn a few basics before tryouts you can be confident in your skills. You should also be nice to others who are trying out and offer to help if you think you know something they can learn from., Give the coach your full attention at all times. It may be tempting to talk to your friends or others who are trying out, but you should show the coach respect. You\u2019ll also need to pay close attention to the instructions you are given so you can remember everything later., Don\u2019t be afraid to speak up if you have a question or would like some help with a move. Asking a question shows you want to understand, which is admirable. The coach will be likely be happy to explain something to you or help you adjust your movement., Give 100% during your tryout. Even if you feel silly or awkward, try your hardest to do what the coach asks of you. Though you may be new to the moves, the coach will appreciate your dedication and willingness to try., If the dance, cheers, or stunts are harder than you expected, or even if you don\u2019t make the squad, don\u2019t get discouraged. Practice the dance and cheers as much as you can before tryouts are over. If you don\u2019t make the team you can always work on your skills so that you will be more prepared the next year. Consider joining a dance team or a gymnastics team to improve your skills as well as have some fun. You could also try another sport.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119156}
{"text":" Learn these before you try a crossover. You'll need to be able to dribble with both hands and pass the ball between them, without looking at the ball.;\n, The goal of the crossover is to fool the defending player so you can slip past. If you plan to move to the left, start by dribbling with your right hand. If you plan to move to the right, dribble on your left side instead.\n\n\nDribble hard to keep possession. The ball should return to your hand right away after it hits the floor.\nThis is most convincing when you start out on your best side, dribbling with your dominant hand.\n\n, For this trick to work, you have to sell it with your body language. Keep your eyes focused in the direction you don't plan on moving. Keep your feet and shoulders aligned toward that direction as well, but be ready to pivot at a moment's notice.\n\n\nMake occasional eye contact with the defender.\nKeep your knees bent. Straight legs will slow you down.\n\n, Hesitate for a split second, then make a tiny lunge in the direction you've been looking. Ideally, the defender will reflexively move to block you, leaving him off-balance.\n\n\nLift the leg on the side you're pretending to move.\n\n, When the defender moves toward you, reverse the feinting motion. Drop the ball down out of their reach, and hunch low to the ground. The ball should land directly below your nose. For the rest of the crossover, the ball should remain below your waist, and preferably below your knees.\n\n, Keeping your hands below your waist, cross the ball to your undefended side. You can either pass the ball between your legs, or just in front of your knee. Keep your head up as you do this.\n\n\nThis is the most difficult part of the crossover. Practice while standing still, with your legs apart and your eyes on the ball. Once you've mastered that, practice with your eyes straight ahead. Finish by practicing while jogging, then running.\n\n, The hand that was originally dribbling should follow through after passing, barely touching your opposite knee. If you can make this part of one, smooth motion with the crossover, you probably have the correct technique.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119199}
{"text":" Curving a soccer ball is actually a lot harder to do than you might think. This will require plenty of ongoing practice, preferably with friends or other team players.\n,,, If you want it to swerve to the right, kick the ball on the left side and vice versa for swerving it to the left. It is much easier to start out with curving the ball to the left.\n\n, Aim for a bottom-right panel on the ball. Place your planting foot (left foot if you kick with right, and vice versa) at a 45 degree angle towards the ball. Take your footwear off and look at your foot. Feel the inside of your shooting foot. Feel just below the end of your big toe bone. Now move another 3\u20444 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5\u00a0cm) towards your ankle. This is where you should make contact with the ball. When you actually kick, your kicking foot should wrapped around to the left side of your body (for righties).\n\n\nHit the ball with the inside of your foot. When smacking the ball with the inside of the foot, be sure to follow through with your foot.\n\n,, Step 7.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":119200}
