{"text":"Cooling towers in a nuclear power plant are cylindrical or hyperboloid in shape, and their design serves a crucial function in the power plant's cooling system. These cooling towers are responsible for removing excess heat from the nuclear power plant's water-cooling system, which operates at high temperatures due to the heat generated from the nuclear fuel rods inside the reactor.\n\nThe shape of the cooling tower is designed to maximize the efficiency of the cooling process while minimizing the usage of water. The cylindrical or hyperboloid shape allows for the optimal distribution of water, ensuring that maximum surface area of the water is exposed to the air, this process facilitates evaporation, which cools the water and brings it down to a lower temperature. The design also promotes proper air circulation, maximizing the exposure of hot water to cooler air, therefore allowing the cooling process to occur more efficiently. \n\nFurthermore, the process of rapid evaporation produces plumes of water vapor, these plumes circulate air through the tower, allowing the cool air to reach the bottom and the hot air to escape at the top, this process is called natural draft cooling. The process of evaporative cooling is also more efficient in reducing the amount of water needed for the plant's operation.\n\nTo sum up, the shape of the cooling tower in a nuclear power plant is designed for optimum exposure of hot water to cooler air, to foster efficient cooling, ensure proper circulation of water and air, and minimize water usage; all factors that are necessary for an effective cooling system.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26792}
{"text":"Mitochondria are small organelles in eukaryotic cells that play an essential role in energy production through the process of oxidative phosphorylation. They are thought to have originated from ancient bacteria that were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells but were not digested. As a result, they formed a symbiotic relationship with the host cell. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the cell's nuclear DNA. The DNA present in mitochondria is circular, like that of bacteria, and contains genes that code for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. \n\nThe reason why mitochondria need their own DNA is primarily due to their evolutionary history. Mitochondria are believed to have evolved from free-living bacteria and gradually lost most of their genes as they integrated into the host cell. Nevertheless, they retained a small subset of genes involved in their own replication and energy production. Thus, mitochondrial DNA plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of mitochondria. \n\nAnother reason why mitochondria need their own DNA is that they possess a unique genetic system that differs from the cell's nuclear DNA. The mitochondrial genome is maternally inherited and is present in multiple copies within each cell. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can cause a variety of diseases due to a decrease in energy production or impaired mitochondrial function. These types of diseases can be inherited or may be spontaneous mutations that occur during cell division.\n\nIn summary, the mitochondria's origin as an endosymbiont explains the need for them to have retained their own DNA, which is critical for their proper functioning. Mitochondrial DNA also possesses a unique genetic system and plays a vital role in energy production. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA can lead to a variety of diseases that are especially problematic due to the vital importance of mitochondria in the cell's energy metabolism.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26793}
{"text":"Prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), are progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins in the brain. Prion proteins are normally found in healthy individuals, but in prion diseases, the prion protein adopts an abnormal conformational shape, known as the beta-sheet-rich isoform PrPSc, which is resistant to degradation and accumulates in the brain. The mechanism by which prion proteins cause normal copies to misfold is still not fully understood, but it is known that the misfolded PrPSc isoform can act as a template for the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the disease-causing isoform.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to the propagation of PrPSc in the brain. First, the beta-sheet-rich structure of PrPSc facilitates the formation of amyloid fibrils, which are oligomeric aggregates of misfolded prion proteins that can interact with and induce the misfolding of PrPC. Second, prion proteins are highly abundant in the brain, and the normal physiological turnover of PrPC can provide a constant supply of substrate for conversion to PrPSc. Third, there are a number of molecular chaperones and co-chaperones that normally assist in the folding and stability of proteins, including prion proteins. However, in prion diseases, these chaperones can be overwhelmed by the persistent presence of misfolded PrPSc, leading to a self-perpetuating cascade of prion propagation and misfolding.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that prion proteins can undergo a conformational change from a \u2018sensitive\u2019 state into a \u2018resistant\u2019 state, which is more prone to misfolding. In this model, the conformational change is triggered by changes in the environment, such as pH or temperature, as well as by contact with PrPSc. Once PrPC adopts this \u2018resistant\u2019 state, it can spontaneously misfold into the PrPSc isoform in the absence of any external template. This suggests that prion proteins may have an inherent tendency towards misfolding, which can be exacerbated by interactions with the pathological isoform, leading to self-propagation and accumulation of the misfolded protein.\n\nIn summary, the exact mechanism by which prion proteins cause a normal copy to misfold is still not fully understood. However, it is clear that the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is a complex process that involves interactions between the pathological and normal isoforms of the protein, as well as a range of cellular factors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying prion propagation and misfolding is critical for the development of effective treatments for prion diseases.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26794}
{"text":"Sticky is a term that is used to describe the adhesive properties of an object or surface. It is the property of attracting and sticking to other things when they come in contact with each other. The stickiness of an object or surface is determined by the type of adhesive material it possesses and its physical and chemical properties.\n\nThe adhesive material in sticky substances can be either natural or synthetic. In natural substances, the sticky properties are derived from naturally occurring substances, such as tree sap or honey. Synthetic sticky substances are created through chemical reactions in the laboratory. These substances can be tailored to exhibit specific properties that make them more effective as adhesives.\n\nThe stickiness of a substance depends on its surface energy and its ability to make contact with other surfaces. The surface energy of a substance is the amount of energy required to break the surface of the substance. The more energy required, the less likely the substance will stick. On the other hand, substances with a lower surface energy are more likely to stick to other objects.\n\nStickiness is also influenced by the angle of impact and the force applied. When an object comes into contact with a sticky surface at an angle, the force of the contact is spread over a larger area, reducing the ability of the substance to stick. However, when the force is applied perpendicular to the surface, the adhesive material is more likely to stick.\n\nIn conclusion, stickiness is the property of attracting and sticking to other objects. It is determined by the type of adhesive material in the substance and its physical and chemical properties such as surface energy, angle of impact, and force applied. Understanding the mechanics of stickiness is crucial in developing effective adhesives for various applications in industries such as manufacturing, medicine, and construction.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26795}
{"text":"Well, when you have a really long thing like a 200 foot long railroad rail, it can bend and flex more than a short 5 foot piece. This is because the longer rail has more space to move around and change shape without breaking. Just like how a short stick is harder to bend than a long stick, a short rail is not as flexible as a long rail.\n\nAlso, the rail is made of metal, and metal is a material that can change shape when force is applied to it. The weight of the long rail itself makes it bend more easily, and when a train travels over it, the weight of the train also adds to the force that bends the rail. So when you have a really long section of rail, there is more force acting on it which makes it more flexible.\n\nNow, you might be wondering why they don't just make all rails longer to make them more flexible. Well, there are limits to how long a rail can be before it becomes impractical to transport and install. But engineers have figured out ways to make rails even more flexible by adjusting the shape and composition of the metal they are made from. So even though a long rail is more flexible than a short rail, technology is always improving to make them even better!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26796}

Therefore, it is not possible to estimate the life expectancy of the submarine and its crew in space. However, it is essential to understand the harsh conditions of space and the requirement for survival in such an environment.\n\nThe harsh conditions of space, including the vacuum, radiation, extreme temperatures, and lack of essential resources like food, water, and air, make it challenging for living beings to survive. Despite technological advancements, space travel is still an incredibly risky endeavor, especially for humans. The average time for a space mission is approximately six months, and astronauts have to be trained rigorously to handle the stress and isolation of being in space.\n\nTherefore, the question of how long a submarine and its crew could survive in space is not applicable. However, it is relevant to consider how long artificially designed structures, such as the International Space Station, can remain in space. The ISS has been continuously inhabited since November 2000, and its design and construction allow it to remain in space for at least until 2028. The functionality and lifespan of the station are dependent on the maintenance, repair, and replacement of essential parts.\n\nIn conclusion, the question regarding the life expectancy of submarines and their crew in space is irrelevant, as submarines are not designed for space travel.

{"text":"The task of naming and cataloging visible stars has been ongoing for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks and Babylonians identified thousands of stars and gave them individual names. The first comprehensive catalog of stars was compiled by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus around 129 BCE, which contained the positions and brightness of around 1,000 stars. Since then, numerous astronomers have compiled lists of stars with increasing precision and completeness.\n\nHowever, to answer the question of whether all visible stars have been named and cataloged, the answer is no. The immense size of the universe and the vast number of stars it contains make it impossible to have identified and named each one of them. In addition, new stars are constantly forming, and existing stars may change in brightness, position, or other characteristics, making it difficult to keep track of them all accurately.\n\nMoreover, while catalogs of visible stars exist, they are not completely uniform. Different catalogs may include different stars or may use different conventions for identifying them. Therefore, it is possible that some stars may have been cataloged or named in one catalog but not in another.\n\nNevertheless, efforts to name stars continue. For instance, in recent years, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has initiated programs to allow members of the public to name stars under certain conditions. These named stars are not officially recognized by the astronomical community, but they offer a way for individuals to feel connected to the vast universe above them.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in identifying and cataloging visible stars, the sheer size and complexity of space make it impossible to have named or cataloged them all accurately.

{"text":"Modern locomotives are powered by diesel generators that, in turn, power electric motors for a number of reasons. Firstly, this design is more efficient and powerful than traditional direct mechanical or hydraulic systems. \n\nIn a direct mechanical system, the engine is connected to the wheels through gears and shafts. This often leads to a significant loss of power and efficiency as the engine has to work harder to overcome the resistance caused by friction and other factors. On the other hand, hydraulic systems use fluid power to transfer energy from the engine to the wheels. While this method is relatively efficient, it requires a complex network of pipes and pumps that can be difficult to maintain.\n\nIn contrast, the use of diesel generators and electric motors allows for greater control over the locomotive's power output. The generator produces electricity that can be used to power the motor, which in turn drives the wheels. This system enables greater precision and control over the locomotive's speed and power output, as well as reducing the risk of breakdowns and maintenance issues. Additionally, electric motors are capable of generating more torque than traditional mechanical or hydraulic systems, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications such as locomotives.\n\nOverall, the use of diesel generators and electric motors offers significant advantages over traditional systems.

This value is widely known as 299,792,458 meters per second or approximately 186,282 miles per second.\n\nOne of the most important contributions to the discovery of the speed of light was made by the famous scientist Galileo Galilei, who first made a serious attempt to measure the speed of light in the early 1600s. However, the first successful measurement of the speed of light was not achieved until the late 1800s, by the French physicist, Hippolyte Fizeau.\n\nIn modern times, it is understood that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is considered as one of the fundamental pillars of physics. The reason why the speed of light is constant has been attributed to the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave, which moves at a constant speed in free space. This movement is fixed by the properties of the electromagnetic waves and the vacuum, which are the fundamental characteristics of the universe.\n\nThe speed of light has an enormous impact in multiple areas of science. For example, it plays a critical role in astronomy, as it provides us with information about distant objects in the universe. Additionally, it has significant implications for the study of particle physics, where the interactions between particles are mediated by the exchange of particles known as bosons.\n\nIn summary, the speed of light is an incredibly important value in the field of physics. Although the reasons behind its value are believed to be rooted in the nature of electromagnetic waves and the vacuum, it has a significant impact on many areas of scientific inquiry.

{"text":"The reason why 50\u00b0 Celsius weather is unbearable while a tub of 50\u00b0 water is relaxing is due to the different ways our bodies perceive temperature in different environments. \n\nWhen we are exposed to high temperatures in the environment, like during a heatwave, our bodies work to maintain a stable core body temperature of around 37\u00b0C. The ambient air temperature affects our body's ability to dissipate heat through sweat and evaporation. However, when our body's ability to regulate temperature is overwhelmed, we can become heat-stressed, leading to symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and headache.\n\nOn the other hand, when we submerge ourselves in a tub of warm water, the water's heat transfers to our body, causing our blood vessels to dilate, allowing for better blood flow and reducing muscle tension. Our bodies are also better equipped to regulate temperature in a submerged environment, allowing us to tolerate higher temperatures in the water than outside of it. This is known as the \"thermal grill illusion.\"\n\nMoreover, the sensory stimulation we experience while soaking in warm water can also impact our psychological state, leading to feelings of relaxation and calmness.\n\nIn conclusion, although 50\u00b0 Celsius weather is unbearable, sitting in a 50\u00b0 water tub is a relaxing and therapeutic experience. Our body's capacity to regulate temperature, blood flow, and the sensory experiences we encounter in a submerged environment all contribute to our enjoyment of warm water.

That's because electricity flows from the hot prong into our appliances, and on its way back out, it goes through the neutral prong.\n\nSo, why are they different sizes? Well, it's actually a safety feature! You see, if you plug something in the wrong way, so that the appliance is connected to the neutral wire first, and the hot wire second, it can be dangerous. For example, imagine if you had a lamp with a metal lampshade, and you touched the metal while it was connected the wrong way. You would get an electric shock!\n\nBy making the neutral prong wider, it ensures that you can only ever plug your appliance in the right way - with the neutral wire connected first, and the hot wire second.

{"text":"There are several factors that may contribute to the difference in voice pitch between your English and Alemannic German speech. Firstly, the phonetic structure of each language may influence how you produce speech sounds. For example, English has a higher frequency of vowels that require a lower position of the tongue in the mouth than in Alemannic German. This may contribute to a higher pitch in English due to the increased tension in the vocal cords required to achieve those vowels.\n\nAdditionally, language and culture can influence the way we express ourselves through speech. It may be that your cultural upbringing has instilled in you certain gender norms or vocal expectations for speech in your native tongue. In contrast, English-speaking cultures may have different expectations for vocal expression and range.\n\nFurthermore, the social context in which you are speaking each language may also play a role. For example, you may feel more confident or expressive when speaking in Alemannic German with familiar people or in familiar settings, leading to a lower vocal pitch. In contrast, when speaking English in more formal or professional settings, you may feel the need to modify your speech in order to conform to cultural norms of politeness or professionalism.\n\nOverall, the difference in voice pitch between your English and Alemannic German speech may be due to a combination of linguistic, cultural, and social factors that influence the way you produce speech and express yourself vocally.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26805}
{"text":"When it rains, flies and other flying insects often dodge raindrops by seeking shelter under leaves or other structures. However, some insects, such as mosquitoes, are unable to dodge raindrops and are knocked out of the air. While it may seem like each impact is like being hit by a gigantic missile of water, it\u2019s important to note that these impacts are unlikely to cause any harm to most insects.\n\nThis is largely due to the fact that insects are small and lightweight, meaning that they are easily moved by raindrops and don\u2019t experience the same level of force as larger objects. In addition, insects are able to absorb the impact of raindrops using their flexible exoskeletons. This allows them to flex and bend in response to the impact, minimizing the force of the impact and preventing damage.\n\nDespite this, there are some circumstances where raindrops can be harmful to insects. For example, heavy rain can cause flooding which can drown insects or displace them from their habitat. Additionally, extremely heavy rain can cause erosion or landslides, which can severely damage insect habitats and reduce their populations.\n\nOverall, while insects may not be able to completely dodge raindrops, they have adapted to withstand the impact and minimize any potential harm.

{"text":"The process by which a light bulb \u201cburns out\u201d is largely due to the gradual deterioration of the filament inside the bulb. A light bulb relies on electrical energy to heat up a thin wire filament, typically made of tungsten, to an extremely high temperature which then emits light. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb filled with an inert gas, most commonly nitrogen or argon, that is sealed to prevent oxidation and combustion. \n\nAs electricity passes through the filament, it generates heat which causes the tungsten filament to glow and emit light. However, this process also leads to the gradual degradation of the filament, known as evaporation, which is caused by oxidation and is evident in the blackening of the filament.\n\nThe evaporation of the filament material causes the filament to become thinner and weaker, which in turn causes it to glow less brightly with time. Eventually, the filament becomes so thin that it breaks under its own weight or that of the surrounding parts, leading to a complete loss of electrical continuity in the circuit and the bulb stops working altogether, often referred to as \u201cburning out\u201d. Moreover, the sealed gas environment of the bulb that initially sustains the glowing filament ultimately also contributes to the \u201cburning out\u201d process, as the filament gradually deposits on the inner surface of the bulb and eventually diminishes its electrical conductivity.  \n\nIn conclusion, the process of \u201cburning out\u201d in a light bulb is a result of the gradual deterioration of the filament caused by the heat generated from the passing electrical current, the oxidation of the filament, and the deposition of the filament material on the inner surface of the bulb.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26807}

{"text":"The Sun is an enormous, intensely hot celestial object, made up of a combination of gases that eventually reaches the surface of the Sun known as the photosphere. Temperature is essentially a measure of kinetic energy, and the higher the temperature, the greater the speed at which particles collide. Therefore, the temperature at any point closer to the Sun is hotter than it is from a point further away.\n\nThe Sun produces heat and light via a process known as nuclear fusion, where hydrogen fuses together to form helium, which leads to the release of an enormous amount of energy. This energy escapes as light and heat, and the light, known as electromagnetic radiation, then travels through the vacuum of space.\n\nAlthough there is no medium to transfer the heat, electromagnetic radiation travels as waves of energy. These waves can be absorbed or reflected by matter in its path, such as the Earth's atmosphere, but in the vacuum of space, the electromagnetic radiation travels unimpeded by any intervening matter.\n\nThe temperature tends to decrease as the distance from the Sun increases because the intensity of the radiation decreases with increasing distance. This is a result of the inverse-square law, which states that as you move further away from a source of light, the intensity of that light decreases in proportion to the square of the distance. Therefore, the further away you get from the Sun, the less intense the radiation will be that reaches you.\n\nIn conclusion, the closer one gets to the Sun, the hotter it gets because of the intense heat and light produced by nuclear fusion, and the distance from the Sun affects the intensity of the radiation. Even though there is no medium to transfer the heat, electromagnetic radiation travels as waves of energy through the vacuum of space.

{"text":"The global spread of solar panels is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, and it does have the potential to somewhat lower temperatures globally. Solar panels work by converting sunlight into electricity. In doing so, they absorb some of the heat energy that would otherwise reflect back into space. However, the amount of heat absorbed by solar panels is minuscule compared to the amount of incoming solar radiation that reaches Earth's surface. Thus, although solar panels are effective in capturing sunlight, they do not actually significantly absorb enough heat to have a substantial climate change impact.\n\nMoreover, it's worth noting that the heat reflected by solar panels is only a fraction of the total amount of solar radiation. A significant portion of the solar energy that reaches Earth is reflected by the planet's surface and by clouds. Therefore, solar panels (even if they were spread widely and used universally) would only affect a small part of Earth's climate system.\n\nIn conclusion, while the widespread adoption of solar panels may have small-scale benefits in mitigating global warming, it is important to recognize that they alone cannot significantly lower Earth's temperature.

That's because there's also a force called the strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. It's much stronger than the electromagnetic force, so the protons and neutrons stick together.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the charges of protons and electrons are perfectly opposite to each other because of the fundamental forces of the universe. It's what allows atoms to exist, and therefore, life as we know it!","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26814}
{"text":"Quantum computing is a novel and intriguing development in the realm of computer science. It is a type of computing that relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, and its performance is expected to surpass that of classical computing in areas such as cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence. A fundamental feature of quantum computing is the use of qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows for the creation of quantum algorithms that can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical algorithms. \n\nOne of the common misconceptions about quantum computing is the idea that a quantum computer tries all the solutions at once. While it is true that a quantum computer can examine multiple inputs simultaneously, it is not trying all the solutions at once. Instead, it leverages the principles of superposition and entanglement to search through all possible solutions in a highly efficient manner. \n\nSuperposition is the idea that a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously. In the context of quantum computing, this means that qubits can be in both the 0 and 1 state simultaneously. Superposition allows for the creation of quantum algorithms that can examine multiple inputs simultaneously. \n\nEntanglement is a phenomenon where two particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other particle. This effect can be used to create quantum algorithms that can search through all possible solutions in parallel. \n\nThrough a process called quantum interference, a quantum computer can eliminate all incorrect solutions, leaving only the correct one. Quantum interference is the result of the interaction between quantum states and is fundamental to the operation of quantum algorithms. By adjusting the phases of the quantum states, a quantum computer can amplify the correct solution and cancel out all the incorrect ones. \n\nIn summary, a quantum computer doesn't try all the solutions at once. Instead, it uses the principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference to search through all possible solutions in a highly efficient manner. By canceling out all the incorrect solutions, it identifies the correct one. This unique approach to computing has the potential to revolutionize several domains of science and technology, with applications ranging from drug discovery to climate modeling.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26815}
{"text":"The shape of the iris, the pigmented muscles surrounding the pupil, determines the shape of the pupil and how it responds to light. The shape of the pupil, in turn, determines the amount of light that enters the eye and helps to create a sharp image on the retina. The difference in eye morphology between domestic house cats and their larger wild relatives, such as lions, tigers, cheetahs, and leopards, leads to their different shaped pupils.\n\nDomestic house cats evolved from African wildcats, which have vertically elongated pupils that narrow into a slit in bright light. The slit shape helps to minimize the amount of light that enters the eye in bright conditions, allowing the cat to better focus on nearby prey and avoid being dazzled. Additionally, the slit shape increases the depth of field of the cat's vision in the vertical axis, which is important for hunting small prey that move quickly across the ground.\n\nIn contrast, larger wild cats evolved different pupil shapes due to their diurnal hunting habits and large size. Lions, tigers, cheetahs, and leopards hunt during the day, which means they require a large aperture to gather sufficient light for their large eyes. A circular pupil provides more light and a wider field of view, which is important for spotting and tracking prey over long distances.\n\nOverall, the differences in pupil shape between domestic house cats and their larger wild relatives reflect their adaptation to different ecological niches and hunting strategies. While both types of cats have evolved to be expert hunters, their ocular morphology represents a key adaptation that allows them to effectively pursue prey in their respective environments.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26816}
{"text":"As an AI language model, I don't have a personal belief or opinion about this question. However, based on scientific facts and research, DNA is the universal genetic language of all life forms on Earth. It carries the genetic information that determines our individual characteristics and traits. While DNA is incredibly unique to each individual creature, it is believed to be formed from the same basic building blocks throughout the planet.\n\nThe question of whether DNA is unique only to Earth is both fascinating and complex. The universe indeed comprises vast galaxies filled with billions of stars and habitable planets that might support some form of life. It's possible that extraterrestrial life in other worlds might contain DNA-like molecules that function similarly to our DNA.\n\nScientists have already discovered organic molecules throughout our solar system, and several researches have shown that amino acids and RNA, the building blocks of DNA, can form under conditions like those on early Earth. Some scientists suggest that life may have similarly originated on other planets, which could have resulted in DNA being present in some form or another.\n\n Nonetheless, at this stage, there is no concrete evidence of any extraterrestrial DNA or life. However, as our technology improves, our chances of discovering life beyond Earth increases. Thus, until we have a more data-oriented approach to the matter, this question remains mysterious, leaving it up to scientists and avid explorers to unravel.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26817}
{"text":"The process of particles sloughing off and being detected by our nose is a complex interplay between various physical and chemical phenomena. In the case of waste in the toilet, for example, the particles are predominantly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are released due to the action of microbes on the waste. These VOCs are characterized by their low molecular weight and high vapor pressure, which allows them to evaporate readily into the air. Once in the air, they are carried upwards by natural convection currents and airflows, eventually reaching our noses.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of lip balm on our lips, the particles that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor are also typically VOCs that are volatile enough to evaporate into the air. However, the mechanism by which they reach our noses is slightly different. In this case, the particles are not released by microbes but are instead released by the lip balm itself due to chemical interactions with our skin. As we apply the balm, the volatile particles evaporate into the air and are carried upwards by the same convective air currents as before.\n\nIn conclusion, the process of particles sloughing off and being detected by our noses is a combination of various physical and chemical factors that act together to create the characteristic smells and flavors that we experience. These factors include the chemical composition of the particles themselves, the natural convective currents and airflows that carry them upwards, and the chemical interactions between the particles and our skin or other surfaces.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26818}
{"text":"Living on a planet with rings around it would be unlike anything we experience here on Earth. Imagine looking up at the sky and seeing a vibrant ring system, stretching from horizon to horizon, encircling a massive planet. The rings themselves would likely be made up of particles of ice, rock, and dust, ranging in size from tiny grains to larger boulders and chunks.\n\nOne of the most notable differences from living on Earth would be the amount of light that would be reflected off the rings. Because the rings would be so reflective, there would be an abundance of light, even at night, since the rings would reflect the light of the planet's sun. Depending on one's proximity to the ring system, the rings could also dominate the view in the sky, changing in appearance as the planet rotates, and shifting in hue as the sun moves across the sky.\n\nPerhaps the most significant effect of living on a ringed planet would be the impact on weather patterns. The presence of such a significant ring system would likely create its own weather patterns, with the particles in the rings absorbing and reflecting heat from the sun, and causing local temperature gradients and atmospheric disturbances. Additionally, the rings themselves could potentially create their own moons, as larger particles clump together and are gravitationally pulled into orbit.\n\nOverall, living on a planet with rings would be a fascinating experience, providing a unique and awe-inspiring view of the universe above. But it would also present some unique challenges, such as adapting to changing weather patterns, finding ways to navigate around the ring system, and dealing with potentially hazardous particles that could impact the planet's surface.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26819}
{"text":"Grapefruit is a delicious and nutritious fruit that is packed with vitamins and minerals; however, there are certain medications that should not be taken with it. The reason behind it is that grapefruit contains a compound called furanocoumarin, which affects the enzymes in our body responsible for metabolizing drugs. When consumed with certain medications, grapefruit can increase the concentration of the drug in the bloodstream, which can lead to serious side effects.\n\nThe medications that should not be taken with grapefruit include certain statins, such as simvastatin and atorvastatin, which are used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. Other medications that should be avoided when consuming grapefruit include certain blood pressure medications, antihistamines, and anti-anxiety drugs. These drugs are metabolized by the same enzymes that are affected by grapefruit, which can cause a dangerous buildup of the drug in the body.\n\nIt is important to note that not all medications interact with grapefruit, but if you are taking any medications, it is always a good idea to ask your doctor or pharmacist if consuming grapefruit is safe. If you are advised to avoid grapefruit, it is best to consume other fruits that are safe to eat with your medication. Overall, it is always important to follow your doctor or pharmacist's instructions when taking medications to avoid any side effects or interactions.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26820}
{"text":"A black hole is formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravitational pull, and the singularity, a point in space-time with infinite gravitational pull, is formed. While the singularity itself may be a 0-dimensional point, the event horizon, the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing can escape, is a 2-dimensional surface. This event horizon is also known as the Schwarzschild radius.\n\nRotation in a black hole is caused by the spin of the star before it collapsed and formed the black hole. If the star had a spin, the black hole would also have one. While there may not be an axis for the singularity to rotate around, the space-time around the black hole is distorted due to its mass and spin, creating a rotating disk of matter known as an accretion disk. This accretion disk is made up of gas, dust, and other debris that are pulled towards the black hole\u2019s event horizon, and as it gets closer, the material gets hotter and brighter. \n\nA black hole\u2019s rotation can also be measured by observing the Doppler shift of light. As the black hole rotates, the light emitted from the material in the accretion disk shifts in frequency due to the relative motion of the disk and the observer. This shift can provide insight into the black hole\u2019s properties, such as its mass and spin.\n\nIn summary, although the singularity may be a 0-dimensional point, the black hole\u2019s rotation can be observed through its accretion disk and the Doppler shift of light. The spin is caused by the rotation of the star before its collapse.","label":1,"model":"chatGPT","source":"reddit","id":26821}

{"text":"Richland High School is a public secondary school in the northwest United States, located in Richland, Washington. The school was founded as Columbia High School in 1910 to serve the educational needs of the small town of Richland. The building was replaced with a much larger structure by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1946 as the development of the neighboring Hanford Engineering Works brought an influx of employees to the region to support the war effort.\n\nColumbia High was renamed Richland High School as the small farming community continued to develop as weapons production climbed during the Cold War and the town was designated as a first class city in 1958. The facilities of were extensively renovated in 1964, and remodeled again in stages between 1995 and 2006. The school is now part of the Richland School District. Until the founding of Hanford Falcons in 1972, Richland High was the only high school in the city.\n\nRichland's mascot is the \"Bomber\", officially named for the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress built in Seattle, but also in recognition of the city's contributions as an \"Atomic City\" in World War Two. Hanford was home to the Manhattan Project's B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the nuclear bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan. Mushroom cloud logos are proudly displayed throughout the school and the student body used to shout \"nuke 'em\" at sporting events.\n\nIn 2019, \"Archie\" a B-17 Ball Turret Gunner was named the first-ever character mascot at Richland High School. The mascot is named after Archie Purcell, a WWII veteran who was a ball turret gunner on the famous B-17 \"A Days Pay\".\n\nAs the region has diversified since its past as a federally owned Atomic City where 90% of the population was either employed by or a dependent of Hanford, the school has since received criticism for its depiction of a mushroom cloud as an unofficial logo for the school, believing that the logo and the mascot to be a shameful reminder of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAthletics\n\nRichland High has an enrollment of roughly 2,000; its WIAA classification is 4A, for the state's largest schools. The football stadium, which is used for both Richland and Hanford High School events, is located immediately adjacent to the grounds of Richland High School, and was named Fran Rish Stadium in his honor in 1986.\n\nFootball\nThe Bombers were state champions in 1981, 1999, and 2017, and played in the title game in 1975, 1996, and 2016. The 2017 team was coached by Mike Neidhold, the 1999 team by Lonnie Pierson, and the 1981 team by J.D. Covington.\n\nCross country\nRichland was a cross country power in the early 1970s, winning a then-record five straight AAA state boys' titles under coaches Max Jensen (1970\u201372) and Mike Hepper (1973\u201374).  Jensen went on to be a successful coach at Spokane Community College.  The RHS girls' cross-country team won the state championship in 1993 under coach Mike Mills, and also qualified for state in 2005 and 2006.\n\nSoccer\nRHS has a very strong girls and boys soccer program. The 1999 state champion team, led by future United States World Cup and gold medal-winning goalkeeper Hope Solo, was undefeated and ranked fourth in the nation. Both the boys' and girls' team were state champions in 2003.\n\nOctavio DoValle Sr. has been the Richland High School boys soccer coach since 1987.  Under his direction, the soccer program built the first dedicated high school soccer stadium in the state.\n\nBaseball\nRichland High School's baseball team has been highly successful, winning four state titles in eleven years (1999, 2005, 2007, 2009), and another in 2018. This was especially impressive considering the football team had won state earlier in that same school year. Former coach Ben Jacobs is the winningest coach in school history with over 400 wins. One of Jacobs' notable alumni is Travis Buck of the Cleveland Indians, formerly of the Oakland Athletics.\n\nBasketball\nRichland has won three state championships in boys' basketball, most recently in 1979, a team led on the floor by Mark Hoke, Bob Kennedy, and Brian Kellerman. Previous state titles were in 1972   made the state semi-finals seven times in eight years in the 1970s, advancing to  In the 1960s, they won the third place game four times  Kellerman was a four-year starter at Idaho, a top ten team in 1982, and he was the Big Sky player of the year as a\n\nGolf \nRichland High School has had a strong boys golf program since the late 1960s. The Bombers won back to back state golf titles in 1968 and 1969.   RHS won three state championships in the span of five years between 2000 and 2005. In 2016 the school placed second in the state.\n\nAlumni\n\nJames Albaugh: Class of 1968 \u2013 former CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes\nKayla Barron: NASA astronaut, and submarine warfare officer.\nTravis Buck: Class of 2002 \u2013 MLB outfielder\nGene Conley: Class of 1948 \u2013 MLB pitcher and NBA forward\nLarry Coryell: Class of 1961 \u2013 musician, jazz fusion guitarist\nKathleen Flenniken: Class of 1978 \u2013 poet, Washington State Poet Laureate\nSantino Fontana: Class of 2000 \u2013 stage actor, director, and composer\nLiz Heaston: Class of 1997 \u2013 soccer and football, first woman to score a point in a college football game\nKurt Kafentzis: former NFL defensive back\nMark Kafentzis: former NFL defensive back\nBrian Kellerman: Class of 1979 - basketball player\nJohn Lesko: Class of 2006 \u2013 USSF Division 2 Professional League defender\nJames Mattis: Class of 1968 \u2013 USMC General, commander of U.S. Central Command, and Secretary of Defense\nJohn Meyers: Class of 1958 \u2013 NFL defensive tackle\nGreg Olson: Class of 1981 \u2013 NFL assistant coach\nMichael Peterson: Class of 1977 \u2013 singer, country singer\nLeon Rice: Class of 1981 \u2013 basketball coach at Boise State University\nKathryn Ruemmler \u2013 White House Counsel to President Barack Obama June 2011 \u2013 June 2014\nWestley Allan Dodd: Class of 1979 - American serial killer\nHope Solo: Class of 1999 \u2013 U.S. Soccer Federation and Women's Professional Soccer goalkeeper\nSharon Tate: Class of 1961 (attended) \u2013 actress\nMark Watrous: Class of 1996 \u2013 Guitarist for The Shins\nEric Yardley: Class of 2009 \u2013 MLB pitcher\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRichland, Washington\nHigh schools in Benton County, Washington\nTri-Cities, Washington\nEducational institutions established in 1910\nSchool buildings completed in 1910\nSchool buildings completed in 1944\nPublic high schools in Washington (state)\n1910 establishments in Washington (state)","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135401}
{"text":"Timur Kuran is a Turkish-American economist and political scientist, Professor of Economics and Political Science, and Gorter Family Professor of Islamic Studies at Duke University. His work spans economics, political science, history, and law.\n\nEarly life and education\nKuran was born in New York City in 1954, where his parents were graduate students at Yale University. They returned to Turkey, and he spent his early childhood in Ankara, where his father, Aptullah Kuran, taught at Middle East Technical University. The family moved to Istanbul in 1969, when the senior Kuran joined the faculty of Robert College, whose higher education side became Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University in 1971.\n\nKuran obtained his secondary education in Istanbul, graduating from Robert College in 1973. He went on to study economics at Princeton University, graduating magna cum laude in 1977. He obtained his doctorate at Stanford University, under the supervision of Kenneth Arrow.\n\nCareer\nKuran taught at University of Southern California between 1982 and 2007, where he held the King Faisal professorship in Islamic Thought and Culture from 1993 onwards. He moved to Duke University in 2007, as Gorter Family Professor of Islamic Studies and with a joint appointment in the departments of Economics and Political Science. \n\nKuran\u2019s visiting positions include: Institute for Advanced Study (1989-90), Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago; (1996-1997), Economics Department, Stanford University (2004-2005), Law School, Yale University (2020). \n\nFrom 2008 to 2014 Kuran served on the Executive Committee of the International Economic Association. He is a founding member of the Association for Analytic Learning about Islam and Muslim Societies (AALIMS), which he has directed since its establishment in 2011.\n\nKuran was the founding editor of the University of Michigan Press book series \u201cEconomics, Cognition, and Society\u201d (1989-2006). Since 2009, he been co-editor of the Cambridge University Press series \u201cCambridge Studies in Economics, Choice, and Society,\u201d which he co-founded with Peter Boettke. He has co-edited the Journal of Comparative Economics since 2017. \n\nKuran is a promoter of freedom of expression, within and outside academia. In 2021, he became a co-founding member of the Academic Freedom Alliance (AFA). In 2022, he joined the Advisory Council of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).\n\nResearch\nFour themes stand out in Timur Kuran\u2019s works: preference falsification, the roles of Islamic institutions in the economic performance of the Middle East, the economic agenda of contemporary Islamism, and the political legacies of Islamic institutions in the Middle East. The last three themes benefit from his passion for collecting Ottoman and Turkish documents.\n\nPreference falsification \n\nKuran coined the term preference falsification in a 1987 article to describe the act of misrepresenting one\u2019s wants under perceived social pressures. It involves tailoring one\u2019s expressed preferences to what appears socially acceptable or politically advantageous. His subsequent works argue that the phenomenon is ubiquitous and that it can have huge social, political, and economic consequences. The effects hinge on interdependencies between the personal preferences that individuals choose to express publicly. A broad statement of his argument is in Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification. This 1995 book explains how preference falsification shapes collective decisions, orients structural change, distorts human knowledge, and conceals political possibilities. \n\nAn April 1989 article by Kuran, \u201cSparks and prairie fires: A theory of unanticipated political revolution,\u201d presented the French Revolution (1789), the Russian Revolution (1917), and the Iranian Revolution (1979) as examples of events that stunned the world; and it explained how preference falsification, combined with interdependencies among publicly expressed preferences, keeps us from anticipating political earthquakes that are easily explained in retrospect. After the East European Revolutions of late 1989, Kuran explained why seasoned experts of the Communist Bloc were caught off guard in \u201cNow Out of Never: The Element of Surprise in the East European Revolution of 1989.\u201d These papers and Private Truths, Public Lies suggest that political revolutions and big shifts in public opinion will surprise the world repeatedly, because of people\u2019s readiness, under perceived social pressures, to conceal their political dispositions. \n\nKuran has used his theory to shed light on the persistence of East European communism despite its inefficiencies, why India\u2019s caste system has remained a powerful institution for millennia, transformations of American race relations, the aggravation of ethnic conflicts through a self-reinforcing process whereby ethnic symbols gain salience and practical significance, (with Cass Sunstein) the eruption of mass hysteria over minor risks, and American polarization.\n\nIslam and economic performance of the Middle East \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Kuran started exploring the drivers of the Middle East\u2019s economic trajectory from the birth of Islam to the present. His focus has been on the roles of Islamic law (Sharia) in shaping economic opportunities. \n\nDuring Islam\u2019s early centuries, Kuran observes, the economic content of Islamic law was well-suited to global economic conditions. As such, the Middle East was an economically advanced region. Subsequently, it failed to match the institutional transformation through which Western Europe vastly increased its capacity to pool resources, coordinate production, and conduct trade. Although the Middle East\u2019s economic institutions never froze, in certain areas central to economic modernization changes were minimal until the 1800s, at least in relation to structural transformations in the West.\u00a0\n\nThe Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East is Kuran\u2019s broadest account of this thesis. There, he suggests that several elements of Islamic law helped to turn the Middle East into an economic laggard. Because of its egalitarian character, the Islamic law of inheritance inhibited capital accumulation, and it curtailed needs for organizational innovations to scale up the pooling of capital and labor. The lack of an Islamic concept of corporation also hindered organizational development; in addition, it kept entrepreneurs politically weak. The waqf, Islam\u2019s distinct form of trust, locked vast resources into organizations prone to becoming dysfunctional.\n\nNone of these institutions were disadvantageous at their emergence, suggests Kuran; they solved identifiable problems. None caused an absolute decline in economic activity. Each became a handicap by perpetuating itself during the millennium when Western Europe spearheaded economic modernization.\n\nA popular argument is that Islam fosters a conservative ethos that promotes resistance to adaptation. Had conservatism per se made the Middle East fall behind, Kuran says, adjustments would have lagged across the board. But even as institutions of the private economy stalled, military and taxation systems were reformed repeatedly. That commercial and financial organizations were not scaled up points to an institutional trap, not conservative attitudes. Inefficient institutions perpetuated themselves as their interactions dampened incentives to innovate. When in the 1800s the rise of the West created an existential threat, institutional transplants followed. The borrowed institutions perform functions long met through Islamic institutions.\n\nThe Islamic institutions that delayed the Middle East\u2019s economic modernization no longer block economic development directly, claims Kuran. But patterns they fostered, including low trust in institutions, rampant corruption, and widespread nepotism, are impeding the region\u2019s catch-up.\n\nKuran\u2019s research on the Middle East\u2019s economic history draws on data collected from Istanbul\u2019s Islamic court archives. His data from the 1600s has been published as a ten-volume bilingual set.\n\nThe functions of Islamic economics \u00a0 \u00a0 \nKuran\u2019s research agenda has included exploring the origins, logic, and initiatives of Islamic economics, a doctrine that claims to offer an alternative to capitalism and socialism. Its initiatives include the establishment of Islamic financial institutions meant to avoid interest. It also promotes Islamic behavioral norms and has founded anti-poverty systems inspired by zakat practices in seventh-century Arabia, in Islam\u2019s earliest decades.\n\nTimur Kuran argues that the doctrine of Islamic economics is incoherent and largely irrelevant to present challenges. Its practical applications have had no discernible effects on efficiency, trust, or poverty reduction. Its real purpose has not been economic improvement but the cultivation of a distinct Islamic identity. It has served global Islamism (known also as Islamic fundamentalism) by fueling the illusion that modern Muslim societies can live by economic rules based on Islam.\n\nA comprehensive statement of Kuran\u2019s analysis and interpretation of Islamic economics is Islam and Mammon: The Economic Predicaments of Islamism. Islamic financial firms deal in interest routinely, he argues there, through ruses that make interest appear as a return to risk. Their operations do not differ, except symbolically, from those of conventional financial firms with which they compete. He also observes that modern zakat systems shuffle resources within the middle class or redistribute from poor to rich. Finally, he points to the lack of evidence that Islamic economics has improved trust or trustworthiness.\n\nFollowing Fazlur Rahman, Kuran argues that Islamic economics misunderstands the original functions of Quran-based Islamic institutions.\n\nKuran has written on the Islamic controversy over the permissibility of interest; the origins, historical functions, and modern variants of zakat; and Islamic credit cards.\n\nIslam and political performance of the Middle East \nWith a focus on the Middle East\u2019s institutional history, Kuran has explored why its modern states tend to be governed autocratically and why the region fares poorly in global indices of freedom. He proposes that three Islamic institutions played critical roles. Though designed to bind the state, Islam\u2019s original tax system was sidelined within a couple of generations. This Islamic waqf (as opposed to the modern waqf, which is a corporation) kept civic life anemic by restricting political participation and hindering collective action from below. And private commercial enterprises remained small and ephemeral, hindering the formation of stable coalitions capable of bargaining with the state.\n\nOttoman and Turkish documents \nIn his childhood and early adulthood, Timur Kuran collected postal stamps. As his academic career began and research foci changed, his collecting interests turned to poorly studied areas: (1) Ottoman and Turkish postal history and postal stationery; (2) Ottoman and Turkish revenue stamps; and, increasingly, (3) Ottoman and Turkish documents, with an emphasis on evidence relating to the modernization of economic and civic life.\n\nIn the third category, his major collections are on the following topics: official revenue stamps and their usages; Ottoman occupations; foreign occupations of Ottoman territories; private and semi-official social assistance; printing, the press, and publishing; banking and insurance; political organizations; education; and lotteries. These collections are furnishing data to Kuran\u2019s ongoing academic research on Ottoman and Turkish modernization from the late 1700s.\n\nHe has co-authored, with Mehmet Akan, volume 1 of an intended bilingual trilogy on the microhistory of the Turkish postal system.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Timur Kuran's website at Duke\n\n1954 births\nLiving people\nAmerican academics of Turkish descent\n20th-century American economists\nAmerican political scientists\nAmerican Islamic studies scholars\nDuke University faculty\nScholars of Islamic jurisprudence\nUniversity of Southern California faculty\n21st-century American economists\nEconomists from New York (state)\nPeople from New York City\nPrinceton University alumni\nStanford University alumni\nRobert College alumni\nPolitical economists\nTurkish philatelists\nHistorians of the Middle East\nAmerican historians of Islam\nHistorians of Turkey\nScholars of Ottoman history","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135402}

{"text":"Frank Butcher is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Mike Reid. Frank makes his first appearance on-screen as a guest character in 1987, but due to a positive viewer reception, he is reintroduced in 1988 as a regular. Reid took a long hiatus from EastEnders in 1994 and Frank remained off-screen for over a year and a half. Frank made his return as a recurring character from December 1995 to January 1998. Frank eventually becomes a regular once again from May 1998 to November 2000, when Reid quit the show. Frank makes three brief reappearances after that, the final one in December 2005. Following Reid's death in July 2007, Frank died off-screen and the character was celebrated with a special week of episodes in April 2008.\n\nFrank is a wheeler-dealer who likes to think of himself as a \"big player\" in the business world, but in reality, he is little more than a wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.\n\nStorylines\n\nBackstory\nFrank started out as a used-car salesman. He met Pat Harris (Pam St Clement) at Butlins in Clacton in 1958 and, despite being on holiday with his girlfriend June Simmonds, he was attracted to Pat. They had a passionate affair but June became pregnant, so he married her and broke Pat's heart. Frank and Pat met up from time to time and on each occasion the affair was rekindled, but Frank would not leave June; Pat eventually married and had two children of her own. Frank and June had four children: Clare (Lucy Foxell\/Caroline O'Neill) in 1959, Ricky (Sid Owen) in 1973, Diane (Sophie Lawrence) in 1974, and Janine (Rebecca Michael, Alexia Demetriou, Charlie Brooks) in 1983. June died of cancer in 1987 (although upon Frank's introduction, he says she died of a heart attack), leaving Frank widowed and their children motherless.\n\n1987\u20132000\n\nIn September 1987, Frank contacts Pat and they meet in Greenwich. Frank wants to reignite their romance and asks her to be the mother of his children but she refuses. Frank propositions Pat again in January 1988. Pat is still resistant but when Frank reappears in March, he finally convinces her to reunite. They take over the tenancy of The Queen Victoria public house soon afterwards, and the following year Frank also opens a car lot on the square. Frank and Pat marry in June 1989 in true cockney style, with Pat becoming stepmother to Ricky, Diane, and 5-year-old Janine (Rebecca Michael), who hates her.\n\nTroubled by family upsets, Frank is devastated in 1990 when his mother Mo (Edna Dor\u00e9) develops dementia. Her deterioration is rapid. In a lucid moment, she writes Frank a letter asking him not to let her end up like her grandmother, who had gone senile, saying she would rather die than suffer the same fate. Frank is torn, but attempts to adhere to his mother's wish by almost smothering her with a pillow while she sleeps. However, he cannot go through with it and instead sends Mo to live with his sister Joan Garwood (Mary Miller) in Colchester. In 1992, Frank was involved and helped Pete Beale (Peter Dean), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Big Ron (Ron Tarr) to intimidate rapist James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) into leaving the area. Later that year, Frank receives a huge tax demand, swiftly followed by a large VAT bill. This forces him to sell his B&B and the adjoining house and move his family into a small flat.\n\nPat establishes her own cab firm, PatCabs, which starts making them some money. However, on Christmas Eve that year, Pat runs over and kills a teenage girl and is later sentenced to six months in prison. Frank struggles alone and the Butchers end 1993 in financial ruin. In desperation, Frank coerces Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to set fire to his car lot in March 1994, so he can claim on the insurance. The car lot catches fire, as agreed, but beunknownst to Phil and Frank, a homeless man is sleeping in one of the cars and burns to death. Frank is arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but is later released due to lack of evidence. However, doubts remain as to whether he conspired to defraud his insurance company and an investigation takes place. Frank tries covering his tracks by claiming his accounts have burnt but Pat gives the business's books to the investigating agent. The pressure becomes too much for Frank, who is suffering severe guilt over the death of the homeless man. He becomes so depressed and despondent, no one can get through to him. Unable to cope, Frank leaves Walford and his family without warning in April 1994, and does not contact them to say where he is.\n\nWith no news of Frank, Pat is forced to get on with her life. She begins a romance with another car dealer, Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), in 1995 and by November, they are living together. When Pat receives a letter from a psychiatric hospital saying Frank has recovered from a breakdown and wants to reunite, she tears up the letter. On Christmas Day 1995, Frank arrives unannounced and is furious to discover Pat is living with Roy. Frank declares he wants his house, business, and children back and refuses to leave Walford. Pat's son David Wicks (Michael French) contacts his lawyers and is relieved to discover Frank has no claim on the car lot; however, Ricky gives his share of the business to Frank, who then threatens to sell Pat's house. Roy tries scaring Frank away via various underhand tricks. In a moment of remorse, Frank threatens to confess his involvement in the arson attack to the police. Pat attempts to make him reconsider and this leads to them having sex. Pat regrets her actions, but Frank takes great pleasure in telling Roy. Furious, Roy threatens to leave Pat; to stop him, she claims Frank is lying. She convinces Frank she does not love him; defeated, he leaves Walford in March 1996, and moves to Manchester.\n\nHe returns briefly in April 1997 for Ricky's wedding to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), and again in December to console Ricky following the loss of his child. On another visit in May 1998, he becomes attracted to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and they soon begin a relationship. Peggy asks Frank to move in with her at The Vic and they soon announce their engagement. Roy remains jealous of Frank, believing Pat has feelings for her ex-husband. When Pat turns to Frank following an argument with Roy and is seen leaving his flat, Roy and Peggy believe Frank and Pat are having an affair. Peggy calls off her engagement, and Roy speeds off in his car on a suicide bid, but Frank manages to convince him that his relationship with Pat is now platonic. He and Roy bond, leading Frank to admit he got a young woman called Gemma pregnant after first moving to Manchester, and had a young son, Danny, who was born in 1995.\n\nPeggy marries Frank in April 1999, despite opposition from her son Grant (Ross Kemp), who cannot forgive Frank for accidentally hitting and killing his wife Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) in a motor accident months earlier. Frank runs The Vic with Peggy, but in 2000 he starts to realise he is unhappy, as he still loves Pat. While the two couples holiday in Spain that summer, Pat and Frank have sex. Their affair continues for several months, and they eventually decide to elope to Manchester. They are due to leave on Guy Fawkes Night, but Pat has second thoughts. It is too late, however, as Peggy has already got Frank's letter of confession. Peggy shames Frank and Pat by reading the letter aloud in public, ending by slapping both Frank and Pat and then ejecting Frank. When Frank leaves Walford, Pat chases after him, shouting his name, but he does not hear, and drives away, leaving her sobbing in the rain.\n\n2002\n\nIn January 2002, Peggy receives news that Frank has died in a car crash in Spain, and travels there for his funeral, where she is stunned to see him in attendance. Several irate conversations reveal that Frank has faked his death to con expatriates in a property scam with his new girlfriend, Krystle (Rula Lenska). Krystle in turn cons Frank, running off with his money. Despite his past actions, Peggy takes pity on him, and gives Frank money, but turns down the opportunity of resuming a relationship with him.\n\n\"Perfectly Frank\"\n\nIn the special 2003 episode \"Perfectly Frank\", he returns to England, where he has set up a seedy nightclub and a car valeting service in Somerset. Problems arise when Frank receives a visit from council officer, Douglas Payne (Steve Elder), telling him that they have rejected his license to open a lap dancing club. Later, Frank's assistant, Kevin (Marc Jordan), is sent a car to valet by the local gangster, named Reg Priest (Gilbert Martin), and finds the body of Payne in the boot. Frank and his club staff try to find a way to avoid the police asking questions, and fall foul of Reg, so they throw the body into the water over the side of the pier. However, it later emerges that Reg only knocked Payne out, when he turns up alive, having survived the pier fall. Terrified of another attack, Payne agrees to approve Frank's license.\n\n2005\n\nIn December 2005, when Pat is due to give evidence at the trial of Janine (now played by Charlie Brooks), who has been wrongly accused of murdering Laura Beale (Hannah Waterman), Frank tries to get Pat to change her testimony. Pat and Frank have sex, but she is angry when she realises Frank is using their relationship to manipulate her. Nevertheless, after some contemplation, Pat changes her testimony. She and Frank say an emotional farewell, with Frank commenting that he will always love her. Frank tries to reunite with Janine outside the court but is saddened to discover she had already left without him, and was only using him to secure her release.\n\nOn 31 March 2008, Diane and Ricky reveal that Frank has died at Diane's home in France of throat cancer. His body is brought to Walford to be cremated. Following the funeral, Frank's ashes are scattered in Albert Square's flowerbeds. A heartbroken Pat orders a commemorative plaque dedicated to Frank, and has it mounted in Albert Square: it reads \"Frank Butcher 1940-2008, Husband, Father, Pilchard, Taken 68 years young\".\n\nCharacter creation and development\nThe character of Frank was introduced to the series in September 1987, when he met up with former girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement). Although it could not have been predicted at the time, Frank was perhaps the most important introduction to the series that year, as the popularity of his appearance led to him playing a far greater role the following year. Frank was played by Mike Reid, who was already an established comedian and well known to British audiences. The casting of a comedian in a dramatic role was highly controversial at the time, but over the years, the wisdom of that decision was proved correct, as Frank became one of the show's most popular and iconic characters. His successful casting set a precedent in British soap, and subsequently, many established comedians and comic actors have gone on to play substantial roles in several notable soap operas, including Barbara Windsor, Bradley Walsh, Shane Richie, Bobby Davro and Les Dennis, among others. \n\nFollowing Anita Dobson's  (Angie) and Leslie Grantham's (Den) decisions to quit the show in 1988, Frank was reintroduced as a full-time character and installed as the new Landlord of The Queen Vic, which he ran with his future wife, Pat, before opening a used car-lot on the Square. Although extremely different from their predecessors, Frank and Pat were also a live-wire couple, whose relationship proved popular with the audience. Their wedding in 1989 was seen as one of the year's highlights. Penned by new EastEnders writer Tony Jordan, Frank and Pat celebrated their big day in true East End style with a street party organised by Frank's mother, Mo (Edna Dor\u00e9). Although planned for a summer's day, the lot material filmed on Albert Square was recorded in the middle of gale-force winds. The episode was scripted to portray a strong sense of community spirit and a feel-good theme, as until that year, EastEnders had come under attack from critics who suggested the show had become too depressing. Some 11.9 million viewers tuned in to see Frank and Pat finally tie the knot.\n\nHowever, as is customary in EastEnders, their marriage did not remain happy for long, and after an array of family and monetary problems, Frank began to sink into deep depression. Playing a depressed character took its toll on Mike Reid, and he also began to suffer with depression, so, in 1994, he took a long hiatus from EastEnders. On-screen, his character attempted an insurance scam by having his car-lot torched and was unable to cope with the resulting guilt after the fire claimed the life of a homeless man. Frank disappeared from the show under a cloud of mystery in April 1994, and for a while he was presumed dead, as none of his family had heard anything from him. Pat eventually moved on, and moved in with another man, only for Frank to make a shocking return. Almost 17 million viewers tuned in to see Frank reunited with Pat on Christmas Day 1995. His stay was brief, lasting only a few months, but it drew a line under his relationship with Pat, and after failing to win her back, Frank was forced to move on too. Frank made several brief appearances in the show after this time, but in May 1998, he made a full-time return, this time as a love interest to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). However, Frank's affinity with Pat remained an underlying theme for both characters, and despite being separated, viewers were regularly reminded of their lustful connection. Pat's fourth husband Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) was deliberately made impotent in the series, so Pat would not be sexually unfaithful to Frank. In an interview, Pam St. Clement has suggested that Pat and Frank are the biggest \"love story\" in EastEnders, commenting; \"the trouble is, they're a classic example of a couple who can't live with each other and yet don't want to live without each other.\"\n\nUpon his return, Frank was once again pivotal to many explosive storylines including accidentally killing Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) with his car, his marriage to Peggy, and a battle to regain control of The Queen Vic from Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). However, in early 2000, Reid began to go through some poor health. After suffering with nervous exhaustion, which he attributed to EastEnders''' gruelling filming schedule, Reid was forced to take an unplanned break from the show. Penned scripts and plots had to be completely rewritten to account for his absence, including the departure of Sid Owen, who played Reid's on-screen son Ricky. The storyline was initially planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's absence, Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode, resulting in a slightly less plausible plotline. Upon Reid's return, further problems arose, allegedly regarding the producers' decision not to allow him to attend a charity function that was being held in his honour. Reid allegedly quit in protest, although the BBC have since denied this. Reid was persuaded by producer John Yorke to remain in the role for a further six months in order to facilitate one further explosive storyline. Frank resumed his relationship with old flame Pat whilst still married to Peggy, but was famously caught out and shamed by his fuming wife in front of a packed pub on Guy Fawkes Night 2000, although Pat had decided against running away with Frank at the last minute. After receiving a hefty slap, Frank left once again, leaving his wife in serious debt, just as he had done to Pat years earlier.\n\nFollowing this, Frank made several brief appearances in the show, and was even given his own spin-off special, entitled EastEnders: Perfectly Frank. The programme followed Frank as he set up a new business in Somerset and brought in an entirely new set of characters unrelated to those in Albert Square. The soap bubble was written by Tony Jordan, directed by Clive Arnold and aired in 2003. The project was relatively unsuccessful, and was only watched by 3.8 million viewers.  Despite rumours that the concept was being groomed as a potential spin-off series, this did not materialise.\n\nFrank made yet another comeback to EastEnders in late 2005, for another week's stint, but Reid made it clear on The Paul O'Grady Show that this was to be the final time viewers would see Frank, as the storyline gave ultimate closure to his relationship with Pat. Reid allegedly turned down subsequent offers of a return.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Mike Reid in July 2007, executive producer Diederick Santer announced in November 2007 that the character would die off-screen; this occurred at the end of March 2008, when it was revealed that Frank had succumbed to throat cancer. On-screen, Frank was brought back to Walford to be cremated and was given a send-off in a special week of episodes, dubbed Frank Week, which saw his former wives Peggy and Pat reigniting their old feud. Throughout the episode of his funeral on 1 April, old clips of Frank's time in the serial were played as flashbacks, including Frank and Pat's wedding from 1989 and Frank naked in a revolving bow-tie from 2000.\n\nReception\n\nFrank remains one of EastEnders best-loved characters and many associate him with a 'golden era of the square'. Following Mike Reid's death in 2007, BBC series controller, John Yorke, commented \"Frank Butcher was one of a select group of truly great EastEnders' characters and the skill with which Mike Reid played him made him one of the most popular and well-loved of all.\"\n\nIn a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13 percent chose Frank Butcher as the soap character they were most happy to see return. He came third in the poll, behind EastEnders' Den Watts (32 percent) and Sharon Watts (21 percent). Twelve percent of viewers disagreed, as Frank also polled fourth place when viewers were asked \"which soap character was it a bad idea to bring back?\", coming behind Coronation Street's Bet Lynch (28 percent), EastEnders Den Watts (28 percent), and Coronation Street's Liz McDonald (14 percent).\n\nA comic scene that saw the character seduce Pat by arriving on her doorstep in nothing but a revolving bow-tie has been voted the fifth Top Soap Moment in a five poll in 2004, and he was also voted the seventh most popular King of Soaps in a Channel 4 poll in 2002. In addition, Frank is fondly remembered for his unique style of cockney slang. A term \"dry slap\" that Reid introduced into the character's dialogue has transitioned, and is now utilised in British culture as a noun to describe a punch.\n\n In popular culture \nIn the 1990s, Mike Reid starred in an advert for the then new soft drink Oasis, whose slogan at the time was \"Open, pour, be yourself once more\". In the advert, Reid was dressed as Frank and initially roamed around with an uncharacteristically sunny disposition, until he drank the beverage and trod in a cow pat. After this, he took on a miserable expression, and exclaimed \"Pat... Oh Pat, what have you done to me Pat?\" in a blatant reference to his EastEnders'' alter ego.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nEastEnders characters\nFictional bartenders\nFictional businesspeople\nTelevision characters introduced in 1987\nFictional salespeople\nFictional characters with cancer\nMale characters in television\nFictional attempted suicides\nButcher family (EastEnders)\nFictional characters incorrectly presumed dead","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135404}
{"text":"Nor Crystal Tears is a science fiction novel by American  writer Alan Dean Foster, first published  on 12 August  1982. Foster's ninth book set in the Humanx Commonwealth, it is a first-contact story about the meeting of the insectoid Thranx and Man.  This sets in motion the creation of the Humanx Commonwealth; the political body that is the union of human and thranx society which forms the foundation for many of Foster's science-fiction novels.\n\nNor Crystal Tears is written from the perspective of the Thranx and the cultural lens through which they encounter the monstrous, fleshy alien mammals known as humans.  A primary theme is the paranoia and fear the two vastly different races naturally have for each other upon first contact, but also how individuals are able to overcome these innate fears and prejudices and set in motion the foundation for what would become Foster's Humanx Commonwealth.\n\nFoster would further expand on this theme with another alien race, the furry Quozl, in their eponymous novel.\n\nPlot summary\nThe story follows a Thranx, Ryozenzuzex (i.e. Ryo, of Family Zen, clan Zu, Hive Zex) who came from an odd-numbered hatching (thranx offspring almost always come in multiples of two) immediately making him somewhat different from his brethren. Setting himself aside as different Ryo decides that he has to know what is the secret of the new space-faring race that supposedly wear \"their skeletons inside\". To accomplish this un-thranxlike task, Ryo travels from his home planet, Willow-Wane, to the ice caps of the Thranx home world, Hivehom with the aid of the wealthy Wuuzelansem, a poet in search of inspiration.  Once on Hivehom he is confronted with the \"monsters\" and comes to the conclusion that they must set them free, believing that an alliance between Thranx and these so-called \"humans\" is the only way to stop the aggressive advances of the AAnn Empire.\n\nThranx military and scientists, by studying the contained humans tendency to fight amongst each other came to the conclusion that the entire species could be insane and would destroy Thranx society if they were to attempt any further contact.  Ryo, after spending a good amount of time with the humans, decides to aid in their escape from Hivehom.  Once they escape, they return to a human research station where the reaction to Ryo is worse than anticipated.  When the scientists there decide to kill and dissect Ryo the crew he rescued from Hivehom returns the favor and helps him escape his death sentence.  It is at this point Ryo and the crew come to the conclusion that they must start a long-term program in order to properly integrate human and thranx society.\n\nWith the scientists he befriended on Hivehom, Ryo brings a group of human children and researchers to interact with a group of Thranx larvae on his home of Willow-Wane in an attempt to build lasting race relations.  The larvae and human children seem to get along well and the compatibility between the two races is confirmed.  When an AAnn raiding party attacks Ryo's hive, the militant humans take action which results in a formal first contact between both human and Thranx governments.\n\nBy his risky actions, Ryo plants the seeds of what would become the Humanx Commonwealth.\n\nCharacters\n Ryozenzuzex - The novel's central protagonist Ryo was hatched from an odd number of eggs on the Thranx colony world of Willow-Wane and from his larva stage was always a voracious learner.  He wanted to be able to learn aspects of all subjects, but this was discouraged and he ultimately chose the career path of agriculture, yet he still yearned for something more.  When he heard of the potential existence of a strange, fleshy sentient life he left Willow-Wane on a mad quest.  In his journey Ryo would form the foundation for the unity between Humans and Thranx that would become the Humanx Commonwealth.  His always supportive premate is Falmiensazex. \n Wuuzelansem - One of the most well-known poets in all of Thranx space, and a native of Willow-Wane, Wuu encounters Ryo when the young thranx attempts a failed mugging.  Listening to Ryo's explanation of his yearning to seek out this strange new sentient species, Wuu decides to take Ryo in on an adventure, because the poet sees every new experience as a source of inspiration (A quality that carries over to his future student, Desvendapur, who also plays a crucial role in the foundations of the Humanx Commonwealth).\n\nSee also\nThe following novels form Foster's Founding of the Commonwealth trilogy which further expand upon initial contact between the Thranx and humanity and the events that united the two species. \n Phylogenesis\n Dirge\n Diuturnity's Dawn\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Alan Dean Foster homepage\n\n1982 American novels\n1982 science fiction novels\nAmerican science fiction novels\nHumanx Commonwealth\nNovels by Alan Dean Foster\nDel Rey books\nBooks with cover art by Michael Whelan","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135405}
{"text":"Pascal Themanlys (27 September 1909 \u2013 25 June 2000) was a French (later Israeli) poet, Zionist, and Kabbalist. His books on Jewish mysticism have been published in French, English and Hebrew.\n\nPascal was born in Paris; his French parents Louis and Claire Themanlys were important disciples of Max Theon, and in charge of the \"Cosmic Movement\" in France. Pascal himself only met Theon once in 1920 (when he was eleven, Th\u00e9on was well into his seventies), although he claimed later he was initiated by his father Louis. This supplemented his own studies of traditional Lurianic Kabbalah. \n\nAt fifteen, he published his first collection of poems, work of poems, a booklet called the Emerald Monocle, in 1924. He met a number of important authors and artists such as Rabindranath Tagore and Paul Val\u00e9ry.

{"text":"Xi Aquilae (\u03be Aquilae, abbreviated Xi Aql, \u03be Aql), officially named Libertas , is a red-clump giant star located at a distance of  from the Sun in the equatorial constellation of Aquila. As of 2008, an extrasolar planet (designated Xi Aquilae b, later named Fortitudo) has been confirmed in orbit around the star.\n\nNomenclature \n\n\u03be Aquilae (Latinised to Xi Aquilae) is the star's Bayer designation. Following its discovery the planet was designated Xi Aquilae b.\n\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Libertas for this star and Fortitudo for its planet.\n\nThe winning names were those submitted by Libertyer, a student club at Hosei University of Tokyo, Japan. The names which were originally proposed were in English and were 'Liberty' and 'Fortitude', but to comply with the IAU's rules they were modified to be Latin versions of the same words, and so the final names became 'Libertas' and 'Fortitudo' respectively. 'Aquila' is Latin for 'eagle', a popular symbol of liberty and embodiment of fortitude\u2014emotional and mental strength in the face of adversity.\n\nIn 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nProperties\nThis star has an apparent visual magnitude of 4.722, which, according to the Bortle Dark-Sky scale, is bright enough to be viewed with the naked eye from dark suburban skies. The orbital motion of the Earth causes this star to undergo an annual parallax shift of 17.77\u00a0milliarcseconds. From this measurement, the distance to this star can be determined, yielding an estimate of approximately 184 light-years with a 2% margin of error. The magnitude of the star is diminished by 0.09 from the extinction caused by interstellar gas and dust.\n\nThe spectrum of this star is considered a standard example of the stellar classification G9.5\u00a0IIIb, where the G9.5 means that it belongs to the category of G-type stars while the luminosity class of IIIb indicates that, at an estimated age of nearly five billion years, is an evolved star that has reached the giant stage. It is in the red clump, meaning it is generating energy through the fusion of helium into carbon at its core.\n\nXi Aquilae has an estimated 116% of the Sun's mass, while its outer atmosphere has expanded to more than ten times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating 49 times the Sun's luminosity at an effective temperature of , giving it the golden-hued glow of a G-type star. The possibility of a binary stellar companion can be ruled out based upon observations with the CHARA array.\n\nPlanetary system \n\nIn 2008, the presence of a planetary companion was announced, based upon Doppler spectroscopy results from the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory. This object, designated as Xi Aquilae b, has at least 2.8 Jupiter masses and is orbiting at an estimated 0.68 astronomical unit from the star with a period of 136.75 days. Any planets that once orbited to the interior of this object may have been consumed as the star entered the red giant stage and expanded in radius.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n HR 7595\n Image Xi Aquilae\n wikisky.org\n\nG-type giants\nHorizontal-branch stars\nPlanetary systems with one confirmed planet\nAquila (constellation)\nLibertas\nAquilae, Xi\nDurchmusterung objects\nAquilae, 59\n188310\n097938\n7595","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135407}
{"text":"Aretas IV Philopatris (Nabataean Aramaic: \ud802\udc97\ud802\udc93\ud802\udc86\u200e \ud802\udc8a\ud802\udc9b\ud802\udc9e\ud802\udc9e \ud802\udc9b\ud802\udc8a\ud802\udc92 \u1e24\u0101r\u012b\u1e6fat R\u0101\u1e25em-\u02bfammeh, \"Aretas, friend of his people\") was the King of the Nabataeans from roughly 9 BC to AD 40.\n\nHis daughter Phasaelis was married to, and divorced from, Herod Antipas. Herod then married his stepbrother's wife, Herodias. It was opposition to this marriage that led to the beheading of John the Baptist. After he received news of the divorce, Aretas invaded the territory of Herod Antipas and defeated his army.\n\nRise to power\n\nAretas came to power after the assassination of Obodas III, who was apparently poisoned. Josephus says that he was originally named Aeneas, but took \"Aretas\" as his throne name. An inscription from Petra suggests that he may have been a member of the royal family, as a descendant of Malichus I.\n\nThe capital of his kingdom was a prosperous trading city, Petra, some 170 miles south of Amman. Petra is famous for the many monuments carved into the rose-red sandstone. The power of the Nabateans extended over the caravan routes south and east of Judea, from the seventh century BC to the second century AD.\n\nHis full title, as given in the inscriptions, was \"Aretas, King of the Nabataeans, Friend of his People.\" Being the most powerful neighbour of Judea, he frequently took part in the state affairs of that country and was influential in shaping the destiny of its rulers. While not on particularly good terms with Rome, and though it was only after great hesitation that Augustus recognized him as king, he nevertheless took part in the expedition of Varus against the Jews in the year 4 BC, and placed a considerable army at the disposal of the Roman general.\n\nAretas had two wives. The first was Huldu to whom he was already married when he became king. Her profile was featured on Nabataean coins until 16 AD. After a gap of a few years the face of his second wife, Shaqilath, began appearing on the coins.\n\nDefeat of Herod Antipas\n \nAretas' daughter, Phasaelis of Nabataea, married Herod Antipas, otherwise known as Herod the Tetrarch. Phasaelis fled to her father when she discovered her husband intended to divorce her in order to take a new wife, Herodias, mother of Salome. Herodias was already married to his brother, Herod II, who died around AD 33\/34. Antipas married Herodias. According to Christian accounts, it was opposition to this marriage that led to the beheading of John the Baptist. However, the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus depicts John's execution instead as being a preemptive effort to prevent a rebellion.\n\nAretas invaded Herod Antipas' domain and defeated his army, partly because soldiers from the region of Philip the Tetrarch (a third brother) gave assistance to King Aretas. Josephus does not identify these auxiliary troops (he calls them 'fugitives'), but Moses of Chorene identifies them as being the army of King Abgarus of Edessa.   Antipas was able to escape only with the help of Roman forces.\n\nHerod Antipas then appealed to Emperor Tiberius, who dispatched the governor of Syria, Lucius Vitellius the Elder, to attack Aretas. Vitellius gathered his legions and moved southward, stopping in Jerusalem for the passover of AD 37, when news of the emperor's death arrived. The invasion of Nabataea was never completed.\n\nThe Christian Apostle Paul mentions that he had to sneak out of Damascus in a basket through a window in the wall to escape the ethnarch of King Aretas (2 Corinthians 11:32, 33, cf Acts 9:23, 24). Proposals that control of Damascus was gained by King Aretas between the death of Herod Philip in 33\/34 AD and his death in 40 AD are contradicted by substantial evidence against Aretas controlling the city before 37 AD and many reasons why it could not have been a gift from Caligula between 37 and 40 AD. Most uncertainty stems from whether troops belonging to Aretas actually controlled the city, or if Paul was referring to \"the official in control of a Nabataean community in Damascus, and not the city as a whole.\" Several have proposed that Aretas briefly annexed Damascus after 37 AD.\n\nAretas IV died in AD 40 and was succeeded by his son Malichus II and daughter Shaqilath II.\n\nSee also\nList of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources\nList of rulers of Nabatea\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1st-century BC Nabataean monarchs\n1st-century Nabataean monarchs\n1st-century BC births\n40 deaths\nPeople in the Pauline epistles\nRoman client rulers\n1st-century BC monarchs in Asia\n1st-century BC Arabs","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135408}
{"text":"Peter Crimmins (8 July 1948 \u2013 28 September 1976) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Hawthorn Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL). \"Crimmo\" was known as a lightly built but courageous and skilful rover whose early passing from cancer is one of Australian football's saddest stories. Hawthorn subsequently named the club Best and Fairest award in his honour.\n\nVFL career\nCrimmins was born in 1948, one of five sons to father Bryan, who had also played in the VFL, appearing in one game for . He was educated at Assumption College and quickly gained attention of Victorian football scouts with his skilful and fearless style of play, on one occasion kicking ten goals roving for the school's senior team. Peter chose Hawthorn as his father was a policeman stationed at Hawthorn at the time.\n\nShowing good form in the practice matches, Crimmins was one of five Hawthorn debutantes chosen for the opening game of the 1966 VFL season. In a game best remembered for 's Peter McKenna kicking twelve goals, Crimmins managed to kick two himself. The newspaper The Age said Crimmins looked a little light but showed great courage.\n Right from the start Crimmins and courage went hand in hand. \n\nIn the 1971 VFL Grand Final, he was among the best players afield as the Hawks came from behind to defeat St Kilda by 7 points.\n\nAt the end of 1973, David Parkin stood down as captain; Peter Crimmins was elected to the position in his place.\n\nCancer diagnosis\nAt the completion of the 1974 VFL season, Crimmins was diagnosed with testicular cancer. After surgery and two bouts of chemotherapy in 1975, he attempted to make a return, declaring that he was fit to play in the 1975 VFL Grand Final after playing 5 reserve games, including one final. Both the selection committee and Hawthorn's supporters were divided over whether he should play. Ultimately, the match committee decided against playing him in the game, with coach John Kennedy admitting they were fearful a knock could affect him. As he explained later: \"It was very hard, it was a unique situation ... Peter wanted to play. The committee was divided. He didn't play. We'll never know what might have happened if he had played.\" The Hawks lost the Grand Final to North Melbourne.\n\nCrimmo's Cup\nThroughout the next year Crimmins health deteriorated again, but by the end of the season Hawthorn was again facing North Melbourne for the 1976 VFL Grand Final. By this stage Crimmins was confined to his sickbed, unable to even attend the game, and with live television broadcasts of the Grand Final not introduced until 1977, he was reduced to merely listening to it on the radio.<ref>[http:\/\/www.theage.com.au\/articles\/2003\/08\/16\/1060936101063.html Melbourne Age Clubs use new game plan in dealing with trauma 17 August 2003]<\/ref> Just before the Hawthorn players took the field Kennedy read out a telegram which Crimmins had sent to the club, saying \"Good luck to you and all the boys. It will be a long, hard, 100 minutes but I am sure you will be there at the end. Regards, Peter Crimmins.\" Kennedy implored his players to \"Do it for the little fella\", and later stated that he believed his team was never going to lose. Hawthorn won the game by thirty points to take the Premiership.\n\nThe night of the Grand Final six of Crimmins' closest teammates took the premiership cup to Crimmins' house in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne to let him share in the celebrations. A press photographer accompanied them and a famous photo was published in the newspapers showing a wasted, reclining, yet beaming Crimmins holding the premiership cup surrounded by his jubilant teammates. The premiership victory became known around Hawthorn and in the football community as 'Crimmo's Cup' in recognition of the inspiration Crimmins provided to his team.\n\nCrimmins died just three days after the game, aged 28. He was survived by his wife and two sons. The image of a stricken Crimmins holding the premiership cup and surrounded by teammates is captured in Jamie Cooper's painting The Game That Made Australia'', commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.\n\nThe Number 5\nCrimmins' number 5 was retired following his death, with the plan to bring the number back in the event one of his sons was able to play for the Hawks. Once it became clear this would not happen, a decision was made by the family to return the jumper to circulation, with the family choosing the player who best exemplified Crimmins to wear the number. In 1993, Andy Collins was awarded the jumper. In 1997, the jumper was awarded to Daniel Harford. In 2004, the jumper was awarded to Sam Mitchell, who would go on to wear the jumper in four premierships, one as captain, and to five Peter Crimmins Medals, the Hawthorn Best and Fairest that was renamed in his honour. Following Mitchell leaving the club in 2016, the jumper was awarded to Ryan Burton, and following his trade to  in 2018, James Worpel was awarded the jumper.\n\nCrimmins' jumper was hung in the boardroom at Glenferrie Oval until the club left in 2005.

{"text":"Slough Jets are an ice hockey team from Slough, Berkshire, England playing in the NIHL South Division 1. The team was founded in 1986 after the construction of the Slough Ice Arena in Montem Lane in Slough and joined the first division of the British League. With the help of Gary Stefan who had previously been with Streatham Redskins, the Slough Jets were formed.\n\nThe Slough Jets are one of the few clubs in the UK who from their foundation have continued to play to the present day without interruption or a change of name.\n\nHistory\n\nThe British Hockey League (1986-1996) \nIt did not take long for Slough Jets to make their mark, winning the London Cup in 1989 . They followed this up by winning the Southern Cup and the British League Division One the following season, but they lost the final of the promotion play-off and so did not move up to the Premier Division.\n\nThe Jets were runners-up in Division One for three of the next four seasons, before winning the Division and the promotion play-off in 1995, thus moving up to the Premier Division.\n\nThe British National League (1996-2002) \nAfter a brief settling-in period in the new league structure, the Jets won more silverware in 1998, capturing the Benson & Hedges Plate, and also finishing second in the BNL Southern Premier League the same year. The following season, 1998\u201399, was the most successful in the club's history to that point, as they won the British National League for the first time. They were also runners-up in the British National League Play-offs, losing to Fife Flyers on penalties.\n\nThe club were beaten finalists in the Benson & Hedges Plate in 2000, and this was also the year that one of their greatest players, Gary Stefan, was elected to the Great Britain Hall of Fame. The next few years were to be a fallow spell for the club, who were actually disbanded in 2002 due to financial problems, but were re-formed the same year.\n\nThe English Premier Ice Hockey League (2002-2014) \nIn 2002 Teal & White Ltd took over the management of the Slough Jets. In their first EPIHL season the Jets finished 3rd and qualified for the play-offs. In the following year they made the Final of the play-offs.\n\nThere was another change of ownership in 2005 as Slapshot Ltd took over the running of the club.\n\nJets took runner up in the league in 2005\u201306, 2007\u201308 and 2009\u201310 but never made it to league champions. They were successful in the post season play-offs, winning the titles in the 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 and 2011\u201312 seasons. They also claimed the Premier Cup in 2011.\n\nThe final EPIHL season ended with the Jets struggling financially and coach Craig Moran having to hold together a team after Head coach Slava Koulikov left part way through the season  along with other players. The Jets finished bottom of the 10 team league and failed to make the play-offs.\n\nEnd of the Professional Era \nIn 2014 the Slough Jets ceased professional competition following a decision by Slapshot Ltd to exit the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL) which was the 2nd tier of British Ice hockey at the time. The Slough Jets name continued with its existing amateur senior team in the National Ice Hockey League South 2 division and the Junior club. It was alleged that some supporters saw the move by the owners to end the professional era to effectively be the end of the club they supported. A move was made by Gary Stefan and Jets media man Mark Denholm  to create a new EPIHL team at the rink but attempts to secure ice time were not successful.\n\nA Slough Jets legends match was set up and played on July 14, 2014, to honour the club's professional history and raise money for charity.\n\nThe National Ice Hockey League (2014-Present) \nSlough Jets currently play in the National Ice Hockey League (NIHL) South 1 Britton Division, which is the third tier of UK hockey. After winning NIHL2 league and National honours in the 2018\/19 season, Slough Jets senior team moved to a 10 team NIHL1 division for 2019\/20 season in a revised English Ice hockey league structure which introduced a new second-tier league called the NIHL National hockey league.\n\nThe Slough Jets ENL side had already been formed in 2010 to replace the disbanded Slough Harrier Hawks side and provide a bridge for young players to move from junior hockey to senior hockey. Craig Moran initially took on the Head coach role before resuming his Assistant Manager role for the EPIHL side. When professional hockey ceased in Slough, the Slough Jets NIHL side became the top level of Senior men's hockey at the venue. The coach for the amateur side for the 2014\/15 season was Tony Milton.\n\nThe 2014\/15 season was a success as they stormed to the title losing just one match in regular season play from their 6 team league. Franchise owner and player Zoran Kosic leading the points scoring with 48 points and notable performances from Alan Green and exciting Slough U18 pair Ben and Josh Ealey-Newman. Jets lost in the final of the playoffs however 4\u20130 to the Bristol Pitbulls.\n\nAhead of the 2015\/16 season, departures affected the side with Zoran Kosic leaving and Alan Green and the Ealey-Newman brothers headed to Oxford. Nathan Darmanin was the top points scorer with 18 points as Jets only won 4 of 19 matches, finished 5 in their 6 team league and didn't make the play-offs.\n\nWith the closure of the rink for refurbishment, the team training in Guildford and Bracknell ice rinks and some fixture cancellations, the team struggled throughout the 2016\/17 season. Player injuries and fixture congestion  due to lack of ice whilst a temporary rink was constructed meant they could only finish bottom of the league with 4 victories to their name.  Top points scorer again was Nathan Darmanin with 25 points.\n\nAhead of the 2017\/18 season, it was announced that the former Bracknell Bees and Guildford Flames forward Lukas Smital was joining Slough Jets as player-coach to replace the departing Tony Milton. Smital took on a side who had struggled the previous season and finished bottom of their league of 6 teams. He was joined by former Bee and Slough player Joe Ciccarello as his assistant. Backstopped by impressive veteran Netminder Chris Douglas and with a mix of youth and experienced players, Slough finished a creditable 7th out of 13 teams in an expanded league structure  achieving unexpected results against strong Chelmsford, Peterborough and Bracknell sides as Jets turned their temporary rink into a very difficult place to go and get a result.\n\nLukas Smital himself was top points scorer for the Jets with 67. Chris Douglas and Lukas Smital made the NIHL2 South first All-Star team. Luke Reynolds who joined the club part way through the season from Milton Keynes Thunder made the NIHL2 South second All-Star team \n\nFollowing their return to the 'Hangar' in the 18\/18 season, the team showed good form and produced a series of victories to lead the league. Wins against the Solent Devils home and away being the decisive results. Jets were tied on points with Solent Devils after victory against Peterborough Phantoms 2 in the final match of the season but were awarded the league title due to the head-to-head results.\n\nAfter achieving the NIHL2 South title, the Slough Jets went to Coventry Skydome to play the NIHL2 North champions Widnes Wild for the NIHL2 National title . Man of the Match Sean Norris did the damage as Slough Jets came out victors 7-1 \n\nThe play-offs were less successful as the Slough Jets went out with a heavy 9\u20133 defeat in the semi-finals to eventual champions Chelmsford Chieftains in a match which was missing influential player-coach Lukas Smital.\n\nTop points scorer for the Jets during the season was Lukas Smital with 84 points. Lukas Smital again made the NIHL2 South first All-Star team. Sean Norris and Sam Talbot made the NIHL2 South second All-Star team \n\nJets re-signed Lukas Smital and the core of the NIHL2 South title winning side including Matt Smital in net, Lindgren, Reynolds, Rose, Talbot and Norris for the 2019\/20 season. In defence the experienced Matt Jordan came in from Bracknell. Lukas Smital announced his retirement from playing at the age of 44. The club also moved to the NIHL 1 South Britton division.\n\nThe Jets made a strong start to their life in NIHL1 by leading the division at the end of the first month with Sean Norris winning Player of the Month. They were unable to carry on this form though and a severe concussion injury to key forward Sean Norris against Oxford City Stars on October 13  put him out of the side for several weeks and a further injury against Milton Keynes Thunder upon his brief return saw him sidelined again before he made a decision to leave the club. Norris left the club to join the NIHL National Basingstoke Bison full time and was followed there in mid-January by Sam Talbot further weakening the Jets side.  Despite the loss of two key forward players and injuries to others, the emergence of junior players kept the club competitive and a top 4 spot still looked a possibility. By March the Jets still had several games in hand on other sides in the top 4 as the COVID-19 pandemic struck.\n\nAfter the Elite Ice Hockey League announced it was cancelling the 2019\/20 season on March 13  the EIHA made a statement that fixtures for the weekend were expected to continue. Chelmsford Chieftains cancelled the away fixture on March 14 citing players self isolating as well as concerns for player and supporter safety. Slough Jets cancelled their away fixture on March 15 against Bracknell Hornets as it became clear of the risk and concern amongst the players, supporters and their families. The EIHA made a decision to cancel the season the day after on March 16. The EIHA decided to award Bracknell Hornets a 5\u20130 victory for Slough Jets refusing to travel which moved them above Slough in the table and all other remaining fixtures were marked completed with no points awarded. This resulted in Slough Jets finishing the season 6th in the table.\n\nDespite leaving the Jets mid season, Sam Talbot was voted onto the second NIHL1 South All-Star team.\n\nThe 2020\/21 regular season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic however as part of a return to play several clubs played in a couple of round robin  mini tournaments. First of all was the South Cup  with the following teams involved; Haringey Huskies from NIHL2, Milton Keynes Thunder, Solent Devils and Slough Jets. As fans were not allowed in arenas at the time, the matches were streamed over the internet for fans to watch.\n\nThe eventual winners were Solent Devils who tied with Slough Jets on points but won on wins in regulation \n\nThe next return to play tournament was the Ruggedstock cup  which was contested between Haringey Huskies, Milton Keynes Thunder and eventual champions, the Slough Jets.\n\nAn NIHL division 1 Cup final was held in Sheffield at the end of the season  with two teams from the South in Slough Jets and Milton Keynes Thunder matching up against Widnes Wild and Sheffield Scimitars. The Jets lost in the semi-finals to Widnes Wild to end their season.\n\nIn the 2021\/22 season, the Slough Jets fielded a youthful side including many U18 junior players and had an average age of just 20. Despite the lack of experience, the Jets started competitively and were particularly strong in the Cup games. A close 2\u20131 loss away against eventual league, cup and playoff winners Streatham IHC with seven seconds left  showed the promise in the side. Slough Jets were the first away side to beat Bristol Pitbulls in their new rink with a 1\u20130 victory coming courtesy of a goal by Lewis English and a 61 shot shutout for Brett Shepherd.\n\nA number of Jets players were also involved in matches in the NIHL National league. Adam Rosbottom left the Jets to play for the Bees full time in January  at which point he was one of the Slough Jets top point scorers. Further departures shortly after were Thomas Banner to Basingstoke Bison and then Solomon Smith towards the end of the season.\n\nDespite being in the top four spots most of the season, Jets failed to get the points to beat off rivals towards the end of the season eventually finishing 5th. Slough Jets failed to make the final of the cup with a narrow 5\u20134 loss to Invicta Dynamos in the semi-finals over two legs and also didn't make the play off final weekend with a more comprehensive loss 14\u20137 to Chelmsford Chieftains in the quarter-final over two legs.\n\nThe 'Hangar' \nThe Slough Jets' home rink is the Slough Ice Arena, which is also known as the \"Hangar\". A complete renovation of the rink begun in November 2016  with the reopening of the refurbished and remodelled facility in April 2018. Whilst renovations where carried out, the Jets played out of a temporary facility located in the leisure centre car park. In 2020 a NIHL National league team the Bees (formally Bracknell Bees) moved to the rink following the closure of the John Nike Leisuresport ice rink facility in Bracknell.

{"text":"Rod, Jane and Freddy were a singing trio who appeared in children's programming on the British TV channel ITV in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.  They starred both in the long-running series Rainbow and their own 15-minute show. The trio have also made guest appearances in other children's TV shows, including The Sooty Show.\n\nThe original trio consisted of Rod Burton, Jane Tucker and Matthew Corbett, when they were known as \"Rod, Matt and Jane\". Matthew left the trio in 1976 to continue hosting The Sooty Show after his father retired. Matthew was replaced by actor Roger Walker, whereupon the trio became known as \"Rod, Jane and Roger\". When Walker left in 1980 to continue his career in acting he was replaced by Freddy Marks, leading to the best-remembered incarnation of the trio.\n\nDuring their three decades working on children's television they managed to write over 2,500 songs on various themes using many different music styles. Most were comedic but others had deeper meanings. Overall they have written and produced 10 albums and 24 videos, and have conceived and performed jingles for commercial radio, theme and title music for TV, and songs for pantomimes.\n\nRod, Jane and Freddy\n\nDue to their popularity on Rainbow, Rod, Jane and Freddy were approached by ITV in 1980 to make their own show, Rod, Jane and Freddy, which aired its first episode on 15 January 1981.  Rod, Jane and Freddy appeared in both their own show and Rainbow until 1989, when they left their position as musicians on Rainbow to focus solely on their own series.\n\nTheir show often followed a certain format:\n\n Opening with a big song, giving an idea of the particular show's topic (music and song, pets, moving house, etc.)\n Rod, Jane and Freddy would usually have solo songs\n There was often a sketch, but these were generally rarer than songs\n They would close with a final song\n As the credits rolled, the first or last song would be sung again.\n\nEpisode list\nThe following is a list of episodes.

{"text":"Johann Georg Grasel (; 4 April 1790 \u2013 31 January 1818) was a Czech robber and murderer. His name is used in Czech as a common term for a rascal or villain (gr\u00e1zl) to this day.\n\nBiography\nGrasel was born in Nov\u00e9 Syrovice into the poor family of a knacker. Both his father and his mother helped themselves by stealing, occasionally ending up in prison. Young Johann was forced to steal to survive and at the age of 9 he entered prison for the first time (for 2 weeks). Grasel became leader of several groups of brutal robbers in south Moravia and northern Lower Austria. He managed to escape from prison several times. In 1815 he and his group of 66 were caught by the authorities. Grasel was accused of 205 crimes, including several murders and sentenced to death. Sixty thousand people watched when he and his two colleagues were hanged in Vienna; when Grasel saw the crowds, he uttered his last words: \"Jesus, so many people\".\n\nUnlike many others of his kind Grasel entered folk legends, both as a noble hero who took from the rich to give to the poor and as a brutal rascal. The second interpretation made it into Czech and the word gr\u00e1zl (meaning \"villain\") is now commonly used, even without knowledge of its origin.\n\nPopular culture\nIn the Czechoslovak TV series  (Famous bandit stories, 1985), Grasel is portrayed by Czech actor Ivan Vysko\u010dil.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nGrasel's biography \n\n1790 births\n1818 deaths\nPeople from T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d District\nCzech people convicted of murder\nCzech serial killers\nExecuted serial killers\nMale serial killers\nPeople executed by hanging\nRobbers","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135415}
{"text":"CleanFlicks was a company founded in Utah in 2000 that rented and sold commercially-released DVDs and VHS tapes from which they had edited content which the company considered inappropriate for children or that viewers might otherwise find offensive. CleanFlicks removed sexual content, profanity, some references to deity, and some violence from movies, either by muting audio or clipping entire portions of the track.\n\nA group of major film productions studios sued CleanFlicks in 2002, arguing that their service constituted copyright infringement. A 2006 court ruling closed the company. On March 13, 2007, CleanFlicks reopened its website with \"Movies You Can Trust.\" While legally enjoined from offering edited movies, an email sent by the company on that date indicated that they had reviewed \"tens of thousands\" of movies and compiled over 1000 that meet their \"family-friendly criteria\" for sale and rent. In January 2013, the CleanFlicks.com website was no longer online.\n\nDirectors Guild lawsuit\nAn announcement (August 20, 2002) of intention on the Directors Guild of America website (on behalf of the guild and 12 directors) to sue seven entities that engage in the video-editing practice, caused CleanFlicks to preemptively file a lawsuit in Denver Federal Court in August 2002. Robert Huntsman, an attorney and inventor affiliated with Cleanflicks who had a DVD-editing patent pending, was named as the lead plaintiff, so the original short caption for the case was Huntsman v. Soderbergh. Robert Huntsman had been advising Corey Smitheram, former operator of four Idaho and Colorado Cleanflicks franchises, In their suit, Cleanflicks sought a judgment stating that edited content was legal under federal copyright law. In addition to director Steven Soderbergh, named defendants included Hollywood figures Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford, Sydney Pollack, Robert Altman, John Landis, and Martin Scorsese. Although the chain had been operating for two years, the issue was brought to the spotlight when MovieMask made a series of demonstrations around Hollywood in March of that year. The directors' counter-suit soon followed, but the legal battle stretched on for years.\n\nCleanFlicks and Huntsman preemptively filed suit against the DGA on August 29, naming 16 renowned directors as defendants  in U.S. District Court for the district of Colorado, seeking the Court's determination as to whether their editing practices are protected under federal copyright law. Also, the preemptive filing ensured the impending legal battle would play out in Colorado courts rather than in California.\n\nAs the case made national headlines, its short byline read \"Huntsman v. Soderbergh\". The docket header read:\n\nROBERT HUNTSMAN and CLEAN FLICKS OF COLORADO, L.L.C.,\nPlaintiffs,\nv.\nSTEVEN SODERBERGH, ROBERT ALTMAN, MICHAEL APTED, TAYLOR HACKFORD, CURTIS HANSON, NORMAN JEWISON, JOHN LANDIS, MICHAEL MANN, PHILLIP NOYCE, BRAD SILBERLING, BETTY THOMAS, IRWIN WINKLER, MARTIN SCORSESE, STEVEN SPIELBERG, ROBERT REDFORD and SYDNEY POLLACK\n\nOn July 6, 2006, a federal judge in Denver ruled that CleanFlicks' editing violated U.S. copyright laws.  The judge ordered the company to \"stop producing, manufacturing, creating, and renting\" edited movies, and to hand all inventory to movie studios within five days of the ruling. The court gave the company more time than the ruling's initial five-day deadline for turning over the stock of edited movies, since CleanFlicks needed more time to receive movies which were still out on rental.\n\nCleanFlicks had planned to appeal the ruling, but informed its customers by email on July 28, 2006:\n\nIt is with great regret that we write to inform you that CleanFlicks is going out of business soon. As you may have heard or read, after three long years of legal struggles, a judge in Colorado has ruled that we cannot sell or rent edited DVDs anymore. While we thought very strongly about appealing the decision, the potential costs and risks to the company, its customers and shareholders was just too great. Accordingly, we have agreed to close our doors after a brief winding-up period.\n\n...We want to offer our sincerest apologies for not being able to provide you with edited DVDs...We appreciate your support of our efforts to provide high-quality, family-friendly movies, and we will try to make this difficult process of closing our operations as painless as we can for all our loyal customers.\"The decision not to appeal the ruling became primarily a financial one. Having won the initial court battle, the directors and studios were in a position to collect significant damages for copyright infringement from the editing companies. Although the companies would almost certainly receive a stay of judgment pending appeals, the risk was much higher now. Since the inventory of edited movies had no value to the studios, a deal was offered whereby the companies would be allowed to sell off all of their inventory and keep the profits if they agreed not to appeal the ruling and the studios would not pursue damage claims. Thus, the companies, and their investors, would collect further revenue and be protected from damages and the studios would have a significant court ruling stand and the legal precedent would be set.  After discussions with their legal teams and investors, the decision was made to accept the offer. The companies were then given additional time to clear out their inventory but no more films could be edited during that time. All unsold inventory was then sent to the studios as defined by the ruling.\n\nCleanFlicks discontinued offering edited movies on August 31, 2006.\n\nRobert Huntsman\nRobert Huntsman (born March 9, 1955, Idaho Falls, Idaho) is an American copyright attorney, engineer, and inventor. He first entered the national spotlight for his association with CleanFlicks during their legal battle with the Directors Guild of America. Huntsman continues practicing law as principal of a small firm located in Boise, Idaho. He operates a litigation practice that includes a Federal Court litigation practice, an Idaho State Court litigation practice, and a Public Interest litigation practice. Huntsman is also a registered patent attorney, licensed to prepare and prosecute patent applications before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A former Hewlett-Packard software engineer, his website claims Huntsman to be one of few patent attorneys with significant software development experience.\n\nHuntsman had registered the domain \"qq.com\" as early as 1995, which was sold to Asian internet giant Tencent whose primary product is the online messaging service known simply as \"QQ\".\n\nRelaunch\nIn March 2007, CleanFlicks announced by email to former customers that they were relaunching their rental services based on a new business model.  Earlier in 2007, CleanFlicks had explored by email to, and online polling of, former customers the possibility of relaunching based on an unedited movie-rental business model.  As a result, rather than renting content-edited DVDs, CleanFlicks now offers DVD releases of unedited modern and classic movies.\n\nCleanFlicks' inventory now contains \"ONLY Movies You Can Trust\".  Movies rented from the company \"will contain no nudity, no graphic violence, and no sexual content.\"\n\nFormer customers' accounts have been retained in the CleanFlicks database, allowing those customers as well as the general public to resume their patronage of CleanFlicks using a \"movies-out-at-a-time\" tiered structure as before.\n\nClearPlay\n\nAlternatively, a system called ClearPlay uses a customized DVD player with software running concurrently with the DVD playback to perform edits (actually skips) in real-time during the playback, instead of playing back pre-edited movies.\n\nSee also\n Clean Films\n ClearPlay\n Re-edited film\n CleanflixReferences\n\nExternal links\nCountersuit filed against Robert Huntsman and CleanFlicks of Colorado - a lawsuit was also filed by Mel Gibson because CleanFlicks removed the three most violent scenes of his film The Passion of the Christ''.\n Law Firm's Official site\n\nCompanies based in Utah\n2000 establishments in Utah\nMass media companies established in 2000\nFilm censorship in the United States","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135416}
{"text":"Libertas \"Libs\" Schulze-Boysen, born Libertas Viktoria Haas-Heye (20 November 1913, Paris \u2013 22 December 1942, Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison) was a German aristocrat and resistance fighter against the Nazis. From the early 1930s to 1940, Schulze-Boysen attempted to build a literary career, first as a press officer and later as a writer and journalist. Initially sympathetic to the Nazis, she changed her mind after meeting and marrying Luftwaffe officer Harro Schulze-Boysen.\n\nAs an aristocrat, Schulze-Boysen had contact with many different people in different strata of German society. Starting in 1935, she utilized her position to recruit left-leaning Germans into discussion groups-nee-parties which she hosted at her and Harro's apartment. Through these discussions, resistance to the Nazi regime grew, and by 1936, she and Harro began to actively resist the Nazis.  \n\nDuring the early 1940s, whilst working as a censor for the German Documentary Film Institute, Schulze-Boysen began to document atrocities committed by the Nazis from photographs of war crimes forwarded by soldiers of the Sonderbehandlungen task force to the Film Institute. By 1940, the couple came into contact with other Berlin-based anti-fascist resistance groups and collaborated with them. The most important of these was run by Arvid Harnack. From June 1941, their underground resistance group became an espionage operation that supplied military and economic intelligence to the Soviet Union. That organisation became known as the Red Orchestra (\"Rote Kapelle\") by the Abwehr. She was arrested in September 1942, a month after her husband Harro, and both were executed on the same day in Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison.\n\nLife\n\nLibertas Schulze-Boysen was the youngest of three children. Her father was the Heidelberg-born Otto Ludwig Haas-Heye (1879-1959), couturier to the aristocracy, and her mother was noted pianist Viktoria Ada Astrid Agnes Gr\u00e4fin zu Eulenburg (1886-1967). Libertas' parents married in  on 13 May 1909 and lived for a time in London and Paris. They were Protestants who believed in providing a religious foundation for their children. Despite her upbringing, Libertas never became overtly religious, although many of her early poems and later letters show Christian roots. Her sister was Countess Ottora Maria Douglas-Reimer (1910 -b2001), who married Count Carl Ludvig Douglas (1908 - 1961), a Swedish diplomat. The couple had four children: Count Gustav Archibald Sigvart Douglas (1938-2023), a stockbroker, Princess Elisabeth Christina Douglas (b. 1940), Rosita Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (b. 1943), an artist, and their youngest son, Carl Philipp Morton, a civil engineer. Libertas' older brother,  (1912 - 2008), was a journalist and diplomat.\n\nHer mother was known as \"Thora\"\u2014spelled \"Tora\"\u2014and came from an old Prussian noble family. She was the youngest of the eight children of the Prussian diplomat and composer Prince Philipp zu Eulenburg and Swedish former Countess Augusta, Princess of Eulenburg. Philipp zu Eulenburg was a close friend of Kaiser Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig and his Swedish wife, Augusta Gr\u00e4fin Sandels (1853 - 1941). Eulenburg and William I were allegedly lovers. This allegation was published as a series of articles by influential journalist Maximilian Harden in the Berlin newspapers between 1907 and 1909. It ran so long it became known as the Eulenburg affair.\n\nIn 1921, when Libertas was eight years old, her parents divorced (unusual at the time) and her grandfather died. Libertas spent part of her childhood at Eulenburg's country estate, Liebenberg Castle (near Berlin). She was taught initially by a governess.  \n\nIn 1922, she began attending a school in Berlin while living with her father, who headed the fashion department of the Kunstgewerbemuseum. Later, a co-worker of her father (artist Valerie Wolffenstein) supervised her during a summer in Switzerland in 1924, where Libertas learned to draw. Between 1926 and 1932, Schulze-Boysen was sent to be educated at boarding schools in Paris, London and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1932, Schulze-Boysen completed her Abitur at a girls' finishing school in Zurich, followed by a 9-month stay in Ireland and the United Kingdom. After returning in January 1933, Schulze-Boysen attended a Nazi torchlight procession that marched past the Reich Chancellery. Though not totally understanding the new and powerful German Youth Movement, she was impressed enough with them to join the Nazi Party with member number 1 551 344, in March 1933,  and at the same time the League of German Girls (German: Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del).\n\nAs a press officer\nIn May of the same year, Schulze-Boysen moved to Berlin after being hired by the motion picture company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) as a press officer informing the media about new cinematic releases. During the spring of 1933 the film studio had sacked all its Jewish employees, leaving it short-staffed and making openings for non-Jewish workers. Initially, Libertas worked on press copy for the American films Sons of the Desert and Dancing Lady, both of which were immediate successes. In May 1933, when the studio started to feel the effects of Nazi censorship, it was forced to drop Herman Mankiewicz's screenplay The Mad Dog of Europe, a film meant to illuminate the worsening treatment of Jews in Germany at that time. Mankiewicz would later go on to write the screenplay for Citizen Kane.\n\nIn April 1934, Libertas met Harro Schulze-Boysen while they were both sailing on the Wannsee. Harro Schulze-Boysen was a publisher of left-liberal magazine Der Gegner (English: \"The Opponent\") between 1932 and 1933. It was closed down when he was arrested by the Sturmabteilung in April 1933. He was badly beaten and lost half his ear, and was only released due to the influence of his mother. Besides the mutilation of his ear, the attack left Harro with damaged kidneys. His Jewish friend Henry Erlanger, who was arrested at the same time, did not survive the beating. \n\nHarro was in the habit of bringing his work friends from Der Gegner together with his other friends and colleagues for social evenings in his apartment, during which they discussed philosophical and political questions of the day. To protect themselves from further persecution, the couple surrounded themselves with a group of politically incorruptible friends who were left-leaning anti-fascists, among them artists, pacifists and Communists.\n\nIn October 1934 the couple moved together to an apartment in Hohenzollerndamm, in the Wilmersdorf district of Berlin. On the 15th of January 1935, Schulze-Boysen left to join the Reich Labour Service for female youth (Freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst f\u00fcr die weibliche Jugend) for six months' voluntary work near Glindow, close to Potsdam. The nature of her work at MGM\u2014the tedious cycle of film promotion and censor work\u2014made Libertas restless. On the 18th of July 1935, she completed her six months of voluntary service. Schulze-Boysen was so enthused by her voluntary service that she decided to write a book that was brutally honest, that described the daily fight for assertio, the status of women in the community and the fight for ideals.  She submitted the manuscript to the writer Ernst von Salomon, a family friend who worked at the Rowohlt publishing house.. Salomon reviewed the book and believed it was good enough to publish, but had doubts as to whether the Reich Labour Service would allow it to be published, while Rowohlt wanted to publish it for precisly that reason. Libertas wanted to submit the manuscript for review to the Reich Labour Service, but whether that actually happened is unknown. Salomon heard nothing further on that point.\n\nStarting in July 1935, Schulze-Boysen began working on Harro's magazine Wille zum Reich (\"Will to Empire\") as an editor and translator. The magazine dealt with cultural policy issues, but with the goal of undermining the Nazi movement with the magazine's own themes. In August 1935, Harro was given permission by the Ministry of Aviation (Luftfahrtministerium) to attend a series of lectures on the League of Nations in Geneva, and Libertas accompanied him. On the way home, the couple stopped at the Ch\u00e2teau de Muzot to visit the last home of the Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke as well as visit his tomb.\n\nIn the spring of 1936, Schulze-Boysen applied to leave the Nazi party by submitting a resignation request to the Reichsleitung der NSDAP in Munich requesting to leave.\n\nMarriage\nDuring Easter of 1936, Libertas and Harro got engaged. They  lived together for a year before getting married on July 26, 1936. The wedding took place in the chapel of Liebenberg Castle under a painting of Guido Reni, with Hermann G\u00f6ring giving away the bride. For their honeymoon, the couple visited Stockholm in Sweden, where Harro was introduced to Libertas' Swedish relatives, her sister Ottora and her sister's husband Count Douglas. Harro was on duty during the short honeymoon that the couple took between July 27th and August 9th, 1936.  He had arranged a language study trip from his employer and he had submitted a confidential report upon his return, that detailed the description and the constitution of the crafts in the bays. At the time, Libertas was unprepared for the fact that Harro spent more time looking at the military installations and the ships in the harbour than at her.\n\nFirst mission\nIn August 1936, the journalist Evan James, an English friend of Libertas's from her 1933 stay in England, lodged with the couple to report on the 1936 Summer Olympics. At the time, Harro wanted to give James the details on prisoner numbers from the Spanish Civil War, compiled from situation reports his office received,  so he could get them published by the BBC. However James refused, stating the source would be to easy to identify. Instead, Libertas translated the bombastic words from the first page of Mein Kampf, to warn him, to show him, that there would be war.  However, James didn't want to hear. Instead the couple show James the anti-Jewish notices in the shops but what is so obvious to them, that the Nazi consolidation of power will lead to war, isn't so obvious to James.   At the time Harro was dumbfounded at James attitude but gradually realised that his position in the Air Ministry could give him access to valuable information but he would need to rise in the ranks. They decided to invite G\u00f6ring to the Liebenberg estate, to hunt deer,  on 6 September 1936. G\u00f6ring's country home of Carinhall was next to Liebenberg Castle. In essence it was a charm offensive, led by Libertas, to get Harro noticed. Libertas was successful as G\u00f6ring made an enquiry to Hans-J\u00fcrgen Stumpff, who reported the Harro Schulze-Boysen was considered unreliable due to his political involvements before 1933.  G\u00f6ring replied that the \"...old things should be left alone\" and that Harro should be sent on a pilots course, enabling his career advancement. \n\nOn 1 October 1936, the couple moved into an apartment at 2 Waitzstrasse in Charlottenburg.  At the same time, their marriage ran into trouble. Due to pain in Harro's kidneys and the Swastika carved into his leg, he found lovemaking difficult. After sex, his urine would turn red. Libertas realised the marriage was in trouble and influenced by the views of her husband, returns her Nazi membership booklet.  \n\nDuring 1937 they held their first public picnic evenings and held further meetings every two weeks on a thursday night. Their first picnic evening of the year was held on 21 January 1937. Among the 30 odd guests were Gisela von P\u00f6llnitz and a doctor, Elfriede Paul who was the girlfriend of Walter K\u00fcchenmeister who had been invited on the advice of Elisabeth Schumacher\u2014wife of Kurt Schumacher who also attended.\n\nWriter and journalist\nOn the 12 January 1938, Libs met playwright G\u00fcnther Weisenborn who had been friends with Harro since 1932. As their relationship blossomed, Libertas and Weisenborn drew closer together, resulting in them both collaborating in writing a play Die guten Feinde (The Good Enemies). about the German physician Robert Koch. The plays premier was to be held at the theatre in Bremen in  November 1938, but was actually held on 1 March 1939. At the same time, Libs had signed a contract with Deutschlandsender for a production of a radio play  that was broadcast on 3 March 1939.\n\nIn April 1939, the couple moved into their new apartment at Altenburger Allee 19 in Charlottenburg, now the Westend.\n\nFrom July 1940 to 13 November 1941, Libertas wrote film reviews for the culture section of the National-Zeitung. The task was difficult as she could not write freely or criticize, as the paper was under the control of Joseph Goebbels' propaganda ministry and the reviews had to include written text from the Zeitschriften-Dienst, that described what could and could not be written about. Libs decided to cooperate in order to express herself and maintain influence. For films she liked, she would often write extravagantly, or in the form of a love letter. In other films that didn't find favour, she would write in a strict and formal manner. Originally a temporary position, it became permanent in the summer of 1941, but she became unsettled and decided to leave to try and achieve a film career. Her last article Resurrection the mask in art dance introduced the dancer Oda Schottm\u00fcller, to the general public and her successor as film critic was Adam Kuckhoff. Both were her and Harro's friends and both resisted the Nazis.\n\nResistance\n\nThe Spanish Civil War galvanised the inner circle of group in their discussions. Kurt Schumacher demanded that action should be taken and a plan, that took advantage of Harro's position at the ministry was formed. In February 1937, Harro compiled a short information document about a sabotage enterprise planned in Barcelona by the German Wehrmacht. The information was from \"Special Staff W\", an organisation established by Luftwaffe general Helmuth Wilberg to study and analyse the tactical lessons learned by the Legion Kondor during the Spanish Civil War. The unit also directed the German relief operations that consisted of volunteers, weapons and ammunition for General Francisco Franco's FET y de las JONS. The information that Schulze-Boysen collected included details about German transports, deployment of units and companies involved in the German defence. The group around Schulze-Boysen did not know how to deliver the information, but discovered that Schulze-Boysen's cousin, Gisela von P\u00f6llnitz, was planning to visit the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne that was held in Paris from 25 May to 25 November 1937. The couple, fearing instant retribution from the Gestapo, decided to leave Berlin for several weeks. On the 27 September 1937, Harro left for a treatment for kidney stones at a sanatorium in Bad Wildungen, while Libertas arranged a sea trip via a friend, on the cargo ship SS Ilona Siemers (1923) that left from the Hamburg port of St. Pauli, transporting coal to the Black Sea. She returned on Christmas Day 1937.\n\nIn 1938, looking to determine her fortune, Schulze-Boysen became a client of Anna Krauss, a well-known clairvoyant and fortune-teller.  Through Krauss, Libertas met Toni Graudenz, a neighbour. Her husband was John Graudenz. Schulze-Boysen introduced both Krauss and Graudenz into the resistance group.\n\nIn April 1939, Soviet intelligence officer of the GRU Anatoly Gurevich was ordered to travel from Brussels to Berlin to contact Harro Schulze-Boysen. He was hoping to revive Schulze-Boysen as an intelligence source and arrange communication with him via a courier service. Gurevich was given the telephone number of Schulze-Boysen and ordered to phone him and arrange a meeting somewhere in the city. He was not to meet him at his home, however. When Gurevich phoned, Libertas answered the phone. They met on the platform of an underground station, later moving to a cafe where Harro joined them.\n\nThe Kuckhoffs had known the Schulze-Boysens since 1938, having met them at a dinner party hosted by film producer Herbert Engelsing and his wife Ingeborg at their open house in Bettinstrasse in Grunewald. The Engelsing's were close friend of Libertas and started to engage them socially in late 1939 or early 1940 when Greta brought Mildred and Libertas together while on holiday in Saxony. Other friends who joined their parties and who became staunch anti-nazis, that included the actor Werner Dissel who they met in 1935, Albrecht Haushofer, Kurt Schumacher and his wife Elisabeth Schumacher, Elfriede Paul, Walter K\u00fcchenmeister,  the writer G\u00fcnther Weisenborn, the dancer and sculptress Oda Schottm\u00fcller as well as the actor Marta and editor Walter Husemann.\n\nIn January 1941, Schulze-Boysen attended the wedding of G\u00fcnther and Joy Weisenborn. While there she was surrounded by her friends but was deeply unhappy over the affair. Their arguments led their friend Ingeborg  to see them less and less as the summer progressed.\n\nWar crimes\nIn August 1940, the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda created the Deutsche KulturfilmZentrale (German Documentary Film Institute) whose purpose was to organise the production of ten to twenty minute long cultural films, that were to be shown in German film theatres, before the start of the main film, for the purpose of propaganda  Libertas applied for a position in the department of Kunst, deutsches Land und Volk, V\u00f6lker und L\u00e4nder (Art, German Land and People, Peoples and Countries) and was appointed on 1 November 1941. In the position she acted as a censor, reviewing films to determine if they adhered to Nazi Party ideology. Those that didn't she would reject; filmmakers who she found to be trying to innovative were passed. On her first day at work, she found her desk piled high with envelopes filled with photographs containing images of the work of the Sonderbehandlungen task forces. Joseph Goebbels had ordered the collection of photographs from the front so they can be used by Libertas to define themes for new cultural films. As part of her job, she had to continue requesting pictures from soldiers on leave. \n\nFor a long while Schulze-Boysen didn't know how to react to the material as it was so shocking. but in collaboration with her assistant Alexander Spoerl who was the son of the German author Heinrich Spoerl,  she decided to start gathering pictorial evidence of Nazi war crimes, in anticipation of using them after the war too show the extent of the genocide. However, the number of pictures in envelopes continued to increase as more and more were delivered. Schulze-Boysen decided to answer some of the letters she received, to collect more details for after the war. In one photograph she archives, contains an image of a little girl next to her older brother, mother and a baby. All of them are to be shot. In another letter she received, a soldier spoke in lyrical terms of certain insects that he loved and couldn't harm, the potato beetle and included a photograph of him about to hurl a small baby against the wall. In January 1942, she wrote to her mother-in-law Marie Louise, where she described the work, which she completes at home and described how it made her deeply unhappy and melancholic.\n\n+ gave up the ships journal in April 1941, Ohler 168 real\n+ June 1941 marriage problems, job offers outside Berlin, Ohler 170 real\n\nIn 1941, Schulze-Boysen became an English language lecturer to teach translators the language.\n\n+ Graudenz introduced 201 Ohler real\n+ Introduce Annie Krauss as well.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, Schulze-Boysen met Cato Bontjes van Beek an ardent anti-Nazi, while at a fair in Leipzig. Van Beek began to collaborate with Libs, in their resistance to the Nazi, by helping her write up the Nazi crimes in her archive.\n\n+Cato drops out, Ohler 205 real\n\nOn the 29 October 1941, Schulze-Boysen  received a phone call from the Soviet intelligence officer, Anatoly Gurevich, and she put him in contact with her husband.\n\nBy 1942, the unrelenting stress of the resistance work began to tell. In the spring of 1942, she confided in G\u00fcnther Weisenborn that for five years she had worked to resist the Nazis on behalf of Harro, but she found that she could not face the fear any longer. She yearned simply to live, in love and peace. On the 16 May 1942, she visited Vienna for several days to conduct a meeting with the Wien-Film film company. While she was away, the group protested the Nazi propaganda exhibition called The Soviet Paradise (German original title \"Das Sowjet-Paradies\") in Lustgarten, that had the express purpose of justifying the invasion of the Soviet Union to the German people. The protest took the form of  small stickers with a message Permanent Exhibition, The Nazi Paradise, War, Hunger, Lies, Gestapo, How much longer? that were pasted up in several German neighbourhoods.\n\nWhe she returned from Vienna, she discovered Harro in flagrante with the actor Stella Mahlberg with whom he had been having an affair since April 1941. She immediately demanded a divorce stating she would seek the legal advice from Herbert Engelsing but Harro convinced her to stay, informing her that they knew too much about the resistance effort. Harro Schulze-Boysen continued the affair until August 1942. Libertas found the lack of emotional support highly distressing.\n\nDiscovery\nThe discovery of the illegal radio transmissions by Soviet agent Johann Wenzel by the German radio counterintelligence organization Funkabwehr and his capture by the Gestapo on 29\u201330 June 1942 eventually exposed the group and led to the arrest of the Harnacks.  Wenzel decided to cooperate after he was tortured. His exposure of the radio codes enabled Referat 12, the cipher bureaux of the Funkabwehr, to decipher Red Orchestra message traffic. The unit had been tracking Red Orchestra radio transmissions since June 1941 and found Wenzels house in Brussels was found to contain a large number of coded messages. When Wilhelm Vauck, principal cryptographer of the Funkabwehr, the radio counterintelligence department of the Abwehr,  received the ciphers from Wenzel, he was able to decipher some of the older messages.  On 15 July 1942, Vauck managed to decrypt a message dated 10 October 1941that gave the locations of the Kuckhoff's and the Schulze-Boysen's apartments.\n\nArrest\n\nOn 31 August 1942, Harro Schulze-Boysen was arrested in his office in the Ministry of Aviation. Libertas had received a puzzling phone call from his office several days before. She was also warned by the women who delivered her mail that the Gestapo were monitoring it. Libertas's assistant Alexander Spoerl also noticed that Adam Kuckhoff had gone missing while working in Prague.  On the 7 September 1942, the Harnacks were arrested while on holiday.\n\nLibertas suspected that Schulze-Boysen was arrested and contacted the Engelsings. Herbert Engelsing tried to contact Kuckhoff without result. Libertas and Spoerl both started to panic and frantically tried to warn others. They destroyed the darkroom at the Kulurefilm center and Libertas destroyed her meticulously collected archive. At home, she packed a suitcase with all Harro Schulze-Boysens papers and then tried to fabricate evidence of loyalty to the Nazi state by writing fake letters. She sent the suitcase to G\u00fcnther Weisenborn in the vain hope that it could be hidden, and he tried to contact Harro Schulze-Boysen in vain.\n\nOn the 8 September, while on a train to visit friends in the Mosel Valley, Libertas was arrested. She was taken to the basement cells (German:Hausgef\u00e4ngnis) in the most dreaded address in all of German-occupied Europe, Reich Security Main Office headquarters at 8 Prinze-Albert strasse (Prince Albert street) containing department AMT IV, the Gestapo and put into protective custody (Schutzh\u00e4ftlinge) by them.\n\nIn prison, Libertas met Gertrude Breiter, the secretary for Libertas' interrogator, Kommissar Alfred G\u00f6pfert. Libertas believed that Breiter was hostile to her superiors, seeing her more as a friend than an agent provocateur Breiter told Libertas that G\u00f6pfert didn't have any serious evidence against her and due to her family connections with Hermann G\u00f6ring, her life would be safe. Libertas decided to confide in Breiter and talked with her more than a dozen times. In the course of their furtive conversations, Libertas told Breiter what she knew of the other prisoners, asked Breiter to deliver letters and asked for additional favors, primarily in the form of a typewriter to write poetry. In the three months Libertas was in prison, she wrote a number of remarkable letters and poems to her mother.\n\nWhen the Gestapo informed her of Breiter's betrayal, Libertas was overwhelmed with remorse, stating in a letter to her mother, \"I had to drink the bitter cup for now I learn that the person whom I had given my complete trust Gertrude Breiter had betrayed me.\" Her mother believed that Libertas had betrayed a number of the Schulze-Boysen\/Harnack group.  However, in an unpublished interview with David Dallin after the war, Manfred Roeder, the advocate who prosecuted the Schulze-Boysens in the Reichskriegsgericht, stated that Libertas never betrayed anybody. Roeder credited the Funkspiel operation the Abwehr ran against the Red Orchestra radio operators for providing the necessary clues to identify the resistance members.\n\nOn 15 November 1942, Gurevich was brought back to Berlin where he was asked by the Gestapo on 22 November 1942 to identify the name of a woman in a picture. He identified her immediately as Libertas Schulze-Boysen. This provided definitive proof to the investigators that she was actively involved in the work of her husband.\n\nTrial\nShe and her husband were brought before trial in the Reichskriegsgericht (\"Reich Court Martial\"). She was charged with \"preparation\" to commit high treason, helping the enemy and espionage. Her husband was charged with preparation to commit high treason, wartime treason, military sabotage and espionage. The trial ended on 19 December 1942 with death sentences for both her husband and her. Libertas Schulze-Boysen was executed by guillotine about 90 minutes  after her husband on 22 December 1942 at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison in Berlin.\n\nHonours\n The German writer  dedicated his 1950 novel, Memoiren eines mittelm\u00e4ssigen Sch\u00fclers (Memoirs of a Mediocre Student) to Libertas Schulze-Boysen.\n In the Berlin borough of Lichtenberg in 1972, a street was named after the Schulze-Boysens.\n The Libertas Chapel in Liebenberg Castle, where she married her husband Harro, is dedicated to her. Since 2004, a special exhibition by the Memorial to the German Resistance on the life of Libertas and the joint resistance within the Red Orchestra against Nazism has been on display here \u2013 documented with photographs and extensive writings.\n In 2017, two Stolperstein (stumbling stones) each for Libs and her husband Harro were laid in front of the steps of the entrance to the Liebenberg castle.\n\nSee also \n Arvid Harnack\n Hans Coppi\n List of Germans who resisted Nazism\n Resistance during World War II\n\nLiterature\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links \n \n Douglas family archive\n\n1913 births\n1942 deaths\nRed Orchestra (espionage)\nExecuted German Resistance members\nPeople from Berlin executed at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison\nReich Labour Service members\nPeople executed by hanging at Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison\nExecuted German women\nPeople executed for treason against Germany\nGerman people of Swedish descent","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135417}
{"text":"Robert Charles Morlino S.J. (December 31, 1946 \u2013 November 24, 2018) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who served as bishop of Diocese of Madison in  Wisconsin from 2003 until his death. He was the bishop of Diocese of Helena, in Montana, from 1999 to 2003. Morlino was widely perceived as a conservative bishop.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education\nAn only child, Robert Morlino was born on December 31, 1946, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Charles and Albertina Morlino. He was of part Polish descent. His father died while he was attending Scranton Preparatory School, and he was primarily raised by his mother and grandmother. Morlino then entered the novitiate for the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, and studied at Fordham University in New York, obtaining a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1969.\n\nMorlino earned a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Notre Dame in 1970, and a Master of Theology degree from the Weston School of Theology at Boston College.\n\nOrdination and ministry\nMorlino was ordained to the priesthood on June 1, 1974, and then taught at Loyola College in Maryland, St. Joseph's University, Boston College, Notre Dame University, and St. Mary's College. He also served as an instructor in continuing education for priests, religious, and laity, as well as director of parish renewal programs. \n\nOn October 26, 1983, he was incardinated into the Diocese of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Morlino there served as Episcopal Vicar for Spiritual Development, Executive Assistant and Theological Consultant to Bishop Alfred Markiewicz, Moderator of the Curia, and Promoter of Justice in the diocesan tribunal.\n\nIn 1990, he earned a doctorate in moral theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and became a theology professor at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, Michigan, where he expected to spend his life prior to his promotion to a bishop. He was also named rector of St. Augustine Cathedral in 1991.\n\nBishop of Helena\nOn July 6, 1999, Morlino was appointed the ninth bishop of the Diocese of Helena by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Archbishop Gabriel Higuera, with Archbishop John Vlazny and Bishop Paul Donovan serving as co-consecrators. Morlino selected as his episcopal motto: Visus Non Mentietur, meaning, \"The vision will not disappoint\" ().\n\nBishop of Madison\nMorlino was named the fourth bishop of the Diocese of Madison on May 23, 2003, by John Paul II. He was installed on August 1, 2003.\n\nMorlino supported the application of Summorum Pontificum in his diocese, and he celebrated the Tridentine Mass in several parishes. He ordered that the tabernacle in all the churches of the diocese should be moved to a central place of prominence. Morlino encouraged the faithful to receive Holy Communion on the tongue while kneeling, and he encouraged pastors to enlist exclusively male altar servers. One of his main objectives was to increase vocations to the priesthood in his diocese, and he helped raise 44 million dollars for the endowment fund \"Priests for Our Future\". The number of seminarians studying for the priesthood grew from six to 30 during his episcopate, one of the largest increases in the United States. Catholics in his diocese had divided opinions of him.\n\nA fire severely damaged St. Raphael's Cathedral in March 2005. In June 2007, Morlino announced that St. Raphael's would be rebuilt on its current site, reusing the steeple and other items from the previous building.\n\nMorlino was the past chairman of the Bishops' Committee on the Diaconate and Ad Hoc Committee on Health Care Issues and the Church, both units of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nIn May 2009, Morlino announced that the Catholic Multicultural Center \u2013 a building that fed, educated and supported many on Madison's south side \u2013 would close in two days as part of widespread Diocesan budget cuts. A handoff to local parish administration and fundraising drive was announced one week later.\n\nDeath \nMorlino had a cardiac event during medical testing on November 21, 2018. Robert Morlino died in Madison on November 24, 2018, at age 71.\n\nViews\n\nPro-choice politicians\nMorlino believed that canon law should be interpreted as requiring communion be denied to politicians who openly support legal abortion and euthanasia. During the 2008 presidential election, Morlino criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Joe Biden for their remarks regarding abortion on the television program Meet the Press. He said that \"because they claim to be Catholic,\" Pelosi and Biden were \"violating the separation of church and state\" and \"stepping on the pope's turf and mine.\"\n\nLGBT rights \nIn 2004, Morlino publicly expressed criticism of what he termed as Madison's apparent lack of a moral compass.  He said that the city existed below a religious \"moral minimum\" and had \"virtually no public morality.\" He specifically cited the popularity of the city's StageQ community theater company, a gay and lesbian theater troupe, as evidence of this view.\n\nIn 2017, Morlino arranged for a memo to be sent by his vicar general to all local priests, informing them that they may deny Catholic funerals to people who had entered into same-sex public civil unions or marriages \"to avoid public scandal of the faithful.\" The memo advised clergy to consider whether the deceased or the living partner was a \"promoter of the 'gay' lifestyle.\" To minimize scandal, the deceased's partner should have no public role in any ecclesiastical funeral rite or service. A petition seeking to remove Morlino as bishop generated support from thousands of people.\n\nDuring the clerical sex abuse scandals in the summer of 2018, Morlino wrote a five-page letter in which he decried the abuse of minors and described a \"homosexual subculture\" that facilitates homosexual sexual activities between priests and other adults. He criticized the alleged acceptance of behaviors the Church considers sinful by members of the Church hierarchy, writing, \"We must be done with sin. It must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable. Love sinners? Yes. Accept true repentance? Yes. But do not say sin is okay.\"\n\nMorlino wrote, \"There has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the  deplorable acts of pedophilia. That is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia \u2014 this despite clear evidence to the contrary. It is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\" Morlino decried clerical abuse of minors, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick's sexual harassment and abuse of adult seminarians, and an alleged network of sexually active gay priests; interpreters of the letter disagreed on whether he was conflating these three matters. Some interpreted Morlino as linking homosexuality with pedophilia, and countered by citing studies showing a lack of correlation between pedophilia and homosexuality. Conservative Catholics cited studies showing that the vast majority of victims were male and that many were not prepubescent. They therefore said that the problem was more closely linked to homosexuality than pedophilia. Morlino urged victims to report accusations to the police, and called for reparation as well as prayer and fasting to atone for the offenses.\n\nRuth Kolpack\nIn March 2009, Morlino dismissed Ruth Kolpack from her post as a pastoral associate at St. Thomas the Apostle Parish in Beloit, Wisconsin, citing breaches of orthodoxy. In a brief meeting with Kolpack, he asked her for an oath of loyalty and to denounce her 2003 thesis, which advocated women's ordination in the Church and inclusive language relating to God. He dismissed her after she agreed to the oath but refused to denounce her thesis.\n\nRights of workers\nWhen the Wisconsin Legislature was considering a budget proposal which would curtail the collective bargaining rights of public employees (later enacted), Morlino  distanced himself from the other Wisconsin bishops, writing \"The question to which the dilemma boils down is rather simple on its face: is the sacrifice which union members, including school teachers, are called upon to make, proportionate to the relative sacrifice called for from all in difficult economic times? In other words, is the sacrifice fair in the overall context of our present situation?\" Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki had issued a statement calling for Wisconsin legislators to abide by a \"moral obligation\" to fully consider the \"legitimate rights\" of public employees.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Madison\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Helena\nFaithful Catholics from the Diocese of Madison support their Bishop\nCritical Mass: Swimming in a sea of relativism, Bishop Morlino holds an eternal rope\nLawsuit: Bishop Demanded Names of Complaining Priests\nLawsuit against diocese draws strong but mixed reactions from downtown parishioners\nBishop Morlino's political positioning\n\n1946 births\n2018 deaths\nAmerican people of Italian descent\nAmerican people of Polish descent\nRoman Catholic bishops of Madison\nRoman Catholic bishops of Helena\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Kalamazoo\n21st-century Roman Catholic bishops in the United States\nPeople from Scranton, Pennsylvania\nCatholic Church in Wisconsin\nUniversity of Notre Dame alumni\nFordham University alumni\nSacred Heart Major Seminary faculty\nCatholics from Pennsylvania","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135418}

{"text":"Joseph Huntley (1775\u20131857) was a 19th-century biscuit maker and innovator, who lived in the English town of Reading. In 1822 he founded a small biscuit baker and confectioner shop at number 72 London Street.\n\nBusiness\nAt this time, London Street was the main stage coach route from London to Bristol, Bath and the West Country. One of the main calling points of the stage coaches was the Crown Inn, opposite Joseph Huntley's shop and he started selling his biscuits to the travellers on the coaches.  Because the biscuits were vulnerable to breakage on the coach journey, he started putting them in a metal tin. Out of this innovation grew two businesses: Joseph (the elder's) biscuit shop that was to become the famous biscuit manufacturer Huntley & Palmers, and Huntley, Bourne and Stevens, a firm of biscuit tin manufacturers founded by his younger son, also called Joseph. In 1838, Joseph Huntley was forced by ill-health to retire, handing control of the shop to his older son Thomas Huntley, who was joined in partnership by George Palmer.\n\nReferences\n Reading History Trail, Huntley and Palmers, Retrieved 10 October 2005\n\nj\n1775 births\n1857 deaths\nPeople from Reading, Berkshire\nPeople in food and agriculture occupations\nEnglish businesspeople","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135424}
{"text":"The Trinity School in Nottingham, England is a Catholic secondary school and sixth form with academy status for pupils aged 11\u201318. It is part of the Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Multi Academy Trust.\n\nThe School asserts that its main concerns are: 'academic excellence, good discipline and achievement in all the broader aspects of education within a happy and distinctively Catholic atmosphere'. In 2011 90% of students achieved 5 A*-C grades at GCSE level and 90% of students were accepted onto their 'first choice' course at university.\n\nAdmissions\nThe school is a faith school, and has restricted admissions. Its good academic results give it a high profile in the city, and places for the school will be limited. It is situated off Beechdale Road, a main thoroughfare, near the junction with Kingsbury Drive, between Beechdale (to the south-east), Aspley (to the east), and Bilborough (to the west). The area has many secondary schools, with Bluecoat Beechdale Campus neighbouring to the west, and Nottingham Academy for Girls nearby to the east. Woodlands School, a school for children with special needs, neighbours to the east. The north half of the school lies in Aspley, and the southern half is in Bilborough.\n\nHistory\n\nFormer Schools\nBishop Dunn School was a co-educational secondary modern school on Kingsbury Drive, and named after Thomas Dunn. St Catherine's Convent School was at the Convent of Mercy on College Street in central Nottingham near Nottingham Cathedral from 1846, run by the Sisters of Mercy. It became a grammar school in 1951. It moved to Beechdale Road in 1962, becoming the Loreto Grammar School for Girls, a girls' Roman Catholic grammar school. The site on Beechdale Road was then run by the Sisters of Loreto, also known as the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It took in catholic girls from all over Nottingham and outside the city.\n\nComprehensive\nIt was formed in 1975 by the merger of the grammar school and secondary modern. The grammar school site is now the upper school.\n\nAcademy\nThe school converted to being an academy on 1 July 2012, and is no longer directly funded or governed by Nottingham City Council. However the school continues to co-operate with the council in regards to admissions.\n\nTraditions\n\nThe school badge\nThe school badge, re-designed in 1988, encapsulates much of the school's credo and ideology. The cross is derived from the Bishop's cross. The fleur-de-lys represents the Loreto School and the Triangle the first symbol of The Trinity School. They are set in school colours of green, black, silver and gold. \"Ad Dei Gloriam\", their motto (\"To the Glory of God\"), sums up the driving ideology of the school.\n\nHouses\nIn year 7 pupils are allocated into four different houses who compete against each other in a range of activities: most notably the annual athletics competition and sports day. The school runs House competitions such as House Debate, Inter-house Drama, Modern Foreign Languages and Piano recitals.\n\nThe 4 houses are named after Saints of the Catholic Church.\n\n St.Alphonsa\n St.Lorenzo\n St.Maximillian Kolbe\n St.Teresa of Avila\n\nThe Music Department\nThe school has a thriving music department, which is recognised nationally as being one of Nottinghamshire and the UK's finest in a comprehensive school. The music department encourages children of all ages, backgrounds and abilities to take up an instrument through its 'Orchestra' classes and also through an abundance of extra-curricular music ensembles led by music specialists. The school's Orchestra classes, which are a Trinity signature, offer every student in years 7 to 9 the ability to learn and play an instrument. Orchestra lessons offer violin, recorder and multi-instrumental tuition. The school's tradition of having such a special and inclusive music department has gained the school national acclaim and separates the school from competitors which has been recognised by high-profile musicians, composers and politicians. Music's tradition at Trinity has enabled current and ex students to progress in their academic and music careers; notably Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black winner of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition in 2016.\n\nThe music department has a reputation for producing and helping towards some of the best results at A level in the school. The extra-curricular music offers are another feature that allows the school to stand out from the crowd, with groups on offer which include a brass band, concert band, chamber orchestra, senior and lower choirs, string ensembles, rock and blues band, guitar groups, music tech clubs and many more. The threat of funding cuts prompted ex-student Sheku Kanneh-Mason to donate \u00a33,000 to save cello tuition at the school in 2017. Sheku said of the school \"I have had amazing opportunities at Trinity School, and to see other children not have the same opportunities as I had would be a huge shame.\"\n\nIn 2020 former Trinity student Jacob Fowler, won the BBC Two TV show Little Mix: The Search with his band Since September. The band toured as the supporting artist for Little Mix on their UK tour in 2021.\n\nActivities\n\nTrinity School Show Band\nThe Trinity School Show Band was formed in 1997 as a traditional marching brass band with thirty eight members, developing into over a hundred members when it became a show band. They have taken part in competitions since 2001 when they entered the World Championships in Germany. They won the Colchester Band Contest trophy (Division Two) three times between 2006 and 2008. For the 2009 season, the band were placed in BYBA's top division. At BYBA finals, Trinity came first beating all the other bands in their division. Other awards include, Academy Brass 2006 (Division Two), National Championships (Division Two) in 2006 and 2007, and Ouse Valley Sounds MBC 2008 (Division Two).\n\nFollowing a year away from competing, for the 2014 season, the show band competed in Division 2 of the British Youth Band Association and won the first show of the season, at Music Revolution in Bradford taking Music Effect, Music Analysis, Field Wind, Field Visual, Field Percussion and Colour Guard captions.\n\nThe Trinity School Show Band ceased to exist in 2017.\n\nAcademic performance\n\nTrinity has achieved an outstanding academic reputation. Public examinations at KS3, KS4 and KS5 have all been to a very high standard. GCSE results have steadily improved, not just 5 A* to C benchmarks but also the numbers of higher grades including English and Maths. Each year most of the 100 or so Year 13 students leave with their first choice of University. [The actual raw data is on the DCSF performance tables web site, and the schools own web site]. This is coupled with excellent extra-curricular achievements in music, sport and adventure training which demonstrate the tenacity and ambition of the school. The school also works closely with its associated parishes, firmly within the Catholic ethos it seeks to promote. The school enjoys good support from parents and fosters excellent relationships with pupils, as is reflected and evidenced in the most recent Ofsted report of November 2008.\n\nAlthough Nottingham has many poor performing secondary schools, it offers good results at GCSE, regularly having joint-best results for the LEA's schools, with Fernwood School. Fernwood, similar to many secondary schools in Nottingham, does not have a sixth form. Trinity is the only 11\u201318 school in Nottingham to get above-average results at A-level, except the independent (fee-paying) Nottingham High School and Nottingham High School for Girls. Many schools in Nottingham have recently become academies.\n\nNotable alumni\n Paul McMahon left Trinity in 2001 to read for a law degree at Oxford University.

{"text":"Retouch is the act of producing scars on a stone flake after the ventral surface has been created. It can be done to the edge of an implement in order to make it into a functional tool, or to reshape a used tool. Retouch can be a strategy to reuse an existing lithic artifact and enable people to transform one tool into another tool. Depending on the form of classification that one uses, it may be argued that retouch can also be conducted on a core-tool, if such a category exists, such as a hand-axe.\n\nRetouch may simply consist of roughly trimming an edge by striking with a hammerstone, or on smaller, finer flake or blade tools it is sometimes carried out by pressure flaking. Other forms of retouch may include burination, which is retouch that is conducted in a parallel orientation to the flake margin. Retouch is often taken as one of the most obvious features distinguishing a tool from a waste by-product of lithic manufacture (debitage).\n\nThe extent of reduction, also known as the retouch intensity, is denoted by a measure of the reduction index. There are many quantitative and qualitative methods used to measure this.\n\nMeasuring retouch\n\nQuantitative measurements\nThere are three indices of retouch that offer significant inferential power in determining the amount of mass lost in the process of retouching. Despite particular weaknesses associated with each method, the following methods have been shown to be the most robust, versatile, sensitive, and comprehensive.\n\nGeometric index of unifacial reduction (GIUR)\nThis method uses measurements of flake thickness and the height of retouch scars to produce a ratio between 0 and 1 of the index of reduction. In the original publication on GIUR by Kuhn (1990), scars are measured at three points (t) along the retouched edge (usually at proximal, medial, and distal points) and then divided by the overall thickness (T) to produce this ratio. The equation is GIUR= ((t1+t2+t3)\/3)\/T. However, scholars have recently revised Kuhn's methods by measuring T at each point t is measured. The updated calculation is GIUR= (t1\/T1+ t2\/T2 + t3\/T3)\/3. The new method creates more data points and may erase biases caused by high variation in artefact thickness. Typically, higher GIUR values indicate more invasive or extensive retouch. Calipers can be used to measure the height of the retouch scar or a goniometer can be used to measure the angle of the retouch and the height can be calculated with the equation t=D sin(a), where \"D\" is scar length and \"a\" is angle of retouch. Limitations of the GIUR are its restriction to use on unifacially retouched flakes and that as values increase, they are less able to accurately represent mass loss, because once retouch meets or succeeds the dorsal spine, t\/T ratios decline\n\nInvasiveness index\nThis index divides both the dorsal and ventral surface of a flake into eight sections each and calculates a score of how invasive the retouch is. It is based on adding up individual scores from each of the eight sections (each section gets a score of 0, 0.5, or 1) and dividing the total by the number of sections. This index can be used on both unifacially and bifacially retouched flakes.\n\nInitial-\/terminal-mass comparison (ITMC)\nThis index estimates the initial flake mass through the use of laser scanners and the measurement of platform area and exterior platform angle. The platform must be fully intact in order to use this method.\n\nOther measures of retouch\n Ratio of ventral area to platform area\n Hafted biface retouch index\n Estimated reduction percentage (ERP)\n Ratio of retouched edge to total perimeter\n\nQualitative measures of retouch\n\nRetouch morphology\nThis consists of identifying the scar morphology of the retouch. There may be more than one type of scar morphology on a single flake. There are three types of scar morphology.\n\n1. Scaled retouch scars\n\nThese are short, become wider at their distal end, and along the flake edge have an acute angle.\n\n2. Stepped retouch scars\n\nThese are short, have stepped terminations at their distal end, and along the flake edge have a higher angle.\n\n3. Parallel retouch scars\n\nThese are roughly parallel to one another and run along the flake margin.\n\nRetouch direction\nThis is essentially the direction in which the retouch was removed. There are five common directions of retouch.\n\n1. Obverse retouch\n\nThis is retouch that is struck from the ventral surface, causing scars to show up on the dorsal margin. This happens to be the most commonly present retouch direction.\n\n2. Inverse retouch\n\nThis is retouch that is struck from the dorsal surface, causing scars to show up on the ventral margins.\n\n3. Alternate retouch\n\nThis is present when obverse retouch is apparent on one flake margin, while inverse retouch is apparent on the opposing flake margin.\n\n4. Alternating retouch\n\nThis is when obverse and inverse retouch are both present on the same flake margin, but on differing parts of that margin.\n\n5. Bifacial retouch\n\nThis is when obverse and inverse retouch are present on the same area of the same flake margin.\n\nRetouch location\nThis is quite simply a description of where exactly the retouch is located on the flake. The key here is to be very specific. The retouch extensiveness for each area should also be described. This entails whether the retouch is total or partial. Proper flake terminology should be used in these descriptions.\n\nEthnographic research\nThrough ethnographic research in Central Australia, Hiscock found that retouch may be conducted on a flake that is ultimately rejected as a tool for use. This shows that retouch may, in some cases, not be a sign of extending the use life of a tool. It may simply be an attempt to make a tool viable for use in the first place and can indicate that particular tool's unsuitability for use. This calls into question many of the basic assumptions made based on retouch and suggests that archaeologists may need to rethink exactly what retouch may mean.\n\nReferences\n\nLithics","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135426}

He has researched the subject of alcohol and drinking for over 30 years, beginning with his PhD dissertation investigation, and has written widely on the subject.\n\nProfessor Hanson investigates the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on health. He has amassed a large, robust body of evidence that shows the benefits of moderate drinking.

{"text":"CX is a noise reduction system for recorded analog audio. It was developed by CBS Laboratories (a division of CBS) in the late 1970s as a low-cost competitor to other noise reduction (NR) systems such as dbx disc and High-Com\u00a0II, and was officially introduced in 1981. The name CX was derived from \"Compatible eXpansion\", a feature of the technique.\n\n\nUse on vinyl LP records\nCX was originally designed by CBS as a noise-reduction technology for vinyl LP records, similar to the earlier dbx\u00a0disc (based on dbx\u00a0II) and High-Com\u00a0II systems, but, like the later UC system, it aimed at the lower-cost consumer mass market rather than high-end audiophile niche markets only. CX-encoded records required a special CX expander connected to a stereo system, in order to fully reproduce the CX encoded sound on the LP. However, in contrast to dbx\u00a0disc and High-Com\u00a0II, CX-encoded records, like UC-encoded records, could also be played without a decoder with a resulting (claimed acceptable) amount of dynamic range compression. CX being a 2:1:2 compander system, a noise reduction of 20\u00a0dB(A) was achieved for a resulting maximum dynamic range of typically 80 to 85\u00a0dB(A) (other sources claiming up to 95\u00a0dB(A) or even 107\u00a0dB). The theory of operation is described in .\n\nThe project was led by CBS Records group vice president Bob Jamieson and carried out by a team led by Daniel W. Gravereaux and Louis A. Abbagnaro. The label predicted that CX encoding would become standard on all new LP releases but this did not happen. CBS struggled to gain support for the system from other record companies. The process was controversial among CBS executives and unpopular with some artists. Classical guitarist Liona Boyd demanded that the CX encoded version of one of her albums be withdrawn because of perceived shortcomings, even though Jamieson claimed that CBS had the technical means to overcome such objections.\n\nBased on an UREI reference design published by CBS, many third-party builders of CX decoders used a dual operational transconductance amplifier 13700D made by JRC (today NJR), coupled with a pair of quadruple JFET operational amplifier chips TL084 in their designs. Among them were Telefunken with their RN\u00a0100\u00a0CX, RS\u00a0120\u00a0CX and RS\u00a0220\u00a0CX. The documented playback time constants of the decoders were slightly changed by CBS in 1981\/1982.\n\nIn 1982, the CX integrated circuit U2141B was developed by AEG-Telefunken, Germany, by Ernst F. Schr\u00f6der, Dietrich H\u00f6ppner and Kurt Hintzmann, the same team who previously designed the High\u2009Com noise reduction system, a broadband compander with up to 20\u00a0dB of noise reduction. Hitachi also offered dedicated CX chips named HA12043 (for CX\u00a014) and HA12044 (for CX\u00a020) in 1983.\n\nApproximately 70 CX encoded LP titles were released by CBS up to 1983 in the United States. Gasparo also released a number of CX encoded records. In Europe, many CX discs were manufactured in the Netherlands with the catalog number prefix \"CBSCX\". The albums in this series also came in standard, non-CX encoded versions. A total of about 150 CX encoded titles exist.\n\nThe implementation of a software decoder for CX is under consideration.\n\nUse on LaserDisc and CED VideoDisc\nWhile the implementation of CX with LPs was quite unsuccessful and short-lived, CX would later see success as the noise reduction used for the stereo analog audio tracks on the LaserDisc (LD) format. It was also used for the audio tracks on discs of the RCA SelectaVision CED Videodisc system.\n\nAll LaserDisc (and stereophonic CED) players manufactured since 1981, when the CX equipped LD-1100 was introduced, had CX noise reduction capability as a standard feature. Pioneer also released a stand-alone CX adapter R-1000 for use with their VP-1000, Magnavox's VH-8000\/8005 and the industrial players that were all released before CX was adopted. The first CX encoded LaserDisc was Olivia Newton-John's Olivia Physical released by MCA Videodisc.\n\nCX decoders made for LPs could not be used with LDs because the CX companding specifications for LaserDisc were changed, from 20\u00a0dB of noise reduction to 14\u00a0dB, along with moving the 'threshold' where compression\/expansion changes from 2:1 to 1:1 from \u221240\u00a0dB to \u221228\u00a0dB - other minor changes to the decoding time constants were made as well. In addition, some of the LaserDisc's FM audio encoding specifications were modified too, allowing more headroom and better high frequency response at high levels.  These changes were made because, at the time of CX's adoption on LaserDisc (1981), the vast majority of program sources used for mastering, such as 35\u00a0mm optical and magnetic film soundtracks, as well as the 2-inch IVC-9000 and the 1-inch C-Type video tape formats used for LaserDisc mastering, had signal-to-noise ratios low enough that undecoded playback would accentuate their noise to unacceptable levels.\n\nBy reducing the total amount of noise reduction and modifying other aspects of the CX system to better match LD's FM audio shortcomings, undecoded playback sound quality was maintained and vastly improved decoded sound was achieved at the same time.  The possibility of audible pumping or breathing artifacts during CX decoded playback were reduced as well.\n\nWhile CX greatly improved the audio quality of LaserDisc's FM audio tracks, its primary reason for adoption was to decrease the amount of interference between the right channel's FM audio carrier and the video carrier's first chroma sideband. Without CX, strict filtering during mastering and playback as well as keeping color saturation below 75% on the master were required to keep any interference below \u221235\u00a0dB, which ensured that no beats or other artifacts were visible in the demodulated image. Although CX improved the picture quality, it was not normally used on discs with mono audio. Pioneer Video, the main manufacturer of LDs at the time, required the studios to request CX and, since most did not know that CX improved the video quality of the finished discs or the audio of mono titles, CX was rarely requested. Due to this lack of knowledge about CX at the studios, there were many stereo titles released without CX encoding and, in fact, CX didn't become standard on all LaserDisc titles until the late 1980s. A look at Pioneer's catalogs as late as 1987 shows that the majority of titles did not have CX encoded analog sound - most were not digital either.\n\nFor the CED VideoDisc, since stereo was not added to the format until its second year on the market, RCA made CX a mandatory part of CED's stereo system - a disc could not be released in stereo without CX encoding - and the companding specifications were unchanged from those of the LP system due to the CED system's much higher noise levels than the LaserDisc format. Although RCA improved the plastic\/carbon formulation used to make discs, which lowered disc noise levels by 3\u00a0dB, and modified the mastering system, the CED format still required the full 20\u00a0dB of noise reduction that was achieved with the unmodified LP system.\n\nThe names given by CBS to the two different versions of CX were CX-20 and CX-14.\n\nUse in FM radio broadcasting\nCX was used in FMX, a commercially unsuccessful noise reduction system developed in the 1980s for FM broadcasting in the United States. FMX was intended to improve fringe area reception of FM stereo by adding a CX-encoded version of the L\u2212R (left-minus-right, or difference) signal modulated in quadrature with the conventional stereo subcarrier. About 50 stations utilized the system, but few FMX-equipped receivers were manufactured, and after FMX was accused in 1989 of actually degrading reception rather than improving it, support dried up and the system was abandoned.\n\nCX enabled equipment\n\nThese devices are known to support CX:\n\n Backes & M\u00fcller CX Decoder\n CBS CX Expander Model E-1016\n CBS Technology Center CX Compandor Model 9101 \t\n cm labs cm678 CX decoder\n Elektor CX decoders (DIY projects based on the LM13700D\/NE5517N and HA12044)\n Kort Elektronik Dynamik Expander + CX Decoder SR\n phase linear \/ aie CX Decoder Model 220\n Pioneer CX Decoder R-1000 (external CX\u00a014 expander for LDs)\n Popular Electronics \/ Phoenix Systems CX decoder by John Roberts (DIY project based on the CA3280)\n Radio-Electronics CX decoder by Joel Cohen (DIY project based on the LM13700)\n Soundcraftsmen Preamplifier Model CX4000\n Soundcraftsmen Differential\/Comparator Preamp-Equalizer Model CX4100\n Soundcraftsmen Differential\/Comparator Preamp\/Equalizer Model CX4200\n Telefunken RN\u00a0100\u00a0CX (external phono preamp with CX decoder based on LM13700)\n Telefunken RS\u00a0120\u00a0CX (belt-drive record player with built-in preamp and CX decoder based on the NJM13700D)\n Telefunken RS\u00a0220\u00a0CX (direct drive record player with built-in preamp and CX decoder)\n Thorens PCX 975 by Heribert Heise (external phone preamp with CX decoder, claiming a dynamic range of up to 107\u00a0dB)\n UREI CX Mastering Encoder\/Decoder Model 1181 (switchable compander for CX\u00a014 and CX\u00a020 with half-speed mastering option based on Allison Research EGC-101, claiming a dynamic range of up to 95\u00a0dB(A))\n CX decoder by Markus Holtwiesche (DIY project based on the HA12044)\n\nCX encoded vinyl records\n\nThe following vinyl records are known to have been produced in CX encoded editions:\n\n The Clash - Sandinista! - Epic Records - 1980\n O.M.D. - Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark - Dindisc, Virgin Records, Epic Records FE37411 - 1981\n The Clash - Combat Rock  - Epic Records - 1982\n Aaron Copland - Copland Conducts Copland - Columbia Records 33586\n Lacy J.

{"text":"Percy Alfred Scholes PhD OBE  (24 July 1877 \u2013 31 July 1958) (pronounced skolz) was an English musician, journalist and prolific writer, whose best-known achievement was his compilation of the first edition of The Oxford Companion to Music. His 1948 biography The Great Dr Burney was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.\n\nCareer\nHe was born in Headingly, Leeds in 1877, the third of six children of Thomas Scholes, a commercial agent and Katharine Elizabeth Pugh. He was educated privately, owing to his poor health as a child. He became an organist, schoolteacher, music journalist,  lecturer, an Inspector of Music in Schools to London University and the Organist and Music Master of Kent College, Canterbury (1900), All Saints, Vevey, Switzerland (1902) as well as Kingswood College, Grahamstown, South Africa (1904).  He was Registrar at the City of Leeds (Municipal) School of Music (1908\u20131912). In 1908 he married Dora Wingate, a talented pianist. That year he founded the magazine The Music Student in 1908 (renamed The Music Teacher in 1921), and continued as its editor until 1920. During the First World War he directed the Music section of the YMCA for troops at home and abroad. \n\nAt various times Scholes was music critic for the Evening Standard (1913-1920), The Observer (1920\u20131925) (immediately following Ernest Newman's departure) and the Radio Times (1923\u20131929). From 1923 up until 1928 (when he departed for Switzerland) he was making regular music appreciation broadcasts on BBC radio.\n\nHe was made an Officer of the Star of Rumania in 1930 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries in 1938. He was founder and general secretary of the Anglo-American Conference on Musical Education, Lausanne (1929 and 1931). Scholes and his wife came back to the UK in 1940, but with his health in decline they returned to Switzerland at the end of 1956. He ended his days in Cornaux, Chamby sur Montreux.\n\nWork\nScholes wrote over 30 books, mainly concerning music appreciation. His best-known work is The Oxford Companion to Music, which was first published in 1938.  Like Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1878-89) the Companion sought to reach out beyond professional musicians to the amateur as well. This work took him six years to produce and consisted of over a million words (surpassing the length of the Bible). Scholes was assisted by various clerical assistants, but wrote virtually all the text himself. The only exceptions were the article on tonic sol-fa (for which he was dissatisfied with his own article) and the synopses of the plots of operas (which he regarded as too boring). Although the Oxford Companion to Music was (and is) regarded as authoritative, the text of the first edition is enlivened by Scholes' own anecdotal and sometimes quirky style.\n\nHe was also the author of Puritans and Music in England and New England: A Contribution to the Cultural History of Two Nations  (1934).  In 1947 he produced the two volume, 960 page The Mirror of Music, compiling, enlarging and commenting on material published in The Musical Times between 1844 and 1944.\n\nScholes was deeply concerned with connecting music with a wider audience through musical appreciation in the tradition of Dr Burney, an influence he cited himself and the subject of his biography in 1948. Frank Howes (writing as 'Our Music Critic' in The Times) called The Listener's Guide to Music (1919) \"that masterpiece of simplification\". He recognised very early the possibilities of the gramophone as an aid to knowledge and understanding of music. His First Book of the Gramophone Record (1924) lists fifty records of music from the sixteenth to the twentieth century, with a commentary on each; a Second Book followed in 1925. From 1930 onwards, Scholes collaborated with the Columbia Graphophone Company in The Columbia History of Music by Ear and Eye; this comprised five volumes, each containing an explanatory booklet and eight 78rpm records specially made for the series, including Renaissance vocal and instrumental items performed by Arnold Dolmetsch and his family.  He also worked on the innovative 'AudioGraphic' project for the Aeolian Company creating richly annotated player-piano (pianola) rolls, having joined as Secretary the Honorary Advisory Committee on the Use of Piano-Player Rolls in Education, chaired by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, in 1925.  The AudioGraphic rolls were printed with music biographical and analytical commentary material and illustrations including woodcuts, photographs of drama and opera productions, and paintings, which could occupy over two metres of the roll.  These rolls were issued in England from around 1926 to 1929 and America from 1927 to 1930.\n\nStyle and temperament\n\"Nothing he put out was ever \"ghosted\"; all bore the individual stamp of the salty P.A.S style.\" wrote W.R Anderson in 1958. In his writing for this work, and elsewhere, Scholes never believed in holding back his personal views in favour of a neutral point of view. He is credited  with the description of harpsichord music as sounding like \"a toasting fork on a birdcage\"; when describing Handel and Bach, he said that \"Handel was the more elegant composer, but Bach was the more thorough\". \n\nScholes led the public denunciations of Arthur Eaglefield Hull when it was found that his book Music: Classical, Romantic and Modern (1927) was found to have borrowed material from other writers. How much of this was plagiarism and how much a mere careless, hasty failure to cite sources is not known, but the scandal left Hull very upset. He took his own life by throwing himself under a train at Huddersfield station on 4 November, 1928. Scholes also made enemies amongst The Sackbut group which included Philip Heseltine and Ursula Greville. Scholes' criticism of Hubert Foss' Song-cycle on Poems of Thomas Hardy infuriated Heseltine, who sent Scholes abusive letters, took to telephoning him late at night, and circulated a petition seeking his sacking from the Observer.  Scholes sought legal advice on this matter but took no action. Reviews of Christian Darnton's You and Music (1940) were generally positive until Scholes catalogued so many serious and obvious errors (such as \u201cBinary form may be represented by A.B.A.\u201d) that he presented the work as an elaborate joke to trap unwary reviewers. \n\nIn The Oxford Companion to Music some composers (Berg, Sch\u00f6nberg and Webern, for example) were described in somewhat unsympathetic and dismissive terms. His article on Jazz states that \"jazz is to serious music as daily journalism is to serious writing\"; similarly, his article on the composer John Henry Maunder states that Maunder's \"seemingly inexhaustible cantatas, Penitence, Pardon and Peace and From Olivet to Calvary, long enjoyed popularity, and still aid the devotions of undemanding congregations in less sophisticated areas.\"\n\nDeath and legacy\nScholes died in 1958, aged eighty-one, in Vevey, Switzerland, where he had been living for many years. Shortly before his death, his \"professional\" library was acquired by the National Library of Canada. This comprised approximately 50 linear metres of research files and correspondence.\n\nHis former assistant John Owen Ward revised the Tenth Edition of the Companion in 1970. Ward considered it \"inappropriate to change radically the characteristic rich anecdotal quality of Dr. Scholes' style.\" and left much of Scholes' distinctive work intact. In 1983 Oxford University Press produced The New Oxford Companion to Music, edited by Denis Arnold, which consciously tried to overcome some of the perceived deficiencies of the Scholes' work. This included taking a more eclectic line on music to be included, and resulted in a two-volume work of some 2000 pages. The 2002 edition, edited by Alison Latham, reverted to the original title, and single-volume format.\n\nPublications\n Candidates Self Examiner in Scales, etc. (1907)\n The Music Student (ed).

{"text":"\"Perfect 10\" is a song by English pop rock band the Beautiful South, released on 21 September 1998 as the first single from their sixth studio album, Quench (1998). It debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart, selling 89,000 copies during its first week of release, and is the band's last UK top-10 single to date. It received a platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry in 2021 for sales and streams exceeding 600,000 units.\n\nRecording contributions\nAs well as the contributions from band members, in the documentary Paul Heaton: From Hull to Heatongrad, songwriter Paul Heaton refers to contributions to the recording from Norman Cook and Paul Weller, who offered production assistance and rhythm guitar, respectively. Their contributions are also mentioned on the liner notes for Quench.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe verses of the song\u2014sung alternately by Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott\u2014are made up of a series of innuendos using clothing sizes and penis length to illustrate a loving relationship between two people who don't conform to modern stereotypes of physical perfection. The male vocal shows that although his partner is a little on the large side (\"but she wears a 12\"), she is a 'perfect 10' in his eyes. He also states, \"the anorexic chicks, the model 6, they don't hold no weight with me,\" preferring instead to, \"hold something I can see.\"\n\nLikewise, the female vocal references penis size in several places, suggesting that \"XXL\" is unnecessary (\"Every penny don't fit the slot\") and that even when all her partner has to offer is \"a poor poor 4, there ain't no man can replace.\"\n\nThe chorus to the song is sung by both male and female vocals, and confirms the theme of a happy and accepting relationship beyond ideas of conventional beauty, with Heaton and Abbott stating:\n\nCritical reception\nScottish newspaper Daily Record described the song as \"great\" and \"bitter-sweet\". Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian called it \"jazzy\", noting that \"Heaton's sweet-voiced 'I love her body, 'specially the lines', has one of the tenderest lines on an album full of memorable bons mots.\" Adrian Thrills from Daily Mail declared it as \"a rasping musical debate about sexual politics, neatly driven along by funky piano and honking sax\". Ian Hyland from Sunday Mirror rated the song nine out of ten, adding, \"The funkier sound is new but their observations on the important things in life are sharp as ever. Almost perfect.\" Johnny Dee from The Times remarked that it \"manages to be both funny and touching at the same time.\"\n\nTrack listings\n UK CD1 and Australian CD single\n \"Perfect 10\"\n \"If\"\n \"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\"\n\n UK CD2\n \"Perfect 10\"\n \"Loving Arms\"\n \"One Last Love Song\"\n\n UK cassette single\n \"Perfect 10\"\n \"If\"\n\nPersonnel\nPersonnel are adapted from the Quench liner notes.\n\n Paul Heaton \u2013 writing, vocals, production\n Dave Rotheray \u2013 writing, guitar\n Jacqueline Abbott \u2013 vocals\n Dave Hemingway \u2013 vocals\n Sean Welch \u2013 bass\n David Stead \u2013 drums\n Paul Weller \u2013 additional guitar\n Damon Butcher \u2013 keyboards\n Gary Hammond \u2013 percussion\n Kick Horns \u2013 brass\n Norman Cook \u2013 rhythm consultant\n Jon Kelly \u2013 production\n John Brough \u2013 engineering, mixing\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nIn popular culture\n\"Perfect 10\" was seen as a 'tour classic' by The Beautiful South and it has been stated by Dave Stead that, \"There are certain songs you just can't leave out...I think we would be lynched if we didn't play \"Keep It All In\", \"Don't Marry Her\" and \"Perfect 10\".\" This song also features in an episode of sitcom Phoenix Nights, where compere Jerry St Clair sings it in his own style. \"Perfect 10\" was the theme song of UK television series Fat Friends.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Perfect 10 song lyrics\n\n1998 singles\n1998 songs\nThe Beautiful South songs\nGo!

{"text":"Arthur Bernard Krock (November 16, 1886 \u2013 April 12, 1974) was a Pulitzer Prize winning American journalist. In a career spanning several decades covering the tenure of eleven United States presidents he became known as the \"Dean of Washington newsmen\".\n\nEarly life and career\n\nArthur Krock was born in Glasgow, Kentucky in 1887. He was the son of German-Jewish bookkeeper Joseph Krock and Caroline Morris, who was half-Jewish.  His mother became blind subsequent to his birth and Krock was raised by his grandparents, Emmanuel and Henrietta Morris until he was six years old. When his mother regained her sight, he joined his parents in Chicago, graduating from high school there in 1904.\n\nKrock went on to Princeton University but dropped out in his first year owing to financial problems. He returned home, and in 1906 graduated with an associate degree from the Lewis Institute in Chicago.\n\nJournalism\n\nKrock began his career in journalism with the Louisville Herald, then went to Washington as a correspondent for the Louisville Times and Louisville Courier-Journal. In 1927, he joined The New York Times and soon became its Washington correspondent and bureau chief. His column, \"In the Nation\", was noted for its opinions on public policy.\n\nFor example, amid the Hiss\u2013Chambers and Coplon spy cases and the investigation of David E. Lilienthal's management of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Krock observed: The persons whose names have entered the trials and investigations, fairly and unfairly, include none who was affiliated with the Republican party\u00a0... The ideal solution from the standpoint of these strategists [President Truman's] would be: (1) the acquittal of Hiss\u00a0... (2) a find by the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy that Lilienthal has been a good manager\u00a0... (3) repudiation by public opinion of the more sensational testimony before the third Un-American Committee; (4) at least one substantial trial victory for the Department of Justice. This is a large order. But the deep-thinking Democratic politicos think there is a good chance for it.\n\nDespite his stature, according to historian David Nasaw, from the earliest days of their friendship in Washington beginning in the mid-1930s, Krock became so staunch an advocate of Joseph P. Kennedy and his ambitions that he seemed to be all but in the pocket of the powerful millionaire (with one son who would later be U.S. president and two others who would contend for that office). Citing the correspondence between the two men in his authorized, yet highly researched and critically acclaimed, 2012 biography of Joe Kennedy, Professor Nasaw chronicles how it \"reveals something quite disturbing, if not corrupt, about Krock's willingness to do Kennedy's bidding, to advise him or write a speech for him, then praise it in his column\u00a0...\"\n\nLess than two months before the assassination of Joe Kennedy's son, President John F. Kennedy, in his October 3, 1963 New York Times column titled \"The Intra-Administration War in Vietnam\", Krock quoted a high-ranking official in the government as saying: The CIA's growth was 'likened to a malignancy' which the 'very high official was not even sure the White House could control\u00a0... any longer.' 'If the United States ever experiences [an attempted coup to overthrow the Government] it will come from the CIA and not the Pentagon. The agency 'represents a tremendous power and total unaccountability to anyone.'\n\nAwards\nOver his 60-year career, Krock won three Pulitzer Prizes:\n1935 Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence, for his Washington dispatches\n1938 Prize for Correspondence, for \"his exclusive authorized interview with the President of the United States on February 27, 1937.\"\n1951 Special Citation of his exclusive interview with President Truman\nThe organization now explains the special Pulitzer thus: \"The Advisory Board on the Pulitzer Prizes as a policy does not make any award to an individual member of the Board. In 1951, the Board decided that the outstanding instance of National Reporting done in 1950 was the exclusive interview with President Truman obtained by Arthur Krock of The New York Times, while Mr. Krock was a Board member. The Board therefore made no award in the National Reporting category.\"\n\nHe was awarded a French citation for his coverage of the Versailles Peace Conference.\n\nOn April 22, 1970, he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was married twice, first to Marguerite Polleys, daughter of a Minneapolis railroad official, from 1911 to her death following a long illness in 1938. They had one son, Thomas, who, during the Spanish Civil War, was one of a handful of Americans who fought in the war on the side of Francisco Franco.  In 1939, he wed Martha Granger Blair of Chicago, a divorced society columnist for the Washington Times-Herald, who had two sons.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Arthur Krock Papers at the Mudd Manuscript Library, Princeton University\n\n Search Arthur Krock at The Pulitzer Prizes\n \"Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Eight Journalists\" by Richard Nixon (April 22, 1970) at The American Presidency Project\n \n\n \n\n1886 births\n1974 deaths\nAmerican columnists\nAmerican newspaper reporters and correspondents\nThe New York Times Pulitzer Prize winners\nPulitzer Prize for Correspondence winners\nPulitzer Prize winners for journalism\nPeople from Glasgow, Kentucky\nWriters from Louisville, Kentucky\nAmerican people of German-Jewish descent\nPresidential Medal of Freedom recipients","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135437}
{"text":"For the Olympic horseman, see Hiram Tuttle (equestrian)\n\nHiram Americus Tuttle (October 16, 1837 \u2013 February 10, 1911) was an American merchant and Republican politician from Pittsfield, New Hampshire, who served as the 43rd governor of New Hampshire from 1891 to 1893.\n\nBiography\nHiram A. Tuttle was born in Barnstead, New Hampshire, on October 16, 1837.  His was raised in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, and educated in the local schools and at Pittsfield Academy.  He then began a business career, starting as a clerk in a clothing store and becoming successful in lumber, banking, mercantile enterprises, and railroads.\n\nA Republican, he entered politics in 1860 when he won the election for town clerk, giving the local Democratic Party its first loss in over 30 years.\n\nTuttle served in the House of Representatives (1873-1874).  From 1875 to 1877 he served on the military staff of Governor Person Colby Cheney with the rank of Colonel.  Tuttle was a member of the Governor's Council from 1878 to 1881.  In 1888 he was a Delegate to the Republican National Convention.  In 1888 he was also a candidate for Governor, but lost the Republican nomination to David H. Goodell.\n\nIn 1890 he was the Republican nominee for Governor.  In a three-way race that included a candidate of the Prohibition Party, Tuttle finished first.  The Democratic nominee, Charles H. Amsden finished second, but Tuttle did not have a majority, which meant the election had to be decided by the New Hampshire General Court.  The legislature chose Tuttle, and he served a two-year term, 1891 to 1893.

{"text":"Peter Richard \"Spider\" Stacy (born 14 December 1958, Eastbourne) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and actor. He is best known for playing tin whistle and sometimes singing for The Pogues.\n\nEarly life\n\nStacy left school at 16 after failing to attend regularly, and had a few jobs, including working at a carwash and as a used car salesman for nearly two years.\n\nThe Pogues\n\nStacy co-founded The Pogues, along with Shane MacGowan, Jem Finer, and James Fearnley, and appeared on all of their recordings. He is credited with suggesting the band's original name, Pogue Mahone (the actual Irish spelling being \"p\u00f3g mo th\u00f3in\"), which is Irish for \"kiss my arse.\" The band's original intent was for MacGowan and Stacy to share vocal duties, but Stacy decided to leave them to Shane after the first performance, opting to learn the tin whistle. Stacy still frequently contributed backing vocals and occasional lead vocals throughout his long tenure with the band. In addition, he is known for sometimes banging a pub tray against his head for percussive effect. After Shane MacGowan was fired from The Pogues in 1991, Joe Strummer filled in for him for a short period, after which Stacy assumed the role of lead vocalist. The Pogues recorded two albums with Stacy on lead vocals: Waiting for Herb and Pogue Mahone. Stacy resumed his original role in the band since they began performing reunion shows in 2001.\n\nOther appearances\n\nAfter the Pogues' break-up, Stacy briefly formed a new band, Wisemen\u2014soon renamed The Vendettas\u2014which included ex-Pogues Andrew Ranken and Darryl Hunt (as well as Kavus Torabi of The Monsoon Bassoon, Cardiacs and Gong). Stacy has appeared in both live performances and on recordings with many fellow musicians, including Astral Social Club, Filthy Thievin' Bastards, and longtime friend Steve Earle. In 2005, Stacy performed two songs, including \"Joe Hill,\" with Patti Smith at the Meltdown festival. In 2007, he appeared on The Dropkick Murphys' version of \"Flannigan's Ball\" with Ronnie Drew of The Dubliners.\n\nIn 2015 Stacy teamed up with Cajun music band Lost Bayou Ramblers to perform Pogues songs under the name Poguetry in Motion, later shortened to Poguetry. In 2018, he was joined by original Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan. In February and March 2020 Poguetry played an eight-date tour of the US.\n\nActing\n\nStacy has appeared in several movies and television productions over his career, including the Alex Cox films Straight to Hell (1986) and Walker (1986), as well as Eat the Rich (1987). Most recently, he appeared as \"Slim Jim\" Lynch in two seasons of the HBO series Treme. The series, which is set in New Orleans, was co-created by The Wire creator David Simon. Several Pogues songs had been featured on The Wire, and Stacy was introduced to both Simon and The Wire\/Treme writer and novelist George Pelecanos backstage after a Pogues performance in D.C. Stacy's friendship with Pelecanos later led to a 2009 performance featuring him and The Pogues at The Boogaloo, a London pub. Pelecanos read excerpts from his new novel, The Way Home, followed by The Pogues' first pub performance since 1983.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2010, Stacy and his wife Louise purchased a home in New Orleans, where they currently live.\n\nReferences\n\n1958 births\nLiving people\nThe Pogues members\nTin whistle players\nEnglish rock singers\nPeople from Eastbourne","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135439}

{"text":"The Stadttempel (), also called the Seitenstettengasse Temple, is the main synagogue of Vienna, Austria. It is located in the Innere Stadt 1st district, at Seitenstettengasse 4.\n\nHistory\nThe synagogue was constructed from 1824 to 1826. The luxurious Stadttempel was fitted into a block of houses and hidden from plain view of the street, because of an edict issued by Emperor Joseph II that only Roman Catholic places of worship were allowed to be built with facades fronting directly on to public streets.\n\nThis edict saved the synagogue from total destruction during the Kristallnacht in November 1938, since the synagogue could not be destroyed without setting on fire the buildings to which it was attached. The Stadttempel was the only synagogue in the city to survive World War II, as Nazi paramilitary troops with the help of local authorities destroyed all of the other 93 synagogues and Jewish prayer-houses in Vienna, starting with the Kristallnacht.\n\nIn August 1950, the coffins of Theodor Herzl and his parents were displayed at the synagogue, prior to their transfer for reburial in Israel.\n\nIn the 1981 Vienna synagogue attack, two people from a bar mitzvah ceremony at the synagogue were murdered and thirty injured when Palestinian Arab terrorists attacked the synagogue with machine guns and hand grenades.\n\nToday the synagogue is the main house of prayer for the Viennese Jewish Community of about 7,000 members.\n\nThe synagogue has been declared a historic monument.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, a terrorist attack near the synagogue left four civilians dead and 23 others wounded. It was not immediately certain if the synagogue was the target of the attack.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe synagogue was designed in elegant Biedermeier style by the Viennese architect Joseph Kornh\u00e4usel, architect to Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, for whom he had built palaces, theaters and other buildings.  Construction was supervised by the official municipal architect, Jacob Heinz.\n\nTwo five-story apartment houses, Numbers 2 and 4 Seitenstettengasse, were built at the same time as the synagogue, designed by the architect to screen the synagogue from the street in compliance with the Patent of Toleration, which permitted members of tolerated faiths to  worship in clandestine churches, but not in buildings with facades on public streets.    The synagogue is structurally attached to the apartment building at # 4 Seitenstettengasse.\n\nThe synagogue itself is in the form of an oval.  A ring of twelve Ionic columns support a two-tiered women's gallery.  Originally, the galleries ended one column away from the Torah Ark, they were later extended to the columns beside the ark to provide more seating.   the building is domed and lit by a lantern in the center of the dome, in classic Biedermeyer style.\n\nA commemorative glass made at the time of the synagogue's dedication and etched with a detailed image of the synagogue's interior is now in the collection of the Jewish Museum (New York).\n\nThe synagogue underwent renovation in 1895 and again in 1904 by the Jewish architect Wilhelm Stiassny, adding considerable ornamentation, and, in the opinion of architectural historian Rachel Wischnitzer, \"the serene harmony of the design was spoiled by renovations.\" Damage inflicted on Kristallnacht was repaired in 1949.

{"text":"A plumb bob, plumb bob level, or plummet, is a weight, usually with a pointed tip on the bottom, suspended from a string and used as a vertical reference line, or plumb-line. It is a precursor to the spirit level and used to establish a vertical datum. It is typically made of stone, wood, or lead, but can also be made of other metals. If it is used for decoration, it may be made of bone or ivory.\n\nThe instrument has been used since at least the time of ancient Egypt to ensure that constructions are \"plumb\", or vertical. It is also used in surveying, to establish the nadir with respect to gravity of a point in space. It is used with a variety of instruments (including levels, theodolites, and steel tapes) to set the instrument exactly over a fixed survey marker or to transcribe positions onto the ground for placing a marker.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe plumb in plumb bob derives from Latin plumbum ('lead'), the material once used for the weighted bob at the end.  The adjective plumb developed by extension, as did the noun aplomb, from the notion of \"standing upright\".\n\nUse\nUntil the modern age, plumb bobs were used on most tall structures to provide vertical datum lines for the building measurements. A section of the scaffolding would hold a plumb line, which was centered over a datum mark on the floor. As the building proceeded upward, the plumb line would also be taken higher, still centered on the datum. Many cathedral spires, domes and towers still have brass datum marks inlaid into their floors, which signify the center of the structure above.\n\nA plumb bob and line alone can determine only a vertical reference.  However, if they are mounted on a suitable scale the instrument may also be used as an inclinometer to measure angles to the vertical.\n\nAncient Egyptians used a plumb line attached to the top outer part of a tool resembling a letter E; when placed against a wall, the plumb line would indicate a vertical line. An A-frame level with a plumb line hung from the vertex was also used to find horizontal; these were used in Europe until the mid\u201319th century. A variation of this tool has the plumb line hung from the top of an inverted T shape.\n\nThe early skyscrapers used heavy plumb bobs, hung on wire in their elevator shafts.\n\nA plumb bob may be in a container of water (when conditions are above freezing temperatures), molasses, very viscous oils or other liquids to dampen any swinging movement, functioning as a shock absorber.\n\nDetermining center of gravity of an irregular shape \nStudents of figure drawing will also make use of a plumb line to find the vertical axis through the center of gravity of their subject and lay it down on paper as a point of reference. The device used may be purpose-made plumb lines, or simply makeshift devices made from a piece of string and a weighted object, such as a metal washer. This plumb line is important for lining up anatomical geometries and visualizing the subject's center of balance.\n\nSee also \nCenter of mass\nChalk line\nDeflection of the plumb line\nGravity direction\nVertical direction\nZenith\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n 60 oz.

{"text":"Southern Park Mall is a shopping mall in Boardman, Ohio, United States, serving the Youngstown\u2013Warren metropolitan area. It was developed by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation in 1970, and is now owned by Washington Prime Group. The mall, which is the largest shopping destination in Mahoning County, has approximately  of space. Its anchor stores are JCPenney and Macy's, with junior anchors H&M, Shoe Dept. Encore, and Planet Fitness.\n\nHistory\nThe Southern Park Mall was named after the Southern Park Race Track; a historic horse racing facility that was located approximately 1.5 miles south of the mall's present position. The horse track was bounded by Washington Boulevard, Southern Boulevard, and McClurg Road. One of the only remaining structures, the Southern Park Stable, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 10, 1986.\n\nOriginally planned as a joint venture with fellow Youngstown-based developer William M. Cafaro, the DeBartolo Corporation bought out the Cafaro Company's interest in the project in 1968. The mall originally had three anchor stores and totaled . Sears opened October 13, 1969 along with the Sears wing that included junior anchor Woolworth.  JCPenney opened April 2, 1970 and the Youngstown-based Strouss opened April 8, 1970. JCPenney and Strouss relocated from DeBartolo's Greater Boardman Plaza, located approximately one mile west of Southern Park Mall.  Other initial stores included Gray Drugs, Kroger, and Southern Park Theater.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-based Joseph Horne Company began construction on a fourth anchor unit on July 25, 1972, and opened July 30, 1973. The Strouss store was changed into Kaufmann's in 1986 when The May Department Stores Company merged its divisions. Dillard's acquired Joseph Horne Company with Horne's closing July 17, 1992 and Dillard's opening August 12, 1992.  Dillard's bought their store and adjoining land on October 13, 1993.\nIn 1997 the mall went under an extensive renovation, shortly after the DeBartolo Corporation merged with Simon Property Group. Simon spent $19 million making improvements to the interiors, adding a food court and a Cinemark Tinseltown USA 7 movie theater at the southeastern edge of the mall's property. It opened in 1997 and has 7 screens. Jillian's, which replaced Woolworth, was a tenant from 1999 to 2011. In 2006, Kaufmann's was re-branded to Macy's following the latter's acquisition.  In 2007, there was talk of demolishing,and expanding a portion of the Sears wing to bring outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment to the mall. Simon instead filled the space with Shoe Dept. Encore in 2011. In October of the same year, Fox Head opened in center court.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, news was released of the sale of Southern Park Mall by Simon Property Group to its spinoff, Washington Prime Group. On April 18, of that same year Gap, and Gap Kids, announced they would be closing. Following Gap's closure, Coach New York announced they too would be shuttering at the mall, among 70 set to close. On October 21, 2015, Bath & Body Works announced they would be expanding and remodeling their store at the mall. In January 2016, Zumiez and Vanity announced they would be coming to the shopping center. Zumiez opened in February next to Crazy 8 in the former Coach New York space. In mid April, Vanity opened in the former Wet Seal space, next to American Eagle Outfitters. As of May 4, 2016, Aeropostale filed for bankruptcy, announcing the location at Southern Park would be liquidated. On April 5, 2018, Sears announced that they would be closing their location at the mall in July 2018 after nearly 49 years. On February 13, 2019, it was announced that Dillard's would also be closing on May 14, 2019 which left JCPenney and Macy's as the only remaining anchors. On this same day, the Dillard's building was sold to a Cafaro Company subsidiary, Boardman SC LLC. The Cafaro Company owns the competing Eastwood Mall in nearby Niles, Ohio. In redevelopment efforts, Washington Prime Group tore down the Sears building in late 2019 and replaced it with the DeBartolo Commons, which added some smaller exterior storefronts whilst decreasing the overall square footage of the mall. DeBartolo Commons opened in 2021, adding recreational spaces and restaurants to the complex. Earlier in 2021, a Planet Fitness relocated to the mall, combining former tenant locations and creating a new junior anchor space on the mall's east side. On August 11, 2023, Windsor officially opened in the former Aeropostale space. As of May 2, 2023 the mall has an occupancy rate of 76%.\n\nAnchor stores\nJCPenney  \nMacy's  \nH&M \nPlanet Fitness \nShoe Dept.

{"text":"Sleepsacks are a type of bondage (BDSM) gear. Sleepsacks are primarily used to confine a person comfortably for an extended period of time. Similar to a conventional sleeping bag, a person climbs into a sleepsack and is usually zipped into it up to their neck. Generally sleepsacks are very tight on the body, much like mummification, which adds to the total encasement aspect of the experience.\n\nDesign \n\nSleepsacks are designed so the person is as immobile as possible, while offering a convenient alternative to the time-consuming wrapping of elastic bandages and\/or sticky mess of athletic tape associated with traditional mummy-type bondage. There is generally a pocket at the bottom that the wearer's feet go into. A durable zipper runs from below the knees up to the neck.  Generally sleepsacks have collars at the top which buckle around the neck, further securing the person in it. Instead of a single pull zipper most sleepsacks have triple zippers which allow for an opening anywhere along the length of the zipper. Sleepsacks with the zipper as described will also usually have internal arm sleeves. With arms in the internal arm sleeves the wearer is unable to have access to any part of their body.\n\nMaterials \n\nSleepsacks can be made from several different types of materials. Each type of material offers a different experience. The most popular material is probably leather. Other common types of sleepsacks are \nrubber, canvas, satin, Darlexx, and Neoprene. Of course virtually any flexible material, from denim to saran wrap, from wool to nylon stockings, or just a sleeping bag and rope, may be used to achieve the desired feel of total encasement. For many BDSM participants the type of material in which they are bound is as much or even more of a fetish than the bondage itself. Here are the most often used types of sleepsacks :\n\nLeather sleepsacks are generally very confining but do not stretch. If they are sized correctly they are very comfortable for long-term usage, and many bondage enthusiasts spend entire nights comfortably confined in them. In order to make the tightest fit possible, many leather sleepsacks have small D-rings down each side of the main zipper along the front of the sack, which allows the sack to be pulled tighter around the body using rope laced between the D-rings. This system of D-rings and rope lacing also protects the zipper from any stress that the occupant of the sack might exert on it. To further add to the confining aspects of the sleepsack, there are usually straps or belts that go around the body at intervals along the length of the sack, starting at the collar and going down to the ankles. To keep the straps in place and prevent them from shifting, they pass through larger D-rings down the sides of the sleepsack.\n\nLeather sleepsacks are probably the most durable type of sleepsack. They often come with bondage hooks or rings along the sides, at the shoulders, and at the feet for attaching restraints, tie-downs, or rope, to further secure the sack and occupant to a bed, bondage frame, or table. Leather sleepsacks can also be suspended upright or horizontal with the appropriate knowledge and equipment.\n\nThere are many options that can be built into a sleepsack, including separate zippers or removable flaps at nipples, a zipper from the lower spine to below the buttocks, attachable hoods, removable foot sacks, smooth leather lining, padding, internal arm sleeves, etc. Highly specialized leather sleepsacks have additional strapping and reinforcement allowing the sack and its occupant to be suspended in various positions safely.\n\nSince leather doesn't breathe, some individuals may sweat during their confinement. Depending on the amount of moisture present after use, wiping the inside of the sleepsack with a cloth may be necessary. In all cases, allowing the leather plenty of time to air-out and dry before being stored is very important, as moisture can lead to mould developing inside the sleepsack. Since leather sleepsacks can be very expensive, costing over $2,000, they must be treated with care to ensure the leather isn't damaged.\n\nRubber sleepsacks are also very confining but do have some stretch. This natural stretch is what causes rubber sleepsacks to be confining and tight. As with leather the sizing of a rubber sleepsack is very important for a proper fit. People who have a rubber fetish interest like rubber sleepsacks for obvious reasons.\n\nRubber sleepsacks do not disperse moisture at all. For this reason hydration is a very important consideration for people who spend any amount of time in a rubber sleepsack. Sweating can often be profuse even if the occupant is only lying inside it. All fluids from the body accumulate in the sack, which also makes the rubber sleepsack a choice for those who are also have a urination fetish. Rubber sleepsacks are easy to clean as they can simply be rinsed with water. Sweat leaking out from the neck, as well as through any zippers along the sack, can often occur while lying flat and should be a consideration.\n\nNeoprene sleepsacks offer a similar stretch and feel of rubber with less wear and tear damage due to the materials stronger properties. Neoprene does not stretch as easily as rubber offering a firmer restriction approaching that provided by leather sleep sacks. Neoprene is also a cheaper material and can be significantly less expensive as leather while having similar durability. Like rubber, neoprene does not disperse moisture so hydration is an important consideration for people spending time in a neoprene sleepsack.\n\nDarlexx sleepsacks are made of a spandex-like material. Darlexx stretches much like spandex but is much more durable. One main benefit of Darlexx sleepsacks is they are significantly cheaper than leather and rubber, and can accommodate a wider range of sizes due to how much it can comfortably stretch. Although still very confining Darlexx does not put as much compression on the body as rubber, making it more comfortable to stay in for longer periods of time.\n\nSatin sleepsacks have no ability to stretch, are somewhat breathable, but lack the durability of the other more common materials used for sleepsack construction. Given the low durability aspect, satin sleepsacks are rarely marketed and are generally home-made, but  BDSM enthusiasts with a fetish for satin, or for that matter any other particular fabric, may find its well worth the time and effort creating their own.\n\nSleepsacks in BDSM culture \n\nSleepsacks are an effective way to secure somebody comfortably, but also tightly, for long periods of time. Generally someone will need to be assisted into and out of a sleepsack by another person. There are neck-entry type sleepsacks which are open at the top and do not have a full zipper. These types of sleepsacks are good for those who want to have a similar experience on their own.\n\nThe immobility that sleepsacks cause to the occupant is a major reason they are popular. Sleepsacks also provide a great way to secure someone for many types of bondage and BDSM play, which may or may not include sexual activity.\n\nSafety considerations \n\nAs with any type of bondage, there are considerations that must be taken prior to entry into sleepsack bondage.\n\n Never leave someone alone. Should any type of unforeseen circumstance arise (such as fire, police raid, etc.) it will be impossible for the person in the sleepsack to get out.\n Hydration. As in any type of long-term bondage and especially in rubber, dehydration is a major and often underestimated problem.\n Watch the zipper. Since most people who want to be in a sleepsack also will want to be naked, making sure all body parts are away from the zipper is obvious but important enough to mention.\n Circulation issues. A general rule of bondage is the person being restrained should change positions about once every hour to prevent circulation problems. Sleepsacks are often an exception to this rule as the body is held in a position to allow for normal circulation. That said there are still opportunities for problems with extended time in a sleepsack. Often issues arise with the shoulder area being overly compressed or the arms not fitting properly into the sleeves. Preventing this from getting to be a real problem goes back to the #1 rule of not being left alone.\n Safeword. Also a general rule of bondage\/BDSM play, having a safeword available for someone to use when they really need to be released is very important.\n\nAppeal \n\n Power exchange. Giving up control of a situation to someone else.\n Tactile sensations. The tactile feeling of the material involved.\n Loss of control. The feeling of restraint and helplessness.\n Comfort. Comfortable for long-term bondage; many fantasies of waking up in bondage are satisfied by falling asleep then waking up in a sleepsack.\n Ease of use.

{"text":"Trusted Information Systems (TIS) was a computer security research and development company during the 1980s and 1990s, performing computer and communications (information) security research for organizations such as NSA, DARPA, ARL, AFRL, SPAWAR, and others.\n\nHistory\n\nTIS was founded in 1983 by NSA veteran Steve Walker, and at various times employed notable information security experts including David Elliott Bell, Martha Branstad, John Pescatore, Marv Schaefer, Steve Crocker, Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, John Williams, Steve Lipner and Carl Ellison. TIS was headquartered in Glenwood, Maryland, in a rural location.  The company was started in Walker's basement on Shady Lane in Glenwood, MD.  As the company grew, rather than move to Baltimore or the Washington D.C. suburbs, a small office building was constructed on land next to Walker's new home on Route 97.\n\nProducts\n\nTIS projects included as the following:\n Trusted Xenix, the first commercially available B2 operating system; \n Trusted Mach, a research project that influenced DTOS and eventually SELinux; \n Domain and Type Enforcement (DTE) which likewise influenced SELinux; \n FWTK Firewall Toolkit (the first open source firewall software) in 1993;\n First whitehouse.gov e-mail server was hosted at TIS headquarters from June 1 of 1993 to January 20 of 1995;\n Gauntlet Firewall in 1994, one of the first commercial firewall products, with broad range of Internet Standards, including S\/MIME, SNMP, DNS, DNSSEC, and many others. This Firewall became the inception of the third generation firewall;\n IP Security (IPSec) product in late 1994, known as the first IPSec VPN commercial product in IT history;\n Encryption Recovery technology integrated with IPSEC, ISAKMP, IKE, and RSA.\n\nTIS's operating system work directly affected BSD\/OS, which the Gauntlet Firewall and IPSec was based on, as well as Linux, FreeBSD, HP UX, Sun OS, Darwin, and others.\n\nPost company\n \nThe company went public in 1996\nand soon afterwards attempted to acquire PGP Inc.; it was instead acquired in 1998 by Network Associates (NAI), which later became McAfee, who had already bought PGP Inc. in 1997. The security research organization became NAI Labs and the Gauntlet engineering and development organization was folded into Network Associates' engineering and development.\n\nNAI Labs went through a couple of branding changes which complemented Network Associates' branding efforts. In 2001 the name was changed to Network Associates Laboratories to better match the corporate identity. Then, in 2002-2003, there was a major branding initiative by Network Associates culminating in selection of the flag brand, McAfee. As a result, the security research organization became McAfee Research.\n\nIn 2003, SPARTA, Inc., an employee-owned company, acquired the Network Security branch of McAfee Research.\n\nIn 2005, SPARTA acquired the remaining branches of McAfee Research, which were organized into the Security Research Division (SRD) of the Information Systems Security Operation (ISSO).\n\nIn 2008, Cobham, plc, a British aerospace company, acquired SPARTA. There have been no organizational changes to SRD or ISSO that affect the security research.\n\nOn a separate path, TIS's primary commercial product, the Gauntlet Firewall, was acquired in 1999 from McAfee by Secure Computing Corporation (SCC), that used to be one of TIS's major competitors, because at the time McAfee wasn't interested in being a firewall vendor.\nThe code base was integrated with Secure Computing's firewall product and branded Sidewinder Firewall, which then returned to McAfee when Secure Computing was acquired by them in 2008, and re-branded McAfee Enterprise Firewall. The end of this product line came in 2013, following McAfee's acquisition of another major firewall vendor, Finland-based Stonesoft. McAfee announced in October 2013 the intention to migrate their existing installed base of firewalls to Stonesoft's own Stonegate.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n LinkedIn Alumni Group\n Firewall Toolkit Archive\n Stephen Walker Congressional Testimony\n\nComputer security software companies\nDefunct software companies of the United States\nSoftware companies based in Maryland\nMcAfee\nDefunct companies based in Maryland\nSoftware companies established in 1983\nTechnology companies disestablished in 1998\n1983 establishments in Maryland\n1998 disestablishments in Maryland","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135445}
{"text":"The Kansas Jayhawks, commonly referred to as simply KU or Kansas, are the athletic teams that represent the University of Kansas. KU is one of three schools in the state of Kansas that participate in NCAA Division I. The Jayhawks are also a member of the Big 12 Conference. KU athletic teams have won twelve NCAA Division I championships: four in men's basketball, one in men's cross country, three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, and one in women's outdoor track and field. KU basketball also has two Helms Foundation National Titles.\n\nMascot\n\nOrigins of \"Jayhawk\"\n\nThe name \"Jayhawk\" comes from the Kansas Jayhawker militias during the Bleeding Kansas era of the American Civil War.\n\nThe origin of the term likely goes back as far as the Revolutionary War, when it was reportedly used to describe a group associated with American Founding Father and patriot John Jay, who served in the American Revolution as well as the 1st Chief Justice of the United States as a member of the right wing Federalist Party. Jay believed in the abolition of slavery and has been described by historians as a \"Christian Nationalist\" and \"among the most orthodox of Christians,\" according to Cambridge University and Oxford University professor Daniel Dreisbach and that America should be governed by Christians. In 1816, Jay wrote, \"Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.\" In 1776, prior to America's founding, Jay condemned slavery as a moral evil, and would be quoted as saying, \"The Holy Gospels are yet to be preached to these western regions, and we have the highest reason to believe that the Almighty will not suffer slavery and the gospel to go hand in hand. It cannot, it will not be.\"\n\nBecause of his positions on the immorality of slavery and the need for Christianity in government, many dubbed the political and militia groups that arose over the next century that were largely Christian and militantly anti-slavery as \"Jayhawkers.\" The name became synonymous with the state of Kansas due to many of the founders being Federalist settlers that moved to Kansas Territory from the east. The term became part of the lexicon of the Missouri-Kansas border in about 1858, during the Kansas territorial period, as these militia groups began to grow in Kansas.\n\nAnother historian of the territorial period described the jayhawkers as bands of men that were willing to fight, kill, and rob for a variety of motives that included defense against pro-slavery \"Border Ruffians\", abolition of slavery, driving pro-slavery settlers from Kansas Territory and their claims of land, Christianity, revenge, or plunder and personal profit.\n\nIn September 1861, the town of Osceola, Missouri was burned to the ground by Jayhawkers during the Sacking of Osceola. On the 150th anniversary of that event in 2011, the town asked the University of Kansas to remove the Jayhawk as its mascot. The university refused.\n\nOver time, proud of their state's contributions to the end of slavery and the preservation of the Union, Kansans embraced the \"Jayhawker\" term. The term came to be applied to people or items related to Kansas. When the University of Kansas fielded their first football team in 1890, like many universities at that time, they had no official mascot. They used many different independent mascots, including a pig. Eventually, sometime during the 1890s, the team was referred to as the Jayhawkers by the student body. Over time, the name was gradually supplanted by its shorter variant, and KU's sports teams are now almost exclusively known as the Jayhawks. The Jayhawk appears in several Kansas cheers, most notably, the \"Rock Chalk, Jayhawk\" chant in unison before and during games. In the traditions promoted by KU, the jayhawk is said to be a combination of two birds, \"the blue jay, a noisy, quarrelsome thing known to rob other nests, and the sparrow hawk, a stealthy hunter.\"\n\nThe term Jayhawker was made famous in Clint Eastwood\u2019s movie The Outlaw Josey Wales. An older Kansas couple comes into a general store in Texas. The checker says, \u201cThe wheat is from Kansas and the molasses comes from Missouri.\u201d Grandma says, \u201cWell sir we'll do without the molasses, anything from Missouri has a taint about it.\u201d Grandpa says, \u201cNow, Grandma, you\u2019ve got to tread lightly now that we\u2019re here in Texas. Lot of nice elements from Missouri coming West.\u201d Grandma responds, \u201cNever heard of nice things from Missouri coming West, and treading lightly is not my way. We\u2019re from Kansas, Jayhawkers and proud of it.\u201d\n\nThe link between the term \"Jayhawkers\" and any specific kind of mythical bird, if it ever existed, had been lost or at least obscured by the time KU's bird mascot was invented in 1912. The originator of the  first bird mascot, Henry Maloy, struggled for over two years to create a pictorial symbol for the team, until hitting upon the bird idea. As explained by Mr. Maloy, \"the term \u2018jayhawk\u2019 in the school yell was a verb and the term \u2018jayhawkers\u2019 was the noun.\" KU's current Jayhawk tradition largely springs from Frank W. Blackmar, a KU professor. In his 1926 address on the origin of the Jayhawk, Blackmar specifically referenced the blue jay and sparrow hawk. Blackmar's address served to soften the link between KU's athletic team moniker and the Jayhawkers of the Kansas territorial period, and helped explain the relatively recently invented Jayhawk pictorial symbol with a myth that appears to have been of even more recent fabrication. More recently, however, the University and KU fans have again embraced the history of the Jayhawker moniker, with the football team, among other Varsity teams, donning civil war themed uniforms.\n\nCostume mascots\n\nJayhawks Big Jay and Baby Jay are the costume mascots used by the University of Kansas.\n\nAnother Jayhawk costume mascot was Centennial Jay, or C Jay. C Jay was created by student cartoonist Henry Maloy and featured in the University Daily Kansan in 1912. Maloy's depiction of the Jayhawk helped answer the question of what the mythical bird would look like. When asked why he gave the bird shoes Maloy responded, \"Why? For kicking opponents, of course.\" C Jay was reintroduced as a full-sized mascot on February 25, 2012 in the final Border War against Missouri to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Jayhawk. C Jay was used only in 2012 for the 100-year anniversary of the original Jayhawk design.\n\nSports sponsored\n\nThe University of Kansas officially sponsors 16 sports: 6 men's and 8 women's. There are also club-level sports for rugby, ice hockey, and men's volleyball. The school used to sponsor a wrestling team, though the sport was discontinued during the 1960s.\n\nBasketball\n\nMen's basketball\n\nThe Jayhawks men's basketball program is one of the most successful and prestigious programs in the history of college basketball. The Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game, James Naismith. The program has produced some of the game's greatest professional players (including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, and Paul Pierce, and most successful coaches (including Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Ralph Miller, Dutch Lonborg, John McLendon, Larry Brown, Dean Smith, Roy Williams, and Bill Self). The program has enjoyed considerable national success, having been retrospectively awarded Helms Foundation titles for the 1922 and 1923 seasons, winning NCAA national championships in 1952, 1988, 2008, and 2022, and playing in 16 Final Fours, and is one of only three programs to win more than 2,000 games. In Street & Smith's Annual list of 100 greatest college basketball programs of all time in 2005, KU ranked 4th.\n\nWomen's basketball\n\nKansas first fielded a women's team during the 1968\u201369 season. For thirty-one seasons (1973\u20132004) the women's team was coached by Marian Washington, who led the team to three Big Eight championships, one Big 12 Championship, six conference tournament championships, eleven NCAA Tournament appearances and four AIAW Tournament appearances. The team's best post-season result was a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 1998. Bonnie Henrickson served as head coach from 2004 to 2015, until she was fired in March 2015. Brandon Schneider was hired to replace Henrickson in April 2015.\n\nFootball\n\nKU began playing football in 1890. The football team has had notable alumni including Gale Sayers, a two-time All-American who later enjoyed an injury-shortened yet Hall of Fame career with the Chicago Bears; John Riggins, another Pro Football Hall of Famer and Super Bowl XVII MVP with the Washington Redskins; Pro Football Hall of Famer for the Cleveland Browns, Mike McCormack. Additional notable former Jayhawks John Hadl, Curtis McClinton, Dana Stubblefield, Bobby Douglass, Nolan Cromwell, and current NFL cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. The Jayhawks have appeared three times in the Orange Bowl, 1948, 1969 and 2008, winning in 2008. The team currently plays in Memorial Stadium (capacity 50,071), the seventh oldest college football stadium in the nation, which opened in 1921. Clint Bowen was named interim head coach after Charlie Weis was fired September 28, 2014. On December 5, 2014, David Beaty was announced as the next head football coach.\n\nBaseball\n\nKansas baseball began in 1880 and has produced notable players such as Bob Allison and Steve Renko. The team has appeared in five NCAA tournaments (1993, 1994, 2006, 2009, 2014) and one College World Series (1993).\n\nSoftball\nThe Jayhawks softball team has appeared in seven Women's College World Series, including five straight from 1973\u201377, as well as 1979 and 1992.\n\nGolf\nIn 1949, Marilynn Smith won the women's individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS) \u2014 which later evolved into the current NCAA women's golf championship).\n\nNotable non-varsity sports\n\nRugby\nFounded in 1964, Kansas Jayhawks Rugby Football Club plays college rugby in the Division 1 Heart of America conference against its many of its traditional Big 8 \/ Big 12 rivals such as Kansas State and Missouri. Kansas finished the 2011 year ranked 24th. Kansas rugby has embarked on international tours since 1977, playing in Europe, New Zealand, South Africa, Belgium, Holland, Scotland, England, Ireland and Argentina.\nThe team plays its matches at the Westwick Rugby Complex, which was funded by $350,000 in alumni donations. Kansas often hosts the annual Heart of America sevens tournament played every September, the winner of which qualifies for the USA Rugby sevens national championship. Notable University of Kansas rugby all-Americans are: Pete Knudsen 1986, Paul King 1989\u201390, Anthony Rio 1992, Philip Olson 1993 all American, Joel Foster 1993, Collin Gotham 1993. In 2022 the club played in the USA Rugby D1AA spring national championship game, falling to Fresno State, 22\u201317.\n\nIce hockey\nCompeting in the ACHA, the Kansas Jayhawks Club Ice Hockey team has seen a resurgence in popularity since the team started scheduling games against historical rivals Missouri and Nebraska, starting on an annualized basis in 2013. The team is coached by Andy McConnell.\n\nThe team's primary logo is the traditional Kansas Jayhawk logo, with the secondary logo paying homage to the Vancouver Canucks classic logo, with the outline of the state of Kansas having a hockey stick running through the middle of it.\n\nChampionships\n\nConference championships and titles\nBig 12 Conference champions have the best conference regular season record, and titles are awarded to the winner of the postseason championship tournament. In all sports combined,  the Jayhawks have won total of 169 conference titles all-time, 24 championships since joining the Big 12. Approximately one third of those are from the Men's basketball.\n\n Men's basketball\nThe Jayhawks have won or shared an NCAA record 64 conference championships since they joined their first conference in 1907. The Jayhawks have belonged to the Big 12 Conference since it was formed, before the 1996\u201397 season, and dominated it, winning 12 straight conference titles dating back to 2005. Before that, the Jayhawks have belonged to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association from the 1907\u201308 to 1927\u201328 seasons, the Big Six Conference from 1928\u201329 to 1946\u201347, the Big Seven Conference from 1947\u201348 to 1957\u201358, the Big Eight Conference from 1958\u201359 up until the end of the 1995\u201396 season. The Big Six and Big Seven conferences were actually the more often used names of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which existed under that official name until 1964, when it was changed to the Big Eight.\n\nMissouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (13)\n 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1914, 1915, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927\n\nBig Six Conference (12)\n 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1946\n\nBig Seven Conference (5)\n 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957\n\nBig Eight Conference (13)\n 1960, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1986, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996\n\nBig 12 Conference (21)\n 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2022, 2023\n\nIn addition to the 64 regular season conference championships, the Jayhawks have also won 29 conference tournament championships:\n\nBig 7 Holiday Tournament (4)\n 1951, 1953, 1956, 1957,\n\nBig 8 Holiday Tournament (9)\n1962, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1974, 1977, 1978,\n\nBig 8 Postseason Tournament (4)\n1981, 1984, 1986, 1992,\n\nBig 12 Postseason Tournament (12)\n1997, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018, 2022\n\n Women's basketball\n 1979 \u2013 Big 8 tournament champion\n 1980 \u2013 Big 8 tournament champion\n 1981 \u2013 Big 8 tournament champion\n 1987 \u2013 Big 8 regular season and tournament champion\n 1988 \u2013 Big 8 tournament champion\n 1992 \u2013 Big 8 regular season champion\n 1993 \u2013 Big 8 tournament champion\n 1996 \u2013 Big 8 regular season champion\n 1997 \u2013 Big 12 champion\n\n Baseball\n 1921 \u2013 MVIAA champion\n 1922 \u2013 MVIAA champion\n 1923 \u2013 MVIAA champion\n 1949 \u2013 Big 7 Conference champion\n 2006 \u2013 Big 12 tournament champion\n\n Soccer\n 2004 \u2013 Big 12 regular season co-champion\n\n Softball\n 2006 \u2013 Big 12 tournament champion\n\n Men's indoor track and field\n 1922, 1923, 1934, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983\n\n Women's indoor track and field\n 2013\n\n Men's outdoor track and field\n 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1931, 1934, 1946, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1982\n\n Women's outdoor track and field\n 2013\n\n Men's cross country\n 1928, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1968, 1969\n\n Men's golf\n 1999\n\n Tennis\n 1979, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2019\n\n Women's volleyball\n 2016\n\nNational Championships\nKansas has won 12 NCAA team national championships and 3 non-NCAA National Championships.

The series between Kansas and Kansas State is known as the Sunflower Showdown.\n\nMissouri Tigers (Border War)\n\nThe 160-year-old rivalry between Kansas and Missouri began with open violence that up to the American Civil War known as Bleeding Kansas that took place in the Kansas Territory (Sacking of Lawrence) and the western frontier towns of Missouri throughout the 1850s. The incidents were clashes between pro-slavery factions from both states and anti-slavery Kansans to influence whether Kansas would enter the Union as a free or slave state. In the opening year of the war, six Missouri towns (the largest being Osceola) and large swaths of the western Missouri country side were plundered and burned by guerrilla \"Jayhawkers\" from Kansas. The Sacking of Osceola led to a retaliatory raid on Lawrence, Kansas two years later known as the Lawrence Massacre killing between 185 and 200 men and boys, which in turn led to the infamous General Order No. 11 (1863), the forced depopulation of several western Missouri counties. The raid on Lawrence was led by William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla born in Ohio who had formed his bushwhacker group at the end of 1861. At the time the Civil War broke out, Quantrill was a resident of Lawrence, Kansas teaching school.\n\nThe athletic rivalry began with a football game on October 31, 1891. Currently it is the second longest played series in Division I football and has been described as one of the most intense in the nation. However, no regular season games were scheduled after Missouri accepted an offer to join the Southeastern Conference and Kansas refused Missouri's offer to continue rivalry outside of the conference. In the basketball series Kansas leads by a large margin (172-95 KU), in football Missouri leads by a very small margin (56-55-9 MU) and baseball Missouri leads by a large margin. Regular season games have been scheduled for basketball beginning in 2020 and football in 2025 for the first time since Missouri left for the SEC.\n\nDormant rivalries\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n\nKansas had a rivalry with the Nebraska Cornhuskers, though that rivalry had more to do with who had the better sports program, with Kansas priding itself on its basketball prowess and Nebraska on its football dominance. This rivalry of sports cultures has gone dormant with Nebraska's departure for the Big Ten Conference in 2011. Prior to 2011, the football series between the 2 schools was the 3rd most played rivalry in college football behind Minnesota-Wisconsin and Kansas-Missouri. In basketball, Kansas leads the all-time series 170\u201371.\n\nNotable seasons\n In 1992\u20131993, KU became the second NCAA Division I program to send its football team to a bowl game (Aloha Bowl), one of its basketball teams to the Final Four, and its baseball team to the College World Series in the same academic year. The first was LSU in 1985\u201386. \n In the 2007\u20132008 football and men's basketball seasons, KU amassed a combined 49\u20134 record (12\u20131 football, 37\u20133 basketball), which is the most combined wins ever by an NCAA Division I program, and is also one of only two college sports programs to win a BCS Bowl game and a College Basketball National Championship in the same sports season, the other was the 2006\u20132007 Florida Gators who won the BCS national championship and their second consecutive basketball national championship.\n In the 2011\u20132012 and 2012\u20132013 basketball seasons, KU became the only school in the nation over those two seasons to have their men's and women's basketball teams both qualify for the Sweet 16 both seasons.\n\nNotable athletes\nThis list below is for Olympic medalists and Hall of Famers in their respective sport, with a single exception.

{"text":"Powder coating is a type of coating that is applied as a free-flowing, dry powder. Unlike conventional liquid paint which is delivered via an evaporating solvent, powder coating is typically applied electrostatically and then cured under heat or with ultraviolet light. The powder may be a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. It is usually used to create a hard finish that is tougher than conventional paint. Powder coating is mainly used for coating of metals, such as household appliances, aluminium extrusions, drum hardware, automobiles, and bicycle frames.  Advancements in powder coating technology like UV curable powder coatings allow for other materials such as plastics, composites, carbon fiber, and MDF (medium-density fibreboard) to be powder coated due to the minimum heat and oven dwell time required to process these components.\n\nHistory and general uses\nThe powder coating process was invented around 1945 by Daniel Gustin and received US Patent 2538562 in 1945. This process puts a coating on an item electrostatically, which is then cured by heat. The finish is harder and tougher than conventional paint. The process is useful for coatings on metal used in many household appliances, aluminum products and automotive parts.\n\nProperties of powder coating \nBecause powder coating does not have a liquid carrier, it can produce thicker coatings than  conventional liquid coatings without running or sagging, and powder coating produces minimal appearance differences between horizontally coated surfaces and vertically coated surfaces.  Because no carrier fluid evaporates away, the coating process emits few volatile organic compounds (VOC).  Finally, several powder colors can be applied before curing them all together, allowing color blending and bleed special effects in a single layer.\n\nWhile it is relatively easy to apply thick coatings that cure to smooth, texture-free coating, it is not as easy to apply smooth thin films.  As the film thickness is reduced, the film becomes more and more orange peeled in texture due to the particle size and glass transition temperature (Tg) of the powder.\n\nMost powder coatings have a particle size in the range of 2 to 50\u00a0\u03bcm, a softening temperature Tg around 80\u00a0\u00b0C, a melting temperature around 150\u00a0\u00b0C, and are cured at around 200\u00a0\u00b0C for a minimum of 10 minutes to 15 minutes (exact temperatures and times may depend on the thickness of the item being coated).  For such powder coatings, film build-ups of greater than 50 \u03bcm may be required to obtain an acceptably smooth film. The surface texture which is considered desirable or acceptable depends on the end product.  Many manufacturers prefer to have a certain degree of orange peel since it helps to hide metal defects that have occurred during manufacture, and the resulting coating is less prone to showing fingerprints.\n\nThere are very specialized operations where powder coatings of less than 30\u00a0\u00b5m or with a Tg below 40\u00a0\u00b0C are used in order to produce smooth thin films.  One variation of the dry powder coating process, the Powder Slurry process, combines the advantages of powder coatings and liquid coatings by dispersing very fine powders of 1\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m sized particles into water, which then allows very smooth, low film thickness coatings to be produced.\n\nFor garage-scale jobs, small \"rattle can\" spray paint is less expensive and complex than powder coating.  At the professional scale, the capital expense and time required for a powder coat gun, booth and oven are similar to a spray gun system.  Powder coatings have a major advantage in that the overspray can be recycled.  However, if multiple colors are being sprayed in a single spray booth, this may limit the ability to recycle the overspray.\n\nAdvantages over other coating processes \n Powder coatings contain no solvents and release little or no amount of volatile organic compounds (VOC) into the atmosphere.  Thus, there is no need for finishers to buy costly pollution control equipment. Companies can comply more easily and economically with environmental regulations, such as those issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n Powder coatings can produce much thicker coatings than conventional liquid coatings without running or sagging.\n Powder coated items generally have fewer appearance differences than liquid coated items between horizontally coated surfaces and vertically coated surfaces.\n A wide range of speciality effects are easily accomplished using powder coatings that would be impossible to achieve with other coating processes.\n Curing time is significantly faster with powder coatings compared to liquid coatings especially when using ultraviolet cured powder Coatings or advanced low bake thermosetting powders.\n\nTypes of powder coating\nThere are three main categories of powder coatings: thermosets, thermoplastics, and UV curable powder coatings. Thermoset powder coatings incorporates a cross-linker into the formulation.\n\nMost common cross-linkers are solid epoxy resins in so-called hybrid powders in mixing ratios of 50\/50, 60\/40 and 70\/30 (polyester resin\/ epoxy resin) for indoor applications and triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) in a ratio of 93\/7 and \u03b2-hydroxy alkylamide (HAA) hardener in 95\/5 ratio for outdoor applications. When the powder is baked, it reacts with other chemical groups in the powder to polymerize, improving the performance properties. The chemical cross-linking for hybrids and TGIC powders\u2014representing the major part of the global powder coating market\u2014is based on the reaction of organic acid groups with an epoxy functionality; this carboxy\u2013epoxy reaction is thoroughly investigated and well understood, by addition of catalysts the conversion can be accelerated and curing schedule can be triggered in time and\/or temperature. In the powder coating industry it is common to use catalyst masterbatches where 10\u201315% of the active ingredient is introduced into a polyester carrier resin as matrix. This approach provides the best possible even dispersion of a small amount of a catalyst over the bulk of the powder.\n\nConcerning the cross-linking of the TGIC-free alternative based on HAA hardeners there is no known catalyst available.\n\nFor special applications like coil coatings or clear coats it is common to use glycidylesters as hardener component, their cross-linking is based on the carboxy\u2013epoxy chemistry too. A different chemical reaction is used in so-called polyurethane powders, where the binder resin carries hydroxyl functional groups that react with isocyanate groups of the hardener component. The isocyanate group is usually introduced into the powder in blocked form where the isocyanate functionality is pre-reacted with \u03b5-caprolactame as blocking agent or in form of uretdiones, at elevated temperatures (deblocking temperature) the free isocyanate groups are released and available for the cross-linking reaction with hydroxyl functionality.\n\nIn general all thermosetting powder formulations contain next to the binder resin and cross-linker additives to support flow out and levelling and for degassing. Common is the use of flow promoter where the active ingredient\u2014a polyacrylate\u2014is absorbed on silica as carrier or as masterbatch dispersed in a polyester resin as matrix. Vast majority of powders contain benzoin as degassing agent to avoid pinholes in final powder coating film.\n\nThe thermoplastic variety does not undergo any additional actions during the baking process as it flows to form the final coating. UV-curable powder coatings are photopolymerisable materials containing a chemical photoinitiator that instantly responds to UV light energy by initiating the reaction that leads to crosslinking or cure. The differentiating factor of this process from others is the separation of the melt stage before the cure stage. UV-cured powder will melt in 60 to 120 seconds when reaching a temperature 110\u00a0\u00b0C and 130\u00a0\u00b0C. Once the melted coating is in this temperature window, it is instantly cured when exposed to UV light.\n\nThe most common polymers used are: polyester, polyurethane, polyester-epoxy (known as hybrid), straight epoxy (fusion bonded epoxy) and acrylics.\n\nProduction\n The polymer granules are mixed with hardener, pigments and other powder ingredients in an industrial mixer, such as a turbomixer\n The mixture is heated in an extruder\n The extruded mixture is rolled flat, cooled and broken into small chips\n The chips are milled and sieved to make a fine powder\n\nMethodology \nThe powder coating process involves three basic steps: part preparation or the pre-treatment, the powder application, and curing.\n\nPart preparation processes and equipment\nRemoval of oil, dirt, lubrication greases, metal oxides, welding scale etc. is essential prior to the powder coating process. It can be done by a variety of chemical and mechanical methods. The selection of the method depends on the size and the material of the part to be powder coated, the type of impurities to be removed and the performance requirement of the finished product. Some heat-sensitive plastics and composites have low surface tensions and plasma treating can be necessary to improve powder adhesion.\n\nChemical pre-treatments involve the use of phosphates or chromates in submersion or spray application. These often occur in multiple stages and consist of degreasing, etching, de-smutting, various rinses and the final phosphating or chromating of the substrate and new nanotechnology chemical bonding. The pre-treatment process both cleans and improves bonding of the powder to the metal. Recent additional processes have been developed that avoid the use of chromates, as these can be toxic to the environment. Titanium, zirconium and silanes offer similar performance against corrosion and adhesion of the powder.\n\nIn many high end applications, the part is electrocoated following the pretreatment process, and subsequent to the powder coating application.  This has been particularly useful in automotive and other applications requiring high end performance characteristics.\n\nAnother method of preparing the surface prior to coating is known as abrasive blasting or sandblasting and shot blasting. Blast media and blasting abrasives are used to provide surface texturing and preparation, etching, finishing, and degreasing for products made of wood, plastic, or glass. The most important properties to consider are chemical composition and density; particle shape and size; and impact resistance.\n\nSilicon carbide grit blast medium is brittle, sharp, and suitable for grinding metals and low-tensile strength, non-metallic materials. Plastic media blast equipment uses plastic abrasives that are sensitive to substrates such as aluminum, but still suitable for de-coating and surface finishing. Sand blast medium uses high-purity crystals that have low-metal content. Glass bead blast medium contains glass beads of various sizes.\n\nCast steel shot or steel grit is used to clean and prepare the surface before coating. Shot blasting recycles the media and is environmentally friendly. This method of preparation is highly efficient on steel parts such as I-beams, angles, pipes, tubes and large fabricated pieces.\n\nDifferent powder coating applications can require alternative methods of preparation such as abrasive blasting prior to coating. The online consumer market typically offers media blasting services coupled with their coating services at additional costs.\n\nA recent development for the powder coating industry is the use of plasma pretreatment for heat-sensitive plastics and composites. These materials typically have low-energy surfaces, are hydrophobic, and have a low degree of wetability which all negatively impact coating adhesion. Plasma treatment physically cleans, etches, and provides chemically active bonding sites for coatings to anchor to. The result is a hydrophilic, wettable surface that is amenable to coating flow and adhesion.\n\nPowder application processes\n\nThe most common way of applying the powder coating to metal objects is to spray the powder using an electrostatic gun, or corona gun. The gun imparts a negative charge to the powder, which is then sprayed towards the grounded object by mechanical or compressed air spraying and then accelerated toward the workpiece by the powerful electrostatic charge.  There is a wide variety of spray nozzles available for use in electrostatic coating. The type of nozzle used will depend on the shape of the workpiece to be painted and the consistency of the paint. The object is then heated, and the powder melts into a uniform film, and is then cooled to form a hard coating. It is also common to heat the metal first and then spray the powder onto the hot substrate. Preheating can help to achieve a more uniform finish but can also create other problems, such as runs caused by excess powder.\n\nAnother type of gun is called a tribo gun, which charges the powder by (triboelectric) friction. In this case, the powder picks up a positive charge while rubbing along the wall of a Teflon tube inside the barrel of the gun. These charged powder particles then adhere to the grounded substrate. Using a tribo gun requires a different formulation of powder than the more common corona guns. Tribo guns are not subject to some of the problems associated with corona guns, however, such as back-ionization and the Faraday cage effect.\n\nPowder can also be applied using specifically adapted electrostatic discs.\n\nAnother method of applying powder coating, named as the fluidized bed method, is by heating the substrate and then dipping it into an aerated, powder-filled bed. The powder sticks and melts to the hot object. Further heating is usually required to finish curing the coating. This method is generally used when the desired thickness of coating is to exceed 300 micrometres. This is how most dishwasher racks are coated.\n\nElectrostatic fluidized bed coating\nElectrostatic fluidized bed application uses the same fluidizing technique as the conventional fluidized bed dip process but with much more powder depth in the bed. An electrostatic charging medium is placed inside the bed so that the powder material becomes charged as the fluidizing air lifts it up. Charged particles of powder move upward and form a cloud of charged powder above the fluid bed. When a grounded part is passed through the charged cloud the particles will be attracted to its surface. The parts are not preheated as they are for the conventional fluidized bed dip process.\n\nElectrostatic magnetic brush (EMB) coating\nA coating method for flat materials that applies powder with a roller, enabling relatively high speeds and accurate layer thickness between 5 and 100 micrometres. The base for this process is conventional copier technology. It is currently in use in some coating applications and looks promising for commercial powder coating on flat substrates (steel, aluminium, MDF, paper, board) as well as in sheet to sheet and\/or roll to roll processes. This process can potentially be integrated in an existing coating line.\n\nCuring\n\nThermoset \nWhen a thermosetting powder is exposed to elevated temperature, it begins to melt, flows out, and then chemically reacts to form a higher molecular weight polymer in a network-like structure. This cure process, called crosslinking, requires a certain temperature for a certain length of time in order to reach full cure and establish the full film properties for which the material was designed.\n\nThe architecture of the polyester resin and type of curing agent have a major impact on crosslinking.\n\nCommon powders cure at 200\u00a0\u00b0C (390\u00a0\u00b0F) object temperature for 10 minutes. In European and Asian markets, a curing schedule of 180\u00a0\u00b0C (356\u00a0\u00b0F) for 10 minutes has been the industrial standard for decades, but is nowadays shifting towards a temperature level of 160\u00a0\u00b0C (320\u00a0\u00b0F) at the same curing time. Advanced hybrid systems for indoor applications are established to cure at a temperature level of 125\u2013130\u00a0\u00b0C (257\u2013266\u00a0\u00b0F) preferably for applications on medium density fiberboards (MDF); outdoor durable powders with triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) as hardener can operate at a similar temperature level, whereas TGIC-free systems with \u03b2-hydroxy alkylamides as curing agents are limited to approx. 160\u00a0\u00b0C (320\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\nThe low bake approach results in energy savings especially in cases where coating of massive parts are task of the coating operation. The total oven residence time needs to be only 18\u201319 min to completely cure the reactive powder at 180\u00a0\u00b0C (356\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\nA major challenge for all low bake systems is to optimize simultaneously reactivity, flow out (aspect of the powder film) and storage stability. Low temperature cure powders tend to have less color stability than their standard bake counterparts because they contain catalysts to augment accelerated cure. HAA polyesters tend to overbake yellow more so than TGIC polyesters.\n\nThe curing schedule could vary according to the manufacturer's specifications. The application of energy to the product to be cured can be accomplished by convection cure ovens, infrared cure ovens, or by laser curing process. The latter demonstrates significant reduction of curing time.\n\nUV cure \nUltraviolet (UV)-cured powder coatings have been in commercial use since the 1990s and were initially developed to finish heat-sensitive medium density fiberboard (MDF) furniture components. This coating technology requires less heat energy and cures significantly faster than thermally-cured powder coatings. Typical oven dwell times for UV curable powder coatings are 1\u20132 minutes with temperatures of the coating reaching 110\u2013130\u00a0\u00b0C. The use of UV LED curing systems, which are highly energy efficient and do not generate IR energy from the lamp head, make UV-cured powder coating even more desirable for finishing a variety of heat-sensitive materials and assemblies. An additional benefit for UV-cured powder coatings is that the total process cycle, application to cure, is faster than other coating methods.\n\nRemoving powder coating \nMethylene chloride and acetone are generally effective at removing powder coating. Most other organic solvents (thinners, etc.) are completely ineffective. Recently, the suspected human carcinogen methylene chloride is being replaced by benzyl alcohol with great success. Powder coating can also be removed with abrasive blasting. 98% sulfuric acid commercial grade also removes powder coating film.  Certain low grade powder coats can be removed with steel wool, though this might be a more labor-intensive process than desired.\n\nPowder coating can also be removed by a burning off process, in which parts are put into a large high-temperature oven with temperatures typically reaching an air temperature of 300\u2013450\u00a0\u00b0C. The process takes about four hours and requires the parts to be cleaned completely and re-powder coated. Parts made with a thinner-gauge material need to be burned off at a lower temperature to prevent the material from warping.\n\nMarket\nAccording to a market report prepared in August 2016 by Grand View Research, Inc., the powder coating industry includes Teflon, anodizing and electro-plating. The global powder coatings market is expected to reach USD 16.55\u00a0billion by 2024. Increasing use of powder coatings for aluminum extrusion used in windows, door frames, building facades, kitchen, bathroom and electrical fixtures will fuel industry expansion. Rising construction spending in various countries including China, the U.S., Mexico, Qatar, UAE, India, Vietnam, and Singapore will fuel growth over the forecast period. Increasing government support for eco-friendly and economical products will stimulate demand over the forecast period. General industries were the prominent application segment and accounted for 20.7% of the global volume in 2015. The global market is predicted to be 20\u00a0billion dollars by 2027.\n\nIncreasing demand for tractors in the U.S., Brazil, Japan, India, and China is expected to augment the use of powder coatings on account of its corrosion protection, excellent outdoor durability, and high-temperature performance. Moreover, growing usage in agricultural equipment, exercise equipment, file drawers, computer cabinets, laptop computers, cell phones, and electronic components will propel industry expansion.\n\nSee also \n Laser printer\n Fusion bonded epoxy coating\n Powder coating on glass\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nBuilding\nPainting materials\nMotorcycle technology\nSurface finishing\nCoating","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135447}
{"text":"A custodian bank, or simply custodian, is a specialized financial institution responsible for providing securities services. It safeguards assets of asset managers, insurance companies, hedge funds, and is not engaged in \"traditional\" commercial or consumer\/retail banking like lending. The role of a custodian in such a case would be to:\n\n hold in safekeeping assets\/securities such as stocks, bonds, commodities such as precious metals and currency (cash), domestic and foreign\n arrange settlement of any purchases and sales and deliveries in\/out of such securities and currency\n collect information on and income from such assets (dividends in the case of stocks\/equities and coupons (interest payments) in the case of bonds) and administer related tax withholding documents and foreign tax reclamation\n administer voluntary and involuntary corporate actions on securities held such as stock dividends, stock splits, business combinations (mergers), tender offers, bond calls, etc.\n provide information on the securities and their issuers such as annual general meetings and related proxies\n maintain currency\/cash bank accounts, effect deposits and withdrawals and manage other cash transactions\n perform foreign exchange transactions\n often perform additional services for particular clients such as mutual funds; examples include fund accounting, administration, legal, compliance and tax support services\n\nUsing US definitions, a person who owns street name securities and who is not a member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.\nGlobal securities safekeeping practices vary substantially with markets such as the UK, Australia and South Africa encouraging designated securities accounts in order to permit shareholder identification by companies.\n\nThe definition of \"shareholder\" is generally upheld by corporate law rather than securities law. One role of custodians (which may or may not be enforced by securities regulation) is to facilitate the exercise of share ownership rights, for example and processing dividends and other payments, corporate actions, the proceeds of a stock split or a reverse stock split, the ability to vote in the company's annual general meeting (AGM), information and reports sent from the company and so forth. The extent to which such services are offered are a function of the client agreement together with relevant market rules, regulations and laws.\n\nCustodian banks are often referred to as global custodians if they safe keep assets for their clients in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks (\"sub-custodian\" or \"agent banks\") with which they contract to be in their \"global network\" in each market to hold accounts for their respective clients. Assets held in such a manner are typically owned by larger institutional firms with a considerable number of investments such as banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds and pension funds.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nIn 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy established a Committee on Corporate Pension Plans. 2 years later, Studebaker Auto Manufacturer, shuttered its business and operations, and it failed to provide pensions to the affected approximately 7,000 employees. Hence, in 1974, U.S. President Gerald Ford proposed an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA Act), protecting the employee benefit plans' standards.\n\nSince the Act has become effective, employers could not hold and keep their pension fund assets. Instead, they are obligated to appoint external custodians to safekeep the assets. Also, they are required to appoint trustees and depositories to ensure the pension funds are operated in the best interest of the pension holders and aligned to the investment mandates.\n\nFurther Developments\nAnd now, more banks have developed a wealth range of custody and related services (securities services), and have been keen on developing new technologies (e.g. blockchain, API, distributed ledger) and aligning with the fast-moving regulatory requirement, such as digital assets.\n\nClient Segments & Products\nThe securities services industry mainly serves two types of clients: 1) Asset Owners & Managers and 2) Banks, Brokers & Dealers.\n\nAsset Owners & Managers\nFor the client segment of Asset Owners & Managers, it includes asset management companies, alternative asset managers, insurance companies, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, family offices and prime brokers.\n\nThe bank may offer products & services below:\nGlobal Custody\nFund Administration: Fund accounting and valuation services across different fund types and structures by using the bank's integrated fund accounting platform. For example, offering Net asset value (NAV) and portfolio holding etc. reports and financial reporting support. Usually, ETF services also fall under the scope of fund admin.\nTransfer Agency\nCollateral Management & Segregation: Collateral management is the management of collateral. Banks can optimize financial institutions\u2019 collateral portfolios with internal analysis tools and flexible two-way\/three-way solutions. A number of global banks can make better use of their global capabilities to help FI manage one-stop global or onshore collateral, and meet complex financing and liquidity needs.\nMiddle Office Outsourcing\nSecurities Lending & Borrowing\nTreasury Products (Cash Management & FX)\nTrustee Services\n\nBanks, Brokers & Dealers\nThe client segment of Banks, Brokers & Dealers includes global custodians, banks, brokers and dealers.\n\nThe bank may offer products & services below:\nDirect Custody & Clearing\nThird Party Clearing\nAccount Operators\n\nGlobal Custody & Direct Custody\n\nGlobal Custody\nA global custodian is responsible for the safekeeping and administration of assets of clients, for instance, asset managers & owners, in multiple markets. They serve as the first point of contact for their global clients. However, they may not have such a strong network in every jurisdictions in which the clients want to invest. Therefore, the global custodian needs to appoint and manage direct custodians which have existing securities services infrastructure in some individual markets.\n\nDirect Custody\nA Direct custodian offers custody services in their local markets. Global custodians are their focused clients as direct custodians can offer knowledge and experience of the markets and industry and, close relationships with the local regulators in the local market, which the global custodian might lack but require. Therefore, it is responsible for the safekeeping and administration of assets of clients, for instance, asset managers & owners, in a local market.\n\nIndustry Profile\n\nIndustry Size\nAs of 2022, the market size (as measured by revenue) of the Custody, Asset & Securities Services industry in the US is $32.5bn, with a YoY 2.9% growth between 2017 and 2022.\n\nIndustry Players\nPlenty of investment banks and banks offer securities services. Generally, the division of securities services is either grouped with Global Markets to form a larger umbrella of Markets & Securities Services (MSS) or falls under the umbrella of Corporate Banking or Transaction Banking.\n\nFor instance, Citi and HSBC restructured and combined their Global Markets and Securities Services divisions in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\nPlayers include but not limited to (according to alphabetical order):\n\n BNP Paribas: Securities Services\n BNY Mellon: Securities Services\n Citi: Markets & Securities Services\n Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\/Santander: CACEIS Investor Services\n Deutsche Bank: Corporate Banking\n HSBC: Markets & Securities Services\n J.P.

The trustee\/custodian provides custody of the assets, processes all transactions, maintains other records pertaining to them, files the required IRS reports, issues client statements, helps clients understand the rules and regulations pertaining to certain prohibited transactions, and performs other administrative duties on behalf of the self-directed retirement account owner.\n\nSelf-directed retirement account custodians (also known as \"self-directed IRA custodians\" or \"self-directed 401k custodians\") should not be confused with a custodian bank, which strictly provides safekeeping for securities. While a self-directed retirement account custodian can provide custody for securities, typically it will specialize in non-security assets, or alternative investments. Examples of alternative investments would be: Real Estate, precious metals, private mortgages, private company stock, oil and gas LPs, horses, and intellectual property. These types of assets require a specialization on the part of the custodian due to the complexity of the documentation required to keep the alternative investments in compliance with the IRC.\n\nMutual Fund Custodian\nA Mutual Fund Custodian refers typically to a custodian bank or trust company (a special type of financial institution regulated like a \"bank\"), or similar financial institution responsible for holding and safeguarding the securities owned by a mutual fund. A mutual fund's custodian may also act as one or more service agents for the mutual fund such as being the fund accountant, administrator and\/or transfer agent which maintains shareholder records and disburses periodic dividends or capital gains, if any, distributed by the fund. The vast majority of funds use a third party custodian as required by SEC regulation to avoid complex rules and requirements about self-custody.\n\nA mutual fund retirement account (IRA, SEP etc.) custodian, however, refers to the plan administrator and recordkeeper such as noted above, which may not necessarily be the same institution providing custody services to the investments of the overall fund.\n\nSee also\nCentral securities depository\nEscrow\nCustodial account\nSecurities market participants (United States)\n\nReferences\n\nBanking\nCorporate law","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135448}
{"text":"Father John Huddleston  (15 April 1608 \u2013 buried 13 September 1698) was an English Roman Catholic priest, and a monk of the Order of St. Benedict who helped Charles II during his escape and was present when Charles converted to the Catholic faith on his deathbed.\n\nEarly life and education \nJohn Huddleston was born at Farington Hall, Lancashire, the second son of Joseph Huddleston from Hutton John, near Penrith in Cumberland. His uncle, Richard Huddleston, was a Benedictine priest. John was educated at the school at nearby Great Blencow until he was fifteen.  When he was twenty he was sent to St Omer College, and on 17 October 1632, entered the English College in Rome. On 22 March 1637, Huddleston was ordained priest in St. John Lateran's, and left Rome for England on 28 March 1639.\n\nChaplain to Thomas Whitgreave \nIn 1651 he was staying at Moseley Old Hall, Staffordshire, as chaplain to Thomas Whitgreave's family, prominent local Catholics. After the defeat at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, Charles II was conducted by Colonel Gifford to Whiteladies Priory on Gifford's Boscobel estate.  At Whiteladies, the King was sheltered by the five Penderell brothers who lived there.  John Penderell happened to meet Father Huddleston, who suggested that the King should go to Moseley Old Hall on the night of 7 September. Huddleston cleaned and bandaged the King's sore feet. To guard against surprise Huddleston was constantly in attendance on the king; his three pupils were stationed as sentinels at upper windows and Thomas Whitgreave patrolled the garden.\n\nOn 9 September, Parliamentary troops questioned Whitgreave, while the King and Huddleston were hiding in the priest-hole.  The troops were persuaded that Whitgreave had not fought at Worcester (though he had fought and been captured at the Battle of Naseby in 1645).  The troops left without searching the house.\n\nBenedictines of the Spanish Congregation \nBefore the King left to meet Jane Lane at Bentley Hall, he promised to look after Huddleston when restored to his throne. Some time afterward, Huddleston joined the Benedictines of the Spanish Congregation. After the Restoration in 1660, Huddleston was invited to live at Somerset House, London, under the protection of Queen Henrietta Maria. After her death in 1669, he was appointed chaplain to Queen Catherine, with a salary of \u00a3100 a year.  During the disturbances produced by Titus Oates's pretended revelations, the House of Lords voted on 7 December 1678 that Huddleston, Thomas Whitgreave, the brothers Penderell, and others involved in Charles II's escape should \"for their said service live as freely as any of the King's Protestant subjects, without being liable to the penalties of any of the laws relating to Popish recusants\".\n\nWhen Charles II lay dying on the evening of 5 February 1685, his brother and heir the Duke of York brought Huddleston to his bedside, saying, \"Sire, this good man once saved your life. He now comes to save your soul.\" Charles declared that he wished to die in the faith and communion of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. Huddleston then heard the King's confession, reconciled him to the Church and absolved him, afterwards administering Extreme Unction and the Viaticum. On the accession of James II, Huddleston continued to stay with the Queen Catherine at Somerset House.\n\nIllness and death \nShortly before his death aged 90 his mind failed and he was placed in the charge of a trustee. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary-le-Strand.\n\nSeveral portraits of Huddleston exist: Houseman's done in 1685 is at Hutton John; another is at Sawston Hall, Cambridgeshire.\n\nReferences\n\n More detail and a portrait\n\n1608 births\n1698 deaths\nPeople of the English Civil War\nEnglish Benedictines\n17th-century English Roman Catholic priests","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135449}
{"text":"Equity value is the value of a company available to owners or shareholders. It is the enterprise value plus all cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, and less all short-term debt, long-term debt and minority interests.\n\nEquity value accounts for all the ownership interest in a firm including the value of unexercised stock options and securities convertible to equity.\n\nFrom a mergers and acquisitions to  an academic perspective, equity value differs from market capitalization or market value in that it incorporates all equity interests in a firm whereas market capitalization or market value only reflects those common shares currently outstanding.\n\nCalculating Equity Value\nEquity value can be calculated in two ways, either the intrinsic value method, or the fair market value method. The intrinsic value method is calculated as follows:\n\n Equity Value = \n Market capitalization \n + Amount that in-the-money stock options are in the money\n + Value of equity issued from in-the-money convertible securities \n - Proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities\n\nThe fair market value method is as follows:\n\n Equity Value = \n Market capitalization \n + fair value of all stock options (in the money and out of the money), calculated using the Black\u2013Scholes formula or a similar method\n + Value of convertible securities in excess of what the same securities would be valued without the conversion attribute\n\nThe fair market value method more accurately captures the value of out of the money securities.\n\nReferences\n\nMathematical finance\nFundamental analysis","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":135450}
{"text":" The United States' rationale for opening relations and allowing US companies to do business in Communist China but not in Communist Russia, Cuba, or North Korea was based on the idea that engagement with China would encourage economic and political reform, and that trade with China would be beneficial to both countries.\n\nThe United States' interest in engaging with China was driven by a number of factors, including China's growing economy and the potential for trade and investment, as well as the belief that engagement with China could help to encourage political reform and the transition to a more democratic system.\n\nIn contrast, the United States has had much less interest in engaging with Russia, Cuba, and North Korea, due in part to the perceived lack of potential for economic and political reform in these countries, as well as concerns about the stability and security of the region.\n\nThe United States has also been concerned about the potential for trade with these countries to support their authoritarian regimes and to facilitate the spread of communism. In the case of Cuba, the United States has also been concerned about the potential for trade to support the Cuban government's human rights abuses.\n\nOverall, the United States' rationale for opening relations and allowing US companies to do business in Communist China but not in Communist Russia, Cuba, or North Korea has been based on the idea that engagement with China could be beneficial, while engagement with Russia, Cuba, and North Korea could be harmful.","label":1,"model":"cohere","source":"reddit","id":171838}
