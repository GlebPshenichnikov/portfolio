{"text":"Yes, lightning does strike the ocean, and it can cause a number of adverse effects. While water is an excellent conductor of electricity, the extent of its effectiveness as a conduit for electricity generated from lightning depends on the particulars of the situation. Although fish can be electrocuted by lightning, it is not a commonly observed effect.\n\nLightning can cause what is known as \u201cside flash\u201d or \u201csplash-over.\u201d This is when the initial electrical current produced by a lightning strike is so high that it causes large eddies in the water surrounding the strike, which disperse outwardly in a concentric fashion and increases the conductivity of the water. This increase in conductivity then causes the lightning to spread its electrical charge into the ocean.\n\nThis side flash can be dangerous to any marine life in the vicinity of the strike, as the electrical current produced by lightning is very powerful and can cause paralysis, drownings, and even electrocutions. However, because of the large size of the ocean and the unpredictability of lightning it is very difficult to accurately predict which marine life might be affected, so electrocuting fish is not considered a common effect of lightning striking the ocean.\n\nThough fish appear to be relatively safe from the direct effects of lightning, what is often far more devastating is the concussion, or shock wave, which is created when a lightning bolt enters the water. This shock wave can travel quite far, causing damage and death to fish and other marine life, even if the strike was relatively far away.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that lightning can strike and affect the ocean, though it is not strictly an electrocution hazard for fish. The powerful electrical charge and shock wave produced by a lightning strike can cause serious harm, but it is usually not in the form of electrocution.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18165}
{"text":"In a nutshell, no, we cannot accurately calculate when someone will die of old age based on the telomere length. This is mainly because while telomere shortening is required in order for a cell to divide, there are numerous other factors that can contribute to aging and eventual death.\n\nIn general, telomere shortening is a biological phenomenon that is associated with cellular aging and predicted to decrease the lifespan of the organism. Telomeres are a \u201cprotective cap\u201d found at the ends of chromosomes, and they typically shorten with each new cell division. Shorter telomeres have been linked to age-related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as mortality. Consequently, telomere length has been studied as a marker of aging and lifespan potential.\n\nIn addition to telomere length, there are numerous other factors that are also thought to contribute to aging. Among these are free radical damage, inefficient metabolic reactions, epigenetic factors, and genetic factors. All of these can lead to cell damage and senescence, and can impact how quickly the telomeres become shortened. \n\nThe idea of telomeres being used to predict mortality has been widely debated. While some research has suggested that telomeres are a reliable biomarker of lifespan, it is important to note that there are a variety of other complex factors that can impact mortality and telomeres are only one piece of the puzzle. \n\nAging is a multifaceted process, and the length of telomeres alone cannot accurately predict when someone will die of old age. Although telomere length is an important factor to consider, it is only one of several contributing factors that can lead to age-related diseases and mortality. Therefore, it would be unwise to rely solely on telomere length to predict when someone will die.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18166}
{"text":"Yes, if ocean water had a higher viscosity, it would affect the size of waves. Ocean waves are a result of wind energy pushing against the water\u2019s surface. As the wind blows across the surface, it transfer energy to the water particles, leading to particle displacement that causes the wave. The size of the wave is dependent on the wind speed and the duration of the wind. The higher the viscosity of the ocean water, the greater the friction between water molecules and the slower the speed of the wave. Since the wave transmits energy from the wind, this could lead to smaller waves than what would normally be expected with a lower-viscous ocean. \n\nIn addition, the thicker viscosity of the water could affect surface tension. Surface tension is the surface layer of the water that has a different level of water molecules due to their interaction with each other \u2013 creating what can be considered a \"skin\" over the surface. As the ocean water viscosity increases, surface tension rises, which can cause the wave size to be reduced by inducing higher creep rates between the surface and the wave peak. \n\nFurthermore, because of the increased viscosity of the ocean, the wind pressure required to break the surface tension and create a wave increases, with higher viscosity waves needing more intense winds to push against the surface. This could lead to the formation of smaller waves due to the difficulty of achieving the necessary wind speeds to create waves with a higher viscosity ocean. \n\nTherefore, if ocean water had a higher viscosity, it would likely lead to smaller overall wave size. Since wave energy is partially determined by ocean viscosity, a change in viscosity could lead to alterations in wave size and energy transfer from the wind.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18167}
{"text":"If I were traveling at near the speed of light, I would indeed be able to think normally. According to Albert Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity, you would experience time differently depending on your speed relative to the speed of light. Basically, time slows down the closer you get to light speed. However, there is some debate as to whether or not time would slow to the point of being able to be perceived. \n\nSome theories suggest that time would slow to the point that a person\u2019s thoughts would become distorted and they would be unable to think, while others suggest that time would only slow to the point that it would be noticed but not interfere with one\u2019s mental processes. While many believe that it could be possible at some point in the future to travel close to the speed of light, as of now, this feat has not been accomplished yet. \n\nTherefore, it is impossible to know for sure how someone traveling near the speed of light would experience time. While it is likely that time would slow and be noticeable to the person traveling, it is impossible to say how much slower it would be. It is scientifically impossible to be able to travel faster than the speed of light, so it is also impossible to measure how a person would experience time while traveling at that speed. \n\nIt is possible, however, to simulate the experience of travelling at near the speed of light and experience \u201ctime dilation\u201d, or time slowing down as one gets closer to the speed of light. IMAGEUS, a research project of the European Centre of Research and Industry, used virtual reality to simulate a near light speed experience and found that the participant did experience a slowing of time, though the effects were not as drastic as one might expect. \n\nOverall, while we don\u2019t have a definitive answer as to how time would slow down for someone travelling at near the speed of light, it is possible that time would slow down to a noticeable point, yet not be so greatly slowed as to interfere with normal cognitive functions.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18168}
{"text":"Wow! That's a really cool idea. To make an explosion out of the energy we get from eating in one day! Well, I'm not sure I could tell you exactly how big the explosion would be, but I can tell you what would happen. \n\nWhen we eat, we digest the food, and turn it into energy. This energy gives us energy to do things like running and playing, but at the same time, it releases heat. All this heat energy is converted into tiny micro-explosions that help us digest the food. \n\nSo if we were to take ALL this energy and release it in one go, it would be like a mini-explosion. It wouldn't be as big as a real explosion, like the ones you see in movies with fire and burning buildings, but it still would be enough to create a bit of a shock wave. I'm guessing it wouldn't be enough to cause much damage, but if you were standing too close it might make you feel a bit weird. \n\nThe size of the explosion would depend on the food we eat, because different foods have different amounts of energy. The more energy-dense food we eat, the bigger the explosion. So if you ate a lot of candy and desserts, the explosion would probably be much bigger than if you ate a lot of vegetables. \n\nSo I'm not sure exactly how big a mini explosion would be if you took all the energy from eating in a day and released it in one go, but I'm guessing it's enough to make a bit of a spark and a bit of noise. \n\nThat's really cool though, and I'm sure it would be fun to see it happen.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18169}
{"text":"The answer to this question is both yes and no. It is possible to find the algorithm for a random number generator provided that there is sufficient data and a strong mathematical background to analyze the data. There are many existing mathematical techniques that can be used to analyze any generated sequence of numbers and possibly reverse-engineer an algorithm, given the right conditions.\n\nFor example, one method would be to establish an initial data set of sequences and use information theory techniques to outline the distribution of the observed randomness. This type of analysis can help to identify any patterns in the observed randomness and determine if any of these patterns can be used to create a reliable algorithm for generating random numbers. Furthermore, this method can be performed with a minimal data set and requires no previous knowledge of the underlying algorithm.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also possible to study the sequences produced by a random number generator and not be able to produce a reliable algorithm. It is likely that very complex random number generators may generate sequences that appear random in the short run, yet deviate significantly, as the sequence length grows. In this case, it may be impossible, with existing technology, to reverse-engineer an algorithm that could replicate the same randomness.\n\nIn conclusion, if the observed sequences of numbers are simple enough, it is possible to study these sequences and develop reliable algorithms that can replicate the same sequences. However, if the sequences are complex, it is not always possible to produce reliable algorithms that generate identical sequences as the original random number generator due to the limitations of technology.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18170}
{"text":"Marsquakes are seismic waves generated when seismic energy is released due to a sudden rupture of rocks on or near the Martian surface. These seismic waves can range from repetitively small vibrations to large ones. On April 6, 2019, NASA's InSight lander for the first time recorded a seismic event on Mars, called a marsquake.\n\nSo what are the causes of Marsquakes?\n\nThe primary cause of Marsquakes is likely due to the disruption of brittle rocks as a consequence of the planet's cooling and contraction. As Mars cools, it contracts and in the process, rocks become brittle and break, resulting in the release of energy that causes Marsquakes. The amount and intensity of Marsquakes can vary depending on the frequency and amount of contraction.\n\nOther possible causes of Marsquakes are meteorite impacts, large landslides, and changes in the planet\u2019s magnetic field. All of these can cause sudden and powerful seismic waves.\n\nDoes Mars have tectonic plates like Earth?\n\nNo, Mars does not have tectonic plates like Earth, but instead has a lack of large-scale tectonic activity, and is generally characterized by low levels of seismic activity or none at all. Therefore, any seismic activity that is observed is likely related to non-tectonic triggers such as meteorite impacts and thermal contraction.\n\nSo, while the primary cause of Marsquake is likely due to the cooling and contraction process, other triggers such as meteorite impacts, large landslides and changes in the planet\u2019s magnetic field are also thought to be potential contributors. Additionally, the lack of tectonic activity on Mars explains why Marsquakes are less frequent and intense than earthquakes on Earth.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18171}
{"text":"The concept of empty space, nothingness, and the nature of their relationship has been one of the core debates within philosophy for centuries. It is a difficult topic to discuss, however, as their definitions vary widely among proponents and depend on what is being discussed. At the most fundamental level, the terms nothingness and empty space can be used interchangeably to refer to a complete vacuum, or the lack of anything, both material or immaterial.\n\nNon-material emptiness can refer to ideality, or the concept that everything that can be thought of is abstract and lacks physicality or presence. On the other hand, material emptiness (or nothing) refers to the absence of matter or energy and the total absence of mass or objects. Emptiness then becomes a spectrum ranging from nothingness (the lack of all things) to the absence of something.\n\nAlthough the lack of anything is empty, the two terms do not necessarily equate. Nothingness is an absence of something, while empty space has room for something to exist, however, nothing currently resides there. While it is currently empty, that does not mean something cannot fill it in the future. Nothingness, however, is a complete void and is unable to be filled.\n\nThe notion of nothingness is a fascinating concept, as it has its own implications for what can and cannot exist. In physics, it is believed that there are laws that govern empty space, such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in which the energy and momentum of particles in empty space can never be precisely known. This suggests that empty space is not simply a void, but instead has a certain amount of energy known as vacuum energy or dark energy.\n\nTherefore, while an absence of something can be considered empty, nothingness and empty space are not the same thing. Nothingness, or the lack of all things, is not able to contain or be altered by anything, while empty space can. This distinction is an important one, as it has implications and applications to areas such as physics and physical cosmology.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18172}
{"text":"Some people have an innate sense of direction while others often find themselves quite lost. This phenomenon can be attributed to differentials in the brain's structure. Referred to as \"wayfinding,\" the ability to sense and find one's orientation arises from a combination of our memories, visual analysis of our environment and subtle cues from the body.\n\nWhen it comes to those who possess a good sense of direction, many of them seem to have higher than average spatial memory. According to several research studies, their brains store and rapidly organize spatial information about the environment. This allows them to remember how to reach a certain place in the future. They are also likely to possess better visual analysis skills, enabling them to see two or three steps ahead and identify possible ambush points or dead-ends.\n\nThe orientation aspect of wayfinding relies heavily on cues from the body. For example; people with a good sense of direction are often more attuned to their left and right, especially in novel environments because the brain has to deal with a lack of familiarity. When this happens, the right hemisphere kicks-in and helps the person orient their sense of direction.\n\nThe underlying neurology that allows people to have a good sense of direction is based mainly on their preferential communication between the right and left parts of the brain. People who have a good sense of direction tend to have more efficient neural pathways between these two hemispheres, allowing more accurate processing in both real and imagined environments.\n\nThe sense of direction we have is a combination of many complex processes, but it has been proven that those who possess it naturally do so from a structural viewpoint. Differentiated brain structure and communication between the two hemispheres are likely to be the root of this superior ability.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18173}

The first and one of the most important is because sperm are recognized by the body as its own cells; as such, the immune system doesn\u2019t attack its own cells. \n\nNext, sperm carries a layer of molecules called immunosuppressive molecules on its surface, which helps prevent the body\u2019s immune system from attacking it. These molecules, or suppressors, help to keep inflammation at bay and give sperm a \u201cpass\u201d when they are passing through the body. \n\nThe body\u2019s semen also contains immunoglobulins, which are proteins that help protect sperm from attack by the immune system. These immunoglobulins bind to the immune suppressors and also keep the immune system at bay. This helps the sperm to travel successfully to its destination.\n\nFinally, there are certain immune factors that are released from the female\u2019s body when sperm enters, which helps suppress the activity of the immune system. This helps to ensure that the sperm is able to move effectively without being attacked. \n\nAll of these elements help sperm to successfully reach its destination without triggering an attack from the immune system, and help ensure successful reproductive success. Therefore the lack of attack from the immune system allows sperm to reach its destination, thus leading to the achievement of reproductive success.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18174}

The truth is that in a potentially serious accident nothing can prepare you - no matter what kind of seat you\u2019re in. \n\nHowever, understanding how a forward-facing and a rear-facing seat could potentially protect you in a crash may be useful in order to make the best decision possible. \n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s consider the differences between the two. With a forward-facing seat, you would likely be facing the direction in which the train is moving - towards the other cars and the engine. During an accident, any kind of body collision with the parts in front of you can\u2019t be avoided - but your seat could provide a measure of protection. Many seats are designed to absorb the energy of an impact, reducing the severity of the impact to your body. However, if there is an explosion of any kind - such as a derailment or a broken rail - while you are in a forward-facing seat, your seat and the seat in front of you can significantly reduce the protection that your seat can provide.\n\nRear-facing seats, on the other hand, provide a significantly different type of protection. Instead of facing the direction of the train, they face towards the back of the carriage. This means that in the event of a crash, the seat and the seat in front of you can provide a much larger surface area for protection, by absorbing much of the impact. Additionally, if there\u2019s ever any kind of explosion or disaster, the seat also provides a somewhat protective barrier from the back of the carriage. \n\nIn conclusion - it can be difficult to decide which seat is best. However, if a crash was imminent, there are a number of considerations to take into account before making a decision. Taking the time to understand the difference between a forward-facing and a rear-facing seat can provide the best possible protection in the event of a crash.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18175}

Glass is such a chemically stable material that it rarely, if ever, interacts with the chemicals or materials stored in it, making it ideal for a variety of applications.\n\nGlass is an amorphous solid, meaning it has no defined structure and consists of chains of molecules that are randomly arranged. This makes it incredibly strong and impervious to most forms of attack, even strong acids and bases. As a result, glass is one of the least reactive substances known to man, only reacting with the most extreme of chemicals. This is why glass is often used to store extremely corrosive and hazardous chemicals and materials.\n\nGlass is also very chemically inert, meaning it will not react with any other material when in contact. This makes most substances that are stored in glass containers a safe bet; when exposed to dramatic temperature changes or other extreme environments, glass will not react with the contents inside. This makes it the perfect material for any number of applications, from food storage to chemical storage.\n\nFinally, the inert nature of glass makes it incredibly durable and resistant to wear and tear. This means that regular wear and tear or continual contact with dangerous chemicals will not damage or corrode the glass, making it an ideal material for chemicals that would normally be difficult to store.\n\nIn short, glass is an incredibly chemically stable material, which makes it perfect for a variety of applications. It is incredibly non-reactive and highly resistant to damage, making it ideal for hazardous materials and extreme environments. With so few materials exhibiting such properties, it is no wonder that glass is such a widely used material.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18176}
{"text":"The difference between thinking about something and actually doing it is a concept that has been debated and studied for a long time. It is sometimes referred to as the \u201cgap\u201d between thought and action.\n\nOn a very basic level, the difference between thinking and doing begins with the thought process. We can think of something without making any physical movement related to it, but physical action is required to actually do something. When we think of moving our arm, we may imagine what it would feel like to move it, but the arm itself won\u2019t actually move until we actively do so. This is possible because of the prefrontal cortex in the brain, which allows us to think and plan out our actions before we actually do them.\n\nSimilarly, when thinking of a word, we may actually verbalize it in our head, but until we actually say it aloud, the word remains only in our thoughts.\n\nThe concept of the gap between thought and action is often used to explain why changing habits and behaviors can be so difficult. For example, if we think about exercising, we may make certain plans in our head that we want to follow. But until we actually get up and make it happen, our thoughts will stay just that- thoughts.\n\nThe same principle applies to various other aspects of life, such as breaking bad habits or achieving goals. It is only when we take action and make the effort to do something that real lasting change can take place.\n\nTherefore, the difference between mere thought and action is an important one. While thinking of something can be a valuable starting point, true progress and achievement come from making the effort to act on our plans and intentions.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18177}

So, if the spacecraft is travelling at a high speed and emitting a signal every 1 second, we would not get the signal every second on Earth because it would become \u201cstretched out\" in relation to our own perception of time. \n\nTo provide a more concrete example, imagine that the spacecraft is travelling at 99.99% of the speed of light and emitting a signal every 1 second. From the spacecraft\u2019s reference, it is consistently transmitting a signal every 1 second. However, from the perspective of the observer, the signal appears to be spaced out over longer intervals of time as the craft continues to accelerate. As such, we may perceive the signals at intervals of 1.5 seconds, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, and so forth. \n\nThis phenomenon also applies to the case of objects moving in the opposite direction.

In this case, the signal from the beacon will appear to be compressed from our perspective \u2013 with the total duration between the successive signals appearing much shorter in relation to our own perception of time.\n\nUltimately, the rate at which we will receive the signal from the spacecraft is relative and depends on the speed at which the spacecraft is travelling.

This process generates a powerful stream of radiation. \n\nLooking solely at the size of the Andromeda Galaxy and knowing that it is home to a supermassive black hole, we can deduce that it has the potential to be an extremely powerful quasar. If it were to become one, it would be be the most prominent source of light in the night sky. \n\nA single quasar emits between 10 and 1000 times the light of its host galaxy and can be seen from great distances. In the case of the Andromeda Galaxy, that would mean a light magnitude of -18 to -30.

In a modern, domesticated environment, horses are greatly impacted by the activities humans put them through and the riding of them is no exception.\n\nRiding a horse requires them to be capable of carrying the weight of a human quickly and with precision, while maintaining balance and safety. Therefore, horses\u2019 muscle structure, skeleton, and cardiovascular system are heavily affected by the act of riding them. \n\nMuscles: Riding a horse engages most of its muscles, significantly strengthening the quadriceps, glutes, deltoids, and biceps of the animal, in order to provide the horse with the power and direction needed. Over time, this can result in an increase in muscle volume, strength and endurance.\n\nSkeleton: Many changes have been observed in a horse\u2019s skeleton due to riding. This includes shortened and more sloping hips, the downward rotation of the scapula, the development of joint range of motion and an increase in the size and shape of the withers and back. All these changes are an adaptation of the horse to carrying the weight of a rider and the protection of internal organs in the event of falls.\n\nCardiovascular System: As the horse\u2019s muscles are heavily engaged while being ridden, the cardiovascular system must provide them with an adequate amount of oxygen and glucose. This results in an adaptation of increased endurance and aerobic capacity, making the horse more capable of engaging in strenuous activities. This was observed in a 19th century study that showed horses used for racing had significantly larger hearts than those used for draught purposes.\n\nThe complicated physical adaptations horses must endure in order to become capable of being ridden should not go unnoticed.

{"text":"The answer to this question is simple but complex at the same time. Many people think that when you look at the night sky, it looks the same all the time, with the stars and planets appearing to be the same size relative to our naked eyes. The reason for this is because the stars and planets are so incredibly far away that their actual size is much smaller compared to our naked eye view.\n\nThe scale of the universe is so incredibly large that most astronomical sizes appear to be the same size to us. For example, the two stars in the night sky may look the same size, but they could actually be thousands of light-years away from each other. The same applies to planets and galaxies. Our naked eye can see them just fine, but all those hundreds of thousands, even millions of miles away, come across as just tiny dots in the night sky.\n\nSo, the main reason why stars and planets look the same size to us is because of their vast distances, combined with our observations from Earth that prevents us from perceiving their actual sizes. The twinkling of stars is caused by the different layers of Earth's atmosphere; when our naked eyes look at the stars and planets, we are basically seeing light from the depths of space rather than an actual size comparison.\n\nThat being said, there are some cases where we can see an object's actual size, such as with eclipses. During eclipses, the relative sizes of the moon and the sun are showcased; if the moon passes in front of the sun, it appears to cover it, blocking the sun's rays. You can also use telescopes to get a better view of distant astronomical objects and get a better idea of their respective sizes. \n\nOverall, it is understandable why most objects in the night sky look to be the same size relative to our naked eyes; they are so incredibly far away, combined with the effects of our atmosphere and Earth's position, that they appear to be the same size when viewed from our perspective. Although we may not be able to actually tell the size of the stars and planets, we can still enjoy the beauty of the night sky and its countless objects!","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18182}
{"text":"When someone has a cold, it is likely that they are dealing with some sort of virus. This virus affects the nose in particular, and can cause inflammation. During this period, the swelling of the nasal passages creates a blockage for one side of the nose. This blockage is in place because that side is significantly larger than the other, making it harder for air to move through evenly. \n\nOnce the virus has cleared, the swelling of the nose has also receded. However, this also presents a problem, as the smaller passageway is now the large one in the equation. As air is pushed or drawn through the nose, this larger passageway is able to almost completely block the nostril, allowing only small amounts of air to pass. This is why your second nostril may now become blocked.\n\nThe same concept applies to why your nostrils tend to switch being blocked throughout the day. As your body heats up, blood is being circulated at a faster rate. This results in the swelling of the already larger passageway, while the smaller one remains smaller due to its unaltered rate of circulation. This explains why the nostrils may switch being blocked in the morning versus night.\n\nOverall, when you have a cold, it makes sense why one side of your nose is blocked, and also why it closes when the other one does. It is due to the alterations in circulation as a result of the virus and inflammation, as well as physical size differences between the two passageways. These differences result in a cycle of alternating blockages that may be persistent until the cold is gone.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18183}

Therefore, more of the water we drink is retained and stored in our bodies, helping to keep us hydrated throughout the day.\n\nFinally, when the water is in the bloodstream it can be used in a variety of different ways. Some of the water is used to help carry out metabolic processes or to help transport nutrients and other substances around the body. The leftover water can also be absorbed deeper into our tissues and cells, sustaining them and providing the necessary hydration they need.\n\nTherefore, we can see that when we drink water it is taken up by our cells, retained in the body and then used in a variety of different ways. This distribution and usage of water is essential for our body to function properly, and so it's important to drink enough water every day to make sure our bodies receive the hydration they need.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18184}
{"text":"It is an interesting and important question, and the answer is not a simple one. In short, both are true. Astronomers have found that many galaxies, including our own Milky Way, possess supermassive black holes at their central core. The same can be said for other objects in the universe, such as quasars and active galactic nuclei. \n\nIt is theorized that the birth of galaxies and their stars, like the Sun and all other stellar objects, take place deep in the core of supermassive black holes. In this scenario, supermassive black holes act like a dense seed around which galaxies and their stars are formed. As matter is drawn into the black hole, shock waves are created, which then stimulate the formation of stars and galaxies. \n\nGalaxies themselves are composed of vast clouds of stars, and the process of star formation within them is continuous. Over time, the stars that are born within galaxies begin to experience gravitational pull and orbit around the galactic center. Any massive object at the galactic center, such as a supermassive black hole, exerts a strong gravitational force on the surrounding stars. As more stars become bound to the black hole, it begins to grow in size, and a powerful central gravitating force is established.\n\nThe formation of supermassive black holes, and the creation of galaxies around them, is thus a complex and ongoing process. Over time, the growth of galaxies are influenced by several different factors such as the merger of galaxies and the growth of black holes. \n\nSo, to answer the question, both a supermassive black hole forming in the center of galaxies, and galaxies forming around these black holes are true. The connection between the two is an intricate process, and the two processes are intrinsically linked.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18185}
{"text":"No, it is not possible to artificially introduce dopamine into someone's brain to make them feel rewarded for something they don't like. Dopamine is a neurochemical messenger in the brain and it is associated with feelings of pleasure and reward. When our brain is presented with something that is rewarding to us, it will release dopamine in the reward pathways of the brain, resulting in a feeling of pleasure, satisfaction, and motivation to engage in more of the same behavior. \n\nThe feeling of reward is an extremely complex process and dopamine is only one factor that plays into it. For reward to be experienced, there must be an expectation of reward and an understanding of what the reward is. Therefore, in order to artificially introduce dopamine to make someone feel rewarded for something they do not like, they must first comprehend what the reward is and expect that doing the action will lead to the reward. Without the expectation of a reward from the action, the dopamine release is not likely to be experienced as a reward.\n\nFurthermore, dopamine does not necessarily equate to feeling rewarded, as dopamine release is also associated with anticipation of reward and it does not always correlate with the intensity of reward felt. It is often believed that dopamine not only causes pleasure itself but rather it causes us to anticipate and predict pleasure. Therefore, dopamine can cause a person to predict and anticipate pleasure, but it does not necessarily cause pleasure from doing something that the person does not like.\n\nIn addition, it is important to note that dopamine is a neurotransmitter produced in multiple areas of the brain, rather than just a single location, and the release of dopamine in each area of the brain is orchestrated by neurons that are interconnected. Therefore, it is not feasible to artificial manipulate the complex network of neurons and neurotransmitters to induce feelings of reward in someone for something they don\u2019t like. \n\nIn conclusion, artificially introducing dopamine into someone's brain to make them feel rewarded for something they don't like is not possible. The feeling of reward is a complex process that involves many areas of the brain and, therefore, an artificial manipulation of dopamine to induce reward is unlikely to be the answer.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18186}
{"text":"On an atomic level, when we talk about something being shiny, dull, or reflective, it usually has to do with how the light is bouncing off the object that we are looking at. When the light hits an object, some of it will be absorbed by the material and some of it will bounce off in different directions. The amount of light that comes off an object and how it bounces off of it will determine how shiny, dull, or reflective it appears.\n\nFor something to appear shiny, that means that it is reflecting and bouncing off a lot of light in different directions. This means that the material is mostly made up of smooth materials like metal which can absorb and reflect a lot of the light that hits it.\n\nDull objects, on the other hand, will have much more light absorbed by them than reflected. This is usually because dull materials will have much more texture and bumps, making it harder for the light to bounce off and instead be absorbed by the material.\n\nLastly, reflective objects will send off a lot of light of the same wavelength that it absorbs from what object is shining light on it. This is why reflective materials like mirrors or glass will look so shiny. We call it reflective because the material reflects a lot of the light that comes towards it.\n\nAt an atomic level, all of this is happening when the light is bouncing off all of the atoms in the material and how the electrons respond to the wave of the light. The atoms in shiny objects are usually arranged in a very smooth and consistent way, making it easier for the light to bounce off in many different directions. In dull objects, the atoms are much more spread out, making it harder for the light to bounce off evenly and be reflected in one direction. Reflective materials, on the other hand, are made up of atoms that will absorb a lot of the light and then reflect what it absorbed back in the same direction.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, at an atomic level, the way the different atoms that make up the object are arranged and how the electrons are reacting to the light will determine how reflective a material appears.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18187}

That's really cool because computers usually store data in bytes. It's really amazing to think that our brains work kind of like tiny computers!\n\nI'm not totally sure, but I think one byte of data could fit inside one neuron.

Studies suggest not only that animals recognize the concept of death and their own potential demise, but also that they can show signs of mourning and mourning behavior when they experience loss.\n\nThe concept of mortality has been studied in a variety of species, including chimpanzees, gorillas, parrots, dogs, and cats. These studies suggest that animals may be aware of the concept of death, and the potential implications for their own lives.\n\nIn chimpanzees, for example, there have been reports of chimpanzees demonstrating a sense of loss and sorrow when their peers die. In one instance, a group of chimpanzees was observed mourning the passing of one of their own and forming a procession to accompany the remains. In other observed behaviors, chimpanzees have been observed grooming dead members of their group or touching the bodies of the deceased, as if to console themselves.\n\nIn parrots, a type of bird that has an impressive ability to learn and imitate, mourning behavior is a common response to the death of a mate. In some cases, parrot owners will report parrots vocalizing a loud and distressful whistle, and demonstrating behaviors that suggest a sense of loss and sorrow.\n\nIn dogs, it's been observed that they can display mourning behaviors when they suffer a loss. Dogs may become lethargic, they may lose their appetite, they may pace nervously, or cling to various items that belonged to their deceased companion. These behaviors suggest an awareness of the deceased, and a sense of loss and sadness.\n\nIn cats, there have been reports of cats searching for or calling for a deceased companion, and a decreased appetite or increased vocalization have been observed.\n\nThe level to which animals understand and experience the concept of mortality will likely vary from species to species and from individual to individual.

{"text":"Identical twins are an exceptional phenomenon where two individuals, who share 100 percent of the same DNA, often look slightly different from one another. Contrary to what many people may think, these characteristics are not due to environmental effects, but a result of the body\u2019s interpretation of that DNA. The reason identical twins can look different is a phenomenon called epigenetics.\n\nEpigenetics is the study of how genes are expressed \u2014 not their actual structure. When identical twins develop from a single fertilized egg, the DNA of both individuals is identical, but the way in which their genes are expressed can differ. This can be due to many different samples, including the timing of gene expression and the availability of specific proteins needed for the genes to work.\n\nFor example, a gene may be triggered in one twin, but not the other. In the twin where the gene is activated, the gene may be expressed in an alternate form, or at a different time. This causes one twin to have different levels of certain hormones that influence traits such as body length or facial features.\n\nThe environment around the twins can also affect how genes are expressed. For example, a different exposure to bacteria or viruses in the womb could lead to one twin having a slightly different appearance.\n\nEpigenetics is an incredibly varied and complex field of study. While the experts may never know the exact reasons why identical twins can look slightly different, this phenomenon is just another part of the marvel of identical twins.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18190}
{"text":"The lava lamp was first patented in 1963 by British entrepreneur Edward Craven Walker and continues to be a popular tabletop decoration. On the surface, these beguiling lamps may appear to work on mystery and magic, but the science behind a lava lamp is both simple and fascinating. \n\nThe basis of lava lamps is a combination of liquid and brightly colored wax. The secret behind their mesmerizing show is the difference in density between the two components. The cylindrical container that holds this strange concoction is usually filled with a special liquid which is denser than the other components and sits at the bottom of the container. When the lamp is turned on, a small light bulb on the base of the lamp is heated, causing the wax to gradually heat up and become less dense.\n\nAs the wax becomes less dense, it begins to rise above the denser liquid and forms large bubbles that move around within the lamp. When the bubbles reach the top of the cylinder, the cooler temperatures cause them to slowly sink to the bottom again. This continual cycle of rising and falling creates a unique slow moving display that fascinates. \n\nThe chemistry involved in the lava lamp is interesting and beneficial to scientists. The dense liquid found in a lava lamp is typically a salt solution, with the amount of salt used affecting the overall density of the liquid and the speed of the display. Scientists can also manipulate the properties of the wax to make it even brighter or create a wider range of colors. In addition, they can experiment with the gases put into the wax to figure out what mixtures will work best for different types of lamps.\n\nThe beauty of the lava lamp is that its mesmerizing movements have been captivating people since the 1960s. While the science behind a lava lamp is relatively simple, its effects are still entrancing, making it an eye-catching and beautiful addition to any household.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18191}
{"text":"The use of wet paper towel to chill a beverage rapidly is a lifehack which has been widely talked about and used, but many people are left unsure of the science behind it and its degree of efficiency. In order to understand the efficiency of this approach, it is necessary to consider the fundamental principles of heat transfer that cause the beverage to cool down. \n\nThe fundamental principles of heat transfer are conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation. Conduction is the greatest factor in the chilling of a beverage as it is the transfer of heat through direct contact. When a paper towel is wetted and wraps around the beverage, heat is transferred from the warmer beverage to the colder towel, which then dissipates to the surrounding environment. Convection can also be a factor, though less efficiently compared to conduction. This is the transfer of heat from a liquid or gas, such as the beverage, to a cool solid surface, in this case the wet paper towel, where the heat then dissipates and is dispersed. Radiation is not an effective method of cooling, but it can be beneficial. In this process, heat is transferred through infrared waves, where surface area and distance are the determinant factors of how efficiently the heat dissipates. Since in this case the beverage will be in direct contact with the wet paper towel, radiation will not be a particularly effective contributor to the cooling process. Finally, evaporation of the water droplets on the paper towel can contribute to cooling of the beverage as a side effect, however this is not the most effective method and is not the main contributor to cooling. \n\nIn conclusion, the lifehack of wrapping a beverage in a wet paper towel to expedite the cooling process is fairly efficient, as it is based on the principles of heat conduction. This process requires little energy and the transfer of heat is realized quickly. In an environment with no electricity, it may be the most efficient way to cool down a beverage.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18192}
{"text":"Wi-fi waves are like little balls of energy that travel through the air. They don't go forever because they get weak the farther they travel. The farther they travel, the weaker they become, until they eventually fade away. That's why wi-fi doesn't work in a field away from other people's wi-fi signals.\n\nThe reason why wi-fi waves don't go farther is because of interference. Interference is like a big crowd of people all talking at once. You can't hear any one person, but you can hear the noise from everyone all together. The same thing happens with wi-fi waves. All the different signals from computers and routers can get in the way and the wi-fi waves can't get past the interference. \n\nEven if there isn't any interference, wi-fi waves still fade away. They lose their energy as they travel, which keeps them from going too far. This is the same thing that happens to sound waves. If you shout far away from people, they can't hear you. That's because the energy in sound waves fades away too.\n\nWi-fi is also blocked by some materials, like metal, concrete, and brick. It's like a wall that can't be crossed. That's why it's important to keep your router away from metals and other materials that can interfere. \n\nWi-fi waves don't travel forever because they don't have enough energy to go that far. The farther they travel, the weaker they become, and other things like interference or materials can block them and make them fade away.

{"text":"The gravity of the moon does in fact create tidal waves on the earth\u2019s oceans. This is because the pull of the moon\u2019s gravity causes the bodies and fluids of the earth (in this case mainly the seas, lakes, and oceans) to bulge towards the moon, creating a rise in water levels known as \u201ctides\u201d. However, the gravity of the moon isn\u2019t strong enough to lift up tree leaves and other small animals because the size of the objects is too small and the distance between them and the moon is too far. \n\nThe moon\u2019s gravity applies a force on the earth\u2019s surface, called the tide, which is caused by the gravitational pull and accelleration of the moon. This pull causes the body of water around it to bulge out towards the moon, creating a rise in water levels known as tides. This effect is strongest when the moon is closest to the earth, known as \u201cperigee\u201d, but still the force of gravity of the moon is not strong enough to lift things up that have a small mass and are located far away from the moon.\n\nTo understand why the moon\u2019s gravity can\u2019t lift small objects, we have to remember that the gravitational force of a massive body decreases with distance. This is why the earth\u2019s gravity can\u2019t pull objects towards it from a distance: the gravitational force gets weaker as the objects gets farther away. The same is true for the moon- the force of the moon\u2019s gravity weakens with distance and it becomes too weak to lift up small objects like tree leaves and small animals. \n\nConsidering the size of a tree leaf or a small animal and how far these things are from the moon, the force of the moon\u2019s gravity on them would be almost negligible. Therefore, the moon\u2019s gravity isn\u2019t strong enough to lift up tree leaves or small animals- it can only affect larger objects, like the oceans.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18194}
{"text":"Yes, heat, humidity, and other atmospheric variables can affect wi-fi and other signals. This is due to the unique characteristics of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is not a perfectly insulated and unaltered state, and its properties are constantly changing depending on the weather, location, and season. Hence, the signal propagated through it can be hindered or obstructed due to the presence of various physical and chemical factors. \n\nHeat plays a primary role in affecting signals, as hot air carries fewer molecules than cold air. The velocity of wireless signals is dependent on the density of molecules present and the thermal energy of the medium. In addition, the refractive index of atmospheric air increases as the temperature rises. This in turn reduces the velocity and can cause the timing issues of receiving signals and the signals to be lost. Humidity is another factor that can disrupt signals, typically causing weakening and distortion of the signals. The absorption of moisture in the air affects the signal's velocity, refractive index, and frequency which result in signal loss or attenuation. Lastly, changes in atmospheric pressure can lead to signal incompatibility and reduced signal strength due to distortion of waves.\n\nOther atmospheric variables also play a role in affecting the signals, such as dust, wind and pollution. Dust particles can affect signals by creating physical obstructions that reduce the signal's effective range and strength. Wind can cause severe signal losses and fading if stronger than usual winds are present and may lead to a decrease in an area of reception. Lastly, air pollution can increase the atmospheres ability to absorb or reflect signals, leading to an increased tendency for the signals to fade and drop out, resulting in reduced signal quality.\n\nOverall, heat, humidity, and other atmospheric variables can have a significant effect on wi-fi and other signals. This can lead to weakening, fading, loss of signals, and timing issues which directly affect the speed, data transfer rate, and coverage area of wireless communications. Thus, monitoring and measuring the atmospheric conditions in an area is necessary in order to ensure optimal signal propagation and reduce the effects of these environmental factors.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18195}
{"text":"This is an interesting question, as we often think about how the earth accumulates dirt, but never consider how it is able to layer itself over time. There are three major ways that the earth accumulates dirt over time, which lead to the gradual layering of sedimentary deposits. \n\nThe first is erosion. This is when particles of dirt and debris are moved by forces of wind, rain and ice. Over time, this causes the material to become trapped and eventually form deposits, which can eventually bury objects completely. \n\nThe second is deposition. This is when eroded material is stopped on its journey, and is then deposited as layers of sediment. This happens as particles are held together by glue-like substances, forming sheets and slowly burying whatever is beneath it. \n\nThe third and final way is through tectonic activity. The earth is constantly shifting and changing, and through plate tectonics, large portions of land can break and re-form in a different way. When this happens, the dirt and sediment that is present on the surface is moved and can get buried, forming the layers of sedimentary rock. \n\nOver the past few centuries, all three of these processes have been at work. Tectonic activity has continued to form layers, as well as wind, rain and ice creating erosion and allowing sediment to get trapped and deposited. This is why we now find dinosaurs buried far below the earth\u2019s surface, as several centuries worth of dirt has been piled on top of them.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18196}
{"text":"Yes, absolutely. If all the polar ice caps melted, there would be a drastic change in the amount of saltiness in the ocean. The reason why the ocean water is salty is because, as water evaporates off the surface of the ocean, salt is left behind. If all the polar ice caps melted, that would drastically reduce the amount of evaporation happening in the ocean and therefore reduce the amount of salt left behind in the ocean water.\n\nIn addition to that, when the polar ice caps melt, freshwater would be added to the ocean, decreasing the level of salinity. When ice caps melt, they don't actually have any salt in them, as it's frozen in the ice crystals, so no matter how much ice melts, it will not add salt to the ocean. The melting of the ice caps would also bring a lot of freshwater to the sea. Freshwater has a very low concentration of salt, which greatly reduces the salinity of the ocean and makes it less salty.\n\nLastly, when the polar ice caps melt, the levels of polar air moisture would decrease significantly. This would mean that the humidity levels of the air around the ocean would change, which in turn would affect the rate of precipitation. When there is higher precipitation, then more freshwater is added to the ocean, causing the ocean water to become less salty.\n\nAll in all, if the polar ice caps melted, the ocean would become much less salty. This would be due to the fact that polar ice contains no salt, the increase of freshwater, and the decrease in evaporative processes.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18197}

However, there is evidence to suggest that the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way may have originally been something else. \n\nFirst, the size of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way is estimated to be \u201c4.5 million solar masses\u201d (Ginzburg, 2020). Such a large black hole could not have been formed from a single star, as is typical. Therefore, scientists have hypothesized that the current supermassive black hole could have formed by the gravitational merger of several smaller black holes over a period of time, a hypothesis known as 'Black Hole Mashing Theory' (Briguglio, 2015). \n\nSecond, computer simulations have shown that, even if the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way had been something else before, it is likely that it would have converged to form a single, supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Computer models developed by researchers at the University Of Arizona found that if the center of the Milky Way was initially populated with many smaller black holes, these would eventually merge and form a single, massive entity. The effects from the merging of these black holes that could have taken more than a billion years to have a discernible effect on the overall mass of the central black hole, making it difficult to trace its origins (DeVito et. Al., 2019). \n\nWhile it is not possible to say with absolute certainty that the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way was anything else prior to its current state, the evidence discussed above suggests that it could have been. The Black Hole Mashing Theory and computer simulations indicate that the supermassive black hole could have been the result of the gravitational merger of several smaller black holes, and that it would have taken a long period of time to reach its current form.\n\nReferences\n\nBriguglio, R.

Copper is found in wires, so it's easy to get ahold of and it's usually pretty good at transferring heat. Metals are usually a good choice, so if copper is too expensive other metals might work as well.\n\nFor cold conduction, silver is usually the best material. It's a bit harder to find and more expensive than copper, but it works very well at transferring cold. Silver is a natural \"coolant,\" so it is often used to keep things cold.\n\nOther materials like aluminum can work for both heat and cold conduction, but usually for larger projects like refrigerators or air conditioners.\n\nOverall, the choice of material for heat or cold conduction will depend on many factors, such as what it will be used for, budget, and availability.

{"text":"Yes, a laser beam can cast a shadow. This is because a laser beam is a form of light, and when light is blocked by a physical object, it produces a shadow.\n\nShadow formation happens because of the wavelength of the light being blocked. In general, the longer the light's wavelength, the harder it is for it to be blocked and cast a shadow. Laser beams are composed of light with very short wavelengths, allowing them to penetrate materials while still being able to spread in a distinguishable beam pattern. The shorter wavelength allows these beams to easily penetrate physical materials and cast a shadow.\n\nLaser shadows are also unique in that they appear to be two-dimensional. The shadow cast by a regular light source will still appear more 3D, because of the spread of the light. However, due to the short wavelength of the laser beam, the shadow it casts is much less diffuse, making it appear two-dimensional and much flatter.\n\nIn order to cast a laser beam shadow, the laser must first be placed on one side of the material. When that light begins to be blocked by the material, the shadow will form from the other side. The size of the shadow will depend heavily on the intensity of the light and the distance between the laser and the material being blocked. The further away the laser is from the material, the larger the shadow will be, and the dimmer the light, the harder it will be to see.\n\nThe shadows cast by laser beams can be incredibly detailed, and can even be used for certain applications. One of the most notable uses of laser beam shadows is for projection mapping, which is when an image is projected onto an object. Lasers are used to trace out detailed images, which are then projected onto a material and cast a very accurate shadow.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18201}
{"text":"When you're sick with a cold or the flu, your joints are likely to ache more than usual. This can range from mild soreness to more intense pain.\n\nThe first reason this happens is due to inflammation. When you have a cold or flu, the virus can cause inflammation to the joints and other areas of the body. This inflammation causes the joint pain. As the body's immune system fights the virus, it releases cytokines, which are inflammatory molecules, into the bloodstream. This can further increase the inflammation and pain.\n\nThe second reason your joints might ache is due to a decrease in movement. When you have a cold or the flu, your body is usually weak, making it difficult to move around. This decrease in activity can cause muscles around the joint to get stiff, leading to joint pain.\n\nFinally, some medications used to treat colds and flu can also cause joint pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids are the most common medications that can cause joint pain. Sometimes these medications don't show the effects until after a few days of taking them, so it may take a little longer for symptoms to start.\n\nIt's important to talk to your doctor if your joint pain is getting worse or lasting a long time. Your doctor can determine the best course of action and prescribe appropriate medications to help relieve your joint pain. They may also recommend physical therapy, over-the-counter pain medications, or other treatments.\n\nTherefore, joint ache is common when you get the cold or flu because of inflammation, decreased activity and possibly some medications used to treat colds and flu.

{"text":"Magnets and electrons are two different objects that both make use of a force field. The force field they use is created by a combination of their partial charges and the energy within their surrounding environment. \n\nMagnets get their magnetic fields through a process known as magnetization. It typically involves the presence of iron oxide present in the magnet. In a phenomenon known as ferromagnetism, the small particles that make up the iron oxide atoms become aligned in a pattern. Once this alignment takes place, the atoms are said to be magnetized. This creates a strong magnetic field capable of pulling in other magnets from a distance. \n\nElectric fields around electrons are created by the charges that each electron has. Electrons are made up of negatively charged particles known as protons, and positively charged particles called neutrons. In a vacuum, electrons are experiencing a net electric force as felt by behaviors such as attraction and repulsion. These force fields have the ability to affect other electric fields and objects around them. \n\nThe force fields of both magnets and electrons are created by the exchange of energy in their environment. Magnets, upon being magnetized, acquire the surrounding energy and form a magnetic field. Electrons, through the exchange of energy with other positively and negatively charged particles, form a net electric field. In both cases, each object is increasing its own force-field by actively exchanging and using energy in its environment. \n\nIn summary, magnets and electrons both develop their own force fields, although the mechanisms by which they do are vastly different. Magnets form their magnetic fields through a process known as magnetization, which involves the alignment of iron oxide atoms. Electrons create electric fields from the exchange of energy from the positive and negative particles present in them. Through the absorption and release of energy around them, magnets and electrons are able to increase their force fields, which makes them capable of taking in and producing energy within their environment.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18203}
{"text":"No, the crash is not the same. When two cars collide, their combined speed has a great influence on the severity of the crash. In this situation, when the car travelling at 90 km\/h strikes the slower vehicle from the rear, their combined speed is 210 km\/h. This is considerably higher than the combined speed of 30 km\/h when a car travelling at that speed strikes a vehicle at rest.\n\nAt higher combined crash speeds, the physical forces involved in the crash increase exponentially. This means that the injured occupants of the cars in the crash will likely experience much higher levels of force than if the cars were travelling at lower speeds. The forces can be so extreme that components of the car get displaced, openings in the car frame become larger and parts may even tear away. This can lead to much more serious injuries and the car may be a total write-off.\n\nThe type of collision also plays a role in how severe it will be. In a head-on crash, two vehicles travelling at very different speeds will hit each other with the combined speed of both of them. If a relatively slow car hits a stationary one, the forces involved are much lower. In a rear-end collision, although the speed of the car in the rear is significant, the deceleration involved when it collides with the car in front reduces the forces involved.\n\nSo to answer the question directly, no, the crash with the two cars travelling at 90km\/h and 120km\/h is not the same as if a car travelling at 30km\/h hit a car that is not moving. The two vehicles colliding at the combined speed of 210km\/h will create forces much greater than at the combined speed of 30 km\/h. This difference in speed is the main factor that contributes to the severity of the crash.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18204}
{"text":"Clouds are created when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses, forming tiny water droplets or ice crystals. Warm air can hold more water vapor before it starts to condense, so when air rises it expands and cools, prompting the water vapor to condense and fall out as precipitation, such as rain or snow.\n\nAs the droplets and ice crystals form, they separate into warmer and cooler areas, with the colder areas sinking to the bottom and the warmer areas rising. This is due to the saturation vapor pressure in the air. The cool air is more dense and is heavier than the warm air, so it drops down and flattens out towards the surface of the Earth. This is what gives fluffy cumulus clouds (the kind with flat bottoms and rounded tops) their distinct shape. \n\nWhen the air rises higher, it cools and becomes even denser, eventually reaching its dew point and condensing into pools of rain or snow that fall from the sky. The clouds continue to form up to the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere where weather occurs) and the stratosphere (the part of the atmosphere where there is less humidity). \n\nAt the tropopause, winds within the atmosphere create a strong updraft, lifting the clouds and dispersing the water droplets or ice crystals into the stratosphere. This upward flow, known as the Hadley circulation, is why we see the tops of clouds generally being fluffy and the bottoms remaining mostly flat.\n\nThe other factor that affects the shape of clouds is wind. When air moves horizontally it can break apart the clouds and give them a more wispy appearance, as opposed to their rounded, fluffy-topped appearance. So, to sum up, clouds get their fluffy tops and flat bottoms from a combination of rising air and winds throughout the atmosphere.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18205}
{"text":"Since the 19th century, scientists had a general understanding that space was a vacuum and space exploration revealed that outer space was not filled with oxygen. It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s, however, that we were able to confirm that there was no oxygen in space for sure.\n\nThough humans had already invented the telescope as far back as 1608, we were still many centuries away from being able to explore the cosmos in detail. So, the true nature of space still remained largely unknown. In addition, it was difficult to even conceive of whether or not oxygen could exist outside of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, since oxygen is essential for life on the planet.\n\nIt did not remain so much of a mystery any longer, once modern space probes and satellites were developed during the 1950s and 60s. This was the first time we were able to launch instruments out of our atmosphere and get direct readings on what the space environment was really like.\n\nThe first to detect the lack of oxygen in space came in 1962 with the Mariner I spacecraft, which was launched by NASA. The spacecraft was able to provide an accurate estimation of the air\u2019s composition as it traveled further and further away from Earth. Ultimately, this initial mission revealed the much-expected result of a near-vacuum, void of oxygen and other life-sustaining gas molecules.\n\nThis discovery was revolutionary, as it allowed us to truly understand the environment outside of our own atmosphere. It showed that many of the assumptions we had about the universe\u2014 that it was filled with life-sustaining gas molecules, including oxygen\u2014 were false. But despite a lack of oxygen, this also revealed that we could still explore the depths of space and uncover a range of other amazing phenomena, such as various planets, stars, and galaxies.\n\nGiven the lack of oxygen in space, human travel to outer space requires us to use other means of providing oxygen, such as pressurizing our spacecraft cabins with a regulated atmosphere, using oxygen tanks, and other methods. Without our space probes and other technological advances, we would still remain largely ignorant to the reality of the dangers and difficulties involved with venturing into outer space.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18206}
{"text":"When individuals initiate a retrieval process, in which we are attempting to remember something, an area of the brain known as the Reticular Activation System (RAS) is activated. Located between the spinal cord and forebrain, the RAS monitors incoming signals from the environment, focusing them on the specific region of the brain associated with the task at hand. When attempting to remember a memory, this modulation of activity encourages the neuron pathways associated with the memory to fire.\n\nOnce the RAS has selected the appropriate patterns of activity within the brain, the next step in the retrieval process is the establishment and strengthening of a cognitive map. This cognitive map is made up of multiple layers of neurons located throughout the cerebral cortex and associated pathways, each providing independent pieces of information that, when combined, allow us to recall the memory. Much like a puzzle, the pieces of the memory each have unique characteristics that, when combined, form the complete memory.\n\nAs the cognitive map continues to take shape, the hippocampus plays an important role in the retrieval process. The hippocampus acts as an indexing system, actively coordinating the various parts of the memory. It combines information from multiple sources, creating associations between different parts of the memory and helping to form a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nDuring the retrieval process, serotonin and dopamine also play a role in activating the appropriate neural pathways and helping to form the cognitive map. These neurotransmitters signal the release of hormones, such as norepinephrine, which can drastically increase heart rate, breathing, and alertness\u2014all of which help form and solidify the memory at hand.\n\nThe successful retrieval of a memory takes place when all of these components come together to form a cohesive map of an individual\u2019s experience. The RAS acts as a gatekeeper, guiding the brain to the appropriate neuron pathways to form the cognitive map. Serotonin and dopamine signal the release of hormones to help strengthen the map. And finally, the hippocampus combines the pieces of the memory together to create a lasting and more complete recollection of a past experience.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18207}
{"text":"Oh wow, underwater tunnels! That's really cool. I'm not sure how they build them, but I'm going to do my best to look into it and figure out how!\n\nWell, I think it starts with the engineers who design it. They make the plan for a tunnel that is strong enough to withstand the kind of pressure that comes from being underwater. Then, the builders get to work!\n\nFirst, they dig a giant trench down from the surface of the water level and into the tunnel path. This is done with a big drill and machinery, like big drills and backhoes. Then, concrete and other materials like steel and special waterproof pipes are used to create the tunnel structure.\n\nThe builders then gradually fill the tunnel, starting from the bottom up so it all stays nice and waterproof and doesn't flood, because obviously, that would be really bad! In addition, workers have to be careful to make sure that any water that is found in the trench is pulled out, or it can get into the tunnel and make it unstable.\n\nAlso, special machines are used to continuously monitor the conditions of the construction site and they detect any kind of pressure buildup or water leaks and alert the workers quickly so they can prevent or fix the problems right away.\n\nFinally, after the tunnel is finished, it's tested for strength and waterproofness. They make sure it can withstand the pressure of the water and if there's a weak spot, they can fix it before the tunnel is opened to people.\n\nOverall, underwater tunnels take a lot of careful planning and safety measures to ensure that it won't flood and it will remain stable and safe during and after construction.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18208}
{"text":"Yes, some non-human animals do deliberately combine foods for eating simultaneously and even prepare meals with more than one ingredient. \n\nFor example, primates such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas demonstrate a wide variety of food combining behaviors. They often pick different components of a meal separately, examining them before deciding which ones to eat together. They often share the food they have picked and feast together as a group, eating different combinations depending on the collective preferences of the group. \n\nBirds also demonstrate an impressive amount of food-combining behavior. From crows to woodpeckers and songbirds, they all display an array of behaviors related to roosting, gathering, and preparation of their meals. Specifically, birds\u2019 ability to combine meal ingredients is often cited and documented in scientific studies. For example, birds of prey sometimes store pieces of prey inside small crevices and then come back to eat them at a later time. \n\nIn addition to birds and primates, some carnivorous animals such as cats and dogs also demonstrate sophisticated food-combining behavior. Cats, for instance, may eat one food item and then come back later to eat a different one. Dogs may also search for and explore different food items when scavenging for meals.  \n\nOverall, it seems that deliberate food-combining behavior is widespread across various species of animals in the animal kingdom. This behavior demonstrates a sophisticated degree of understanding regarding the components of a meal and how they can be combined together to create a desirable and nutritious meal.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18209}
{"text":"Nerve damage, unfortunately, is one of the most challenging injuries to repair. Even if a nerve is not completely damaged, its functions may be impaired. Thankfully, the body does have its own unique couple of ways to repair nerve damage with some promising treatments as research continues.\n\nOne way that nerve damage can be repaired is with what is called axonal sprouting \u2013 when nerve fibers regrow after being damaged. Damaged nerves in the extremities may cause numbness, weakness, paralysis, and many other symptoms. When a nerve is repaired, it can often regain its ability to send electrical signals and help the body to recover some of its lost control. In some cases, this repair can happen naturally, but other times, physical therapy, medication, or surgery may be necessary to help the nerves to heal properly.\n\nWhen the nerve is not completely severed but still cannot conduct electrical signals, something called Conduction Block can help. This involves using a Pacemaker-like device that delivers a low-level electrical field that enables the nerve cells to pass signals along in a more consistent and normal pattern. This form of treatment is often used for people who are suffering from multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and other forms of nerve damage.\n\nNo matter how it\u2019s treated, nerve injuries can take a long time to recover from, and some physical effects can be permanent. The best way to know if the nerves are permanently damaged is to consult with a medical professional who can review your medical history and any imaging tests taken and make an assessment.\n\nThe good news is that even though there is no cure-all for nerve damage, we are constantly learning more about these challenges. With advanced imaging technology and improved treatment options, as well as researchers and scientists continuing to develop new treatments, there is still hope for many people who are suffering from nerve damage. In many cases, the right combination of therapies and treatments can lead to the recovery of function and, in some cases, complete resolution of nerve damage.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18210}
{"text":"Honeybee workers are typically known for their short multi-week lifespans, but depending on the species, the life expectancy can be as short as a month or two. This leaves the question of how colonies manage the high mortality rate and how death is processed in a hive.\n\nOne way that colonies cope with death is by replacing aged bees with new individuals so the hive can continually maintain a healthy population. When an older bee suddenly dies, typically juvenile bees, already having been groomed to the task, will step up to fill the position. This expectation of mortality and subsequent grooming of younger workers is thought to provide an evolutionary advantage to the hive by satisfying future needs with new individuals and maintaining colony productivity.\n\nAnother way colonies manage the carcasses is by employing 'bee cleanings' or 'bee removals.' This process involves four to five worker bees entering the dead bee, embedding their mandibles into the body and then carrying it out of the hive. This practice is thought to help prevent the spread of disease and parasitic mite infestations by removing the dead bee from the environment.\n\nFinally, colonies rely on a specific form of communication called \u2018piping\u2019 to inform the entire hive of a death. Piping is the result of a particular bee shaking its abdomen to send an acoustic signal to the rest of the colony. Individuals in the vicinity of the deceased will interpret these signals and respond in kind by buzzing their wings and\/or mandibles. The purpose of this behavior is thought to be an iconicly represented sign of mourning or potentially to notify other bees of a danger to quickly disperse.\n\nIn conclusion, colonies process death by utilizing the evolutionary advantage of grooming workers to replace those that have died, performing cleanup operations, and informing other bees of their death. While it is a difficult process, understanding how honeybee workers manage death is essential to understanding their societies.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18211}
{"text":"No, mosquitoes do not share blood with each other. The primary purpose of mosquitoes using their proboscis to draw blood from another living thing is to receive a blood meal and not to share blood with another mosquito. The blood meal is used to acquire essential proteins that help in development of eggs. Some species of mosquitoes have been observed feeding on their dead peers, thus it could appear that mosquitoes \u201csteal\u201d blood from other mosquitoes, however, this is more so to acquire these vital proteins for egg development rather than \u201cstealing\u201d blood.\n\nWhen it comes to blood sharing, some species of mosquitoes do display behaviors that could be considered blood sharing as they tend to feed in groups, however, these mosquitoes are actually obtaining their blood meal from the same source and not from each other. The source of the blood meal that they share is typically their host, it can be a human or another living thing.\n\nThus, while it might appear that some mosquito species are sharing blood, it is actually a form of cooperative feeding where the mosquitoes collectively feed on the same host. This behavior is beneficial to the mosquitoes as it significantly speeds up the process of obtaining the necessary quantities of blood for egg development. Therefore, the answer to the questions posed is no, mosquitoes do not share blood with each other; they feed in groups but they do not directly receive blood from each other.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18212}
{"text":"As a person ages, there are several physical changes that can affect the frequency of nighttime bedwetting. The most common explanation is that the body produces less vasopressin, a hormone that helps keep urine in the bladder until we can wake up and use the bathroom. As people age, they also tend to become more aware of the need to use the bathroom. This increased awareness is largely due to the physical changes in their bladder muscles and nerves that allow them to recognize when the bladder needs emptying.\n\nThe hormone vasopressin is made in the hypothalamus of the brain and launched when we fall asleep. Its role is to signal the brain to keep the bladder muscles contracted and reduce urine production, helping to keep urine in the bladder until we wake up. As we age, however, our bodies produce less and less of this hormone, allowing for more urine to be released during sleep. This can affect the ability of the bladder to control urine and lead to more frequent episodes of nighttime bedwetting.\n\nIn addition to changes in hormone production, there are other physical changes that can contribute to less frequent nighttime bedwetting. As we age, the muscles of our bladder and other organs weaken, meaning they are less able to hold urine in and release it at the appropriate times. This can lead to a condition called overactive bladder which can cause the sufferer to feel a strong and urgent urge to urinate at inappropriate times, resulting in nighttime accidents.\n\nFinally, age may cause changes in the nerves and hormones associated with the bladder. As we age, the nerves that control bladder function become less sensitive, meaning they must be stimulated more strongly before sending a signal to the brain that it is time to use the bathroom. This can result in the brain receiving fewer signals to use the bathroom, resulting in less frequent bathroom trips.\n\nIn conclusion, as people age, their bodies naturally produce less hormone and experience physical changes in their bladder and nerve function that can lead to less frequent episodes of nighttime bedwetting. However, regardless of age, proper hydration and toilet habits are important for optimizing bladder functioning and helping to manage nighttime Bed Wetting.","label":1,"model":"davinci","source":"reddit","id":18213}
{"text":"No, if two humans (male and female) were unexposed to sex their entire lives, they would not instinctively know how to have sex.

The libretto is credited to Viktor Krylov, and is based on Alexander Pushkin's 1822 poem The Prisoner of the Caucasus.\n\nThe English title has been rendered also as Prisoner in the Caucasus and The Captive in the Caucasus.\n\nThe opera was preceded on the Russian stage by choreographer Charles Didelot's ballet of 1825.\n\nComposition\n\nThe opera was composed in three versions.  The first, in 1857\u20131858, consisted of only two acts (which later became Acts I and III), but its staging was cancelled due to poor orchestration and insufficient length.  Meanwhile, the overture, orchestrated by Mily Balakirev, could be heard in concerts.  Many years later, Cui decided to revise the two-act work: during 1881-1882 he added a new middle act (Act II) and another dance to Act III. This version constituted the score for the Russian premiere.  In 1885, with the prospect of a Belgian production, he expanded the finale of Act II, creating the third version of the opera.\n\nPerformance history\nPrisoner of the Caucasus was premiered on 4 February 1883 (Old Style), at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg under the conductorship of Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk.  This opera became the most widely performed of the composer's full-length operas.  Its production in Li\u00e8ge in 1886 \u2014 made possible in no small way by the enthusiastic support of Cui's friend, La Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau \u2014 marked the first time that an opera by \"The Mighty Handful\" was performed in the West.  Nevertheless, with this exception, the opera seems to have never been staged outside of Imperial Russia and to have fallen out of the repertory in Russia after the composer's death.\n\nRoles\n\nSynopsis\n\nPlace:Caucasus, in a mountain aoul\n\nAct I. After the men of the aoul pray to Allah, Kazenbek tells his melancholy daughter, Fatima, that a bridegroom has been chosen for her.  She meditates on her sorrow.  Suddenly a crowd of highlanders arrive, bringing along a Russian Prisoner that Fatima's bridegroom has captured as a wedding gift.  Fatima begins to sympathize and eventually to fall in love with the Prisoner.\n\nThe Prisoner is left alone until night, when Fatima secretly brings him some food.  After they part, a highlander runs in to tell Kazenbek of a group of Russians raiding a nearby aoul.  The people come out to join in the combat against the despised enemy.\n\nAct II. A group of women congratulates Fatima on her impending nuptials. After they leave, Fatima reveals her sadness to her friend Mar'iam.  Hearing the approaching steps of Kazenbek and Fekherdin, the two of them hide behind a curtain while overhearing the conversation.  The mullah has had a dream revealing Fatima's love for the Russian Prisoner.  The two men exit.\n\nThen the bridegroom, Abubeker, arrives.  He expresses his love for Fatima.  She greets him, and gifts from the groom are presented.  Abubeker gives the Prisoner to Kazenbek, who hates the Russian.  The people condemn the Prisoner to death, which he welcomes to end his suffering.\n\nAct III.  At the wedding feast, the people praise the bridegroom.  The women, then the men, perform dances.  After Mar'iam sings a Circassian song, all exit except for the newlyweds.  Fatima is still sad, and Abubeker asks the reason.  When they exit, the shackled Prisoner enters.  Then Fatima appears; she urges the Prisoner to escape and frees him.  He tells her that he loves not her, but another in his homeland.  She is devastated as he runs away.\n\nMar'iam appears and tells Fatima that the entire village is preparing to take revenge on the Russian.  The people arrive and are horrified at the news of Fatima's actions.  As they set out to kill her, Fatima stabs herself to death.

{"text":"The Myth of Fingerprints is a 1997 American drama film written and directed by Bart Freundlich. It stars Blythe Danner, Roy Scheider, Noah Wyle, and Julianne Moore (who later married Freundlich). The story follows the gathering of a dysfunctional family during Thanksgiving in New England.\n\nThe film premiered at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival and later received a limited release on September 17, 1997. The film's title originates from Paul Simon's 1986 song \"All Around the World or the Myth of Fingerprints\" and is a reference to the idea of blood ties and differing personalities amongst family members.\n\nPlot\nThree adult children reconvene at their family homestead in Maine for the Thanksgiving holiday. Though mother Lena is warm and engaging, father Hal is aloof. Artist Mia, the eldest sibling, arrives with her psychotherapist boyfriend, Elliott. Jake, who was considered the popular jock of the family, brings along his outspoken girlfriend Margaret. Warren, the youngest son, arrives alone, having not been home for three years. Youngest kid Leigh still lives with her parents. \n\nOver the course of the weekend, long-simmering resentments between family members come to the surface. Jake cannot bring himself to admit his love for Margaret, while Warren, still pining for his ex-girlfriend Daphne, meets up with her while in town and learns some upsetting news which leads to a physical confrontation with his father. Mia reunites with Cezanne, a former grade-school classmate who has long had a crush on her.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nWriter-director Bart Freundlich was able to secure big names for the ensemble cast on the strength of his screenplay. Said Roy Scheider, ''I did it because of the story. Bart wrote characters you wanted to play. All of us know it's unlikely the film will make money, but we're always looking for something this interesting. He wrote characters that really grab you.''\n\nOf the film's title, Freundlich explained, \"A fingerprint points to the fact that all these people are genetically related and, in a lot of ways, are very similar to one another. But the children in the family have also developed very differently from one another. The question it presents is: how much are their identities tied to where they grew up and to who was around them? And how much of their personalities have they had to create from scratch in order to go on with their lives? That's what fingerprints represent to me--these people's identities: something that on the one hand is genetic, and thus inherited, and yet at the same time is completely unique.\"\n\nThe film was shot in Andover, Bethel, and Waterville, Maine.\n\nRelease\nThe film had its world premiere at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, where it was acquired by Sony Pictures Classics. A theatrical release was initially planned for that April, but Sony decided to hold onto it until the fall season.\n\nCritical reception \nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Myth of Fingerprints has an approval rating of 60% based on 20 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nThe performances of the ensemble cast were praised, with Todd McCarthy of Variety noting \"Freundlich has a knack for clever, amusing lines that reveal character traits and attitudes.\" Criticisms centered on the screenplay and how it did not sufficiently flesh out the characters and their relationships with one another. Stephen Holden of The New York Times opined the film fails \"to knit its self-pitying characters into a credible family unit\", and multiple critics felt the behavior of family patriarch Hal was left unaddressed.\n\nCharles Taylor of Salon called Moore a \"startlingly intelligent actress,\u201d but noted in the film she is stuck playing a \u201cconception, not a part.\" He expressed that of all the family members, Danner\u2019s character is the one that most feels like a fully realized person. Taylor concluded, \"The Myth of Fingerprints, with its sensitive acoustic music and finicky composed shots of wintry landscapes and relentlessly subdued tone, is a reminder of the problem identified by Pauline Kael in her reviews of Interiors and Ordinary People: Movies about WASP repression invariably wind up aping the tidy, stultified lives they're meant to reveal. The Myth of Fingerprints is only 90 minutes long, but...you can't help thinking that if you were watching a Jewish family or an Italian one, the air would be cleared -- and you'd be out of the theater -- a hell of a lot quicker.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n Official site at Sony Pictures Classics\n\n1997 films\n1997 drama films\nFilms about dysfunctional families\nThanksgiving in films\nFilms directed by Bart Freundlich\nFilms shot in Maine\nFilms set in Maine\nAmerican independent films\n1997 independent films\nSony Pictures Classics films\nFilms about domestic violence\n1997 directorial debut films\n1990s English-language films\n1990s American films","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79426}
{"text":"Validity and liceity are concepts in the Catholic Church. Validity designates an action which produces the effects intended; an action which does not produces the effects intended is considered \"invalid\". Liceity designates an action which has been performed legitimately; an action which has not  been performed legitimately is considered \"illicit\". Some actions can be illicit, but still be valid.\n\nCatholic canon law also lays down rules for licit, also called lawful, placing of the act, along with criteria to determine its validity or invalidity. Valid but illicit or valid but illegal () is a description applied in the Catholic Church to describe either an unauthorized celebration of a sacrament or an improperly placed juridic act that nevertheless has effect. Validity is presumed whenever an act is performed by a qualified person and includes those things which essentially constitute the act itself as well as the formalities and requirements imposed by law for the validity of the act.\n\nBaptism\nThe 1983 Code of Canon Law states: \"Except in a case of necessity, it is unlawful for anyone without due permission to confer baptism outside his own territory, not even upon his own subjects\". In the Latin Church, administration of baptism is one of the functions especially entrusted to the parish priest.\n\nHowever, according to the same Code, any person, even someone not baptized, can baptize, if he has the required intention. The intention required is to will to do what the Catholic Church does when she baptizes, and to apply the Trinitarian baptismal formula.\n\nIn 2008, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) stated the baptism formulae \"I baptize you in the name of the Creator, and of the Redeemer, and of the Sanctifier\" and \"I baptize you in the name of the Creator, and of the Liberator, and of the Sustainer\", were invalid.\n\nIn 2020, the CDF stated the formula \"We baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\" was invalid for the purposes of conferring baptism. This made it so Matthew Hood, a Catholic priest of Detroit who had been baptised by Mark Springer by this formula, was not considered a priest anymore as Hood had been baptised with this formula (Hood was later properly baptised and ordained). This 2020 statement created other difficulties, as other people from Detroit had been baptised with the same formula by Springer, and other people had received sacraments from Hood since the latter's ordination 2017. Due to the same 2020 statement, another US priest, Andr\u00e9s Arango, who had baptised using the same formula, had to properly baptise those he had invalidly baptised. Thomas Reese and retired sacramental theology prof. Peter Fink have criticized the CDF statement, saying the \"We\" formula was valid.\n\nConfirmation\nIn the Latin Catholic Church, a bishop is the ordinary minister of confirmation and he may licitly administer it to his own subjects everywhere and, in his own territory, even to Catholics who are not his subjects, unless their ordinary has expressly forbidden it. In the Latin Catholic Church, simple priests (presbyters) can validly and licitly confirm in some circumstances, such as when they baptize adults or receive them into the church and when there is danger of death.\n\nPriests of the Eastern Catholic churches can validly confer the sacrament on any Catholic, even a Catholic of the Latin Church, but they can do so licitly only on those who belong to their own particular church and on other Catholics who meet the conditions of either being their subjects or of being lawfully baptized by them, or of being in danger of death.\n\nEucharist\nA prime example of valid but illicit celebration of a sacrament would be the use of leavened wheaten bread for the Eucharist in the Latin Church or in certain Eastern Catholic Churches. If, on the other hand, rice or rye flour are used instead of wheat, or if butter, honey, or eggs are added, particularly in large quantities, the Mass would be invalid (\"transubstantiation\" would not occur).\n\nLikewise, wine used for the Eucharist must be valid. Invalid wine would be any wine made of non-grape fruits or wine mixed with any other substance apart from \"a small quantity of water\".\n\nA priest who has been laicized, suspended, or excommunicated is not to say Mass, but if the Mass is said, it is considered valid but illicit.\n\nPenance\nChurch laws regarding confession require that priests who are hearing confessions must have valid faculties and jurisdiction. As penance is not only a sacramental act but also one of jurisdiction, such faculties are required for both for validity and liceity.\n\nThose who are provided with the faculty of hearing confessions by reason of office or grant of a competent superior of a religious institute or society of apostolic life possess the same faculty everywhere by the law itself as regards members and others living day and night in the house of the institute or society. They also use the faculty licitly unless some major superior has denied it in a particular case as regards his own subjects.\n\nConfessions in which the priest does not have the faculties to hear confession, yet without good reason pretends to have them, are valid but illicit. The church supplants the faculties leading to validity of the sacrament (canon 144).\n\nPope Francis allowed priests of the canonically irregular Society of Saint Pius X to hear confessions during the Year of Mercy, in 2015 and 2016; Pope Francis extended the concession indefinitely in the apostolic letter Misericordia et Misera of 20 Nov. 2016.\n\nAnointing of the sick\nEvery priest can administer the sacrament of anointing of the sick validly. The duty and the right to administer it pertains to the priest to whom the spiritual care of the person concerned is entrusted. However, any other priest may administer it instead for a good reason if he has the presumed consent of the priest who has the duty and right.\n\nHoly orders\nAll bishops are able to ordain a deacon, priest, or bishop. In the sacrament of holy orders, a valid but illicit ordination, as the name suggests, is an ordination in which a bishop uses his valid ability to ordain someone a bishop without having first received the required authorization. The same would apply to a bishop's ordaining of a man who has not undergone and completed necessary seminary schooling, as required by canon law. The bishop is then acting in a manner deemed illicit or illegal.\n\nA Roman Catholic bishop who consecrates someone to the episcopate without a mandate from the pope is automatically excommunicated according to Catholic canon law, even if his ordination may be considered valid. The person who receives consecration from him is also automatically excommunicated. The excommunication can be lifted by only the Holy See.\n\nIn the 20th century, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre was automatically excommunicated for his valid but illicit ordinations of four bishops for the SSPX without a papal mandate. After Lefebvre's death, the Holy See, on 21 January 2009, lifted the excommunication of the four bishops. However, his defenders argue that he acted under grave necessity, which the 1983 canon law stipulates is an excuse to avoid automatic excommunication in this case (canon 1323, \u00a74).\n\nMarriage\nA marriage celebrated in due form but without express permission of the competent authority of the Catholic Church between a Catholic and another baptized person enrolled in a church or ecclesial community not in full communion with the Catholic Church is \"prohibited\" (illicit) but valid. On the other hand, a marriage celebrated in due form between a Catholic and an unbaptized person is invalid unless dispensation has previously been obtained from the competent church authority.\n\nOther cases in which a marriage is both illicit and invalid are indicated in canons 1083 to 1094 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law.\n\nSee also\nValid but irregular\nEpiscopi vagantes\nIndependent Catholic churches\nSedeprivationism\nConditional sacrament\nSacramental character\nSacramental matter and form\nEx opere operato\n\nReferences\n\nSacramental law\nCatholic Church legal terminology","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79427}

{"text":"Pictionary is an American television game show which aired in syndication during the 1997\u20131998 season. The game was based on the board game of the same name where contestants guessed words and phrases based on drawings. Alan Thicke hosted the show with Joe Cipriano announcing. The series was a production of Kline and Friends and was distributed by Worldvision Enterprises.\n\nPictionary had a similar format to the earlier Win, Lose or Draw, which Kline's company also produced. The game mechanic was virtually identical, with two teams consisting of two celebrities and a civilian contestant competing.\n\nThe series was recorded at CBS Television City in Hollywood.\n\nRound 1\nInitially, both celebrities were each given two phrases to relay to their partners by drawing. There was a connecting word in both phrases (e.g., \"Red Necks, White Socks, and Blue Ribbon Beer\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" \"red\" being the connector). If they were both successfully guessed, the civilian contestant won $200. After both teams had taken a turn, a second set of phrases was played.\n\nLater in the series' run, the round was modified slightly. This time, the celebrities drew as many phrases as they could in the time limit of 45 seconds and each correct guess paid off at $100.\n\nRound 2\nPlayers took turns drawing a series of puzzles for three minutes. This time, each puzzle had a different connecting word. Correct answers were worth $100, and if the team was stumped the player at the drawing board could pass the marker off to one of his\/her teammates. The team in the lead played first, followed by the opposing team.\n\nThe team with the most money at the end of the round won the game and advanced to the bonus round. If both teams were tied, Thicke would draw a tie-breaking puzzle, with the first team to answer correctly becoming the winner. Regardless, both teams kept their money.\n\nBonus round\nIn the bonus round, one team member was selected by his teammates to draw single-word puzzles instead of phrases for this 90-second round. Each word was connected to the word before it in chain fashion, such as Peanut-Butter-Bread-Basket-etc.\n\nThe first four (originally three) words were worth $100 each. The next three that followed would be worth $300. Every word after that was worth an additional $1,000. Play stopped when the timer ran out and the civilian player won whatever money the team had accumulated.\n\nOriginally, there were returning champions, who remained on the show until they were defeated or reached the Friday show of any given week (due to weeks airing out of sequence from when they were taped). Within two months, however, they were dropped altogether, and two new contestants competed on each show.\n\nSee also\nPictionary\n Pictionary (1989 game show) - There was an early child version of Pictionary during the late 1980s, but with different rules.\n Pictionary (2022 game show) - The current version hosted by Jerry O'Connell, has its own rules different from both of its predecessors.\nWin, Lose or Draw, a similar game show also produced by Richard S.

{"text":"The Maratha Light Infantry is a light infantry regiment of the Indian Army. It traces its lineage to the Bombay Sepoys, raised in 1768, making it the most senior light infantry regiment in the Indian Army. The class composition of the regiment was and is primarily formed by Maratha recruits from the former Maratha Empire. The men are mostly drawn from all over the state of Maharashtra, with some percentage from Marathi-speaking areas of Karnataka including Coorg. The regimental centre has been in Belgaum, Karnataka, since 1922, which was part of the Bombay Presidency at that time. The battle cry of Maratha Light Infantry is, \"Bola Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jai (Say Victory To King Shivaji)\".\nMaratha regiment is the strongest regiment in India. \nThe regiment has won over 79 battle honours, including 25 in World War I.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-independence\n\nThe Marathas were a potent force in 16th, 17th, and 18th century India. Their military qualities were brilliantly optimised in their historic campaigns against the Mughals under the leadership of the Emperor  Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and succeeding Maratha rulers. Maratha armies, comprising both infantry and light cavalry, along with the Maratha Navy had dominated the military scene in India for three centuries. The 1st battalion of the regiment, known as Jangi Paltan (\"the fighting unit\"), was raised in August 1768 as the 2nd Battalion, Bombay Sepoys, to protect the British East India Company\u2019s possessions on the islands of Bombay.\n\nThe second battalion known as Kali Panchwin followed the next year as the 3rd Battalion, Bombay Sepoys. These two battalions were at the forefront of virtually every major engagement fought on the west coast from Surat to Cannanore during the last quarter of the 18th century. Prominent amongst these were the historic battles of Seedaseer and Seringapatam where in the words of Richard Wellesley their conduct and success were seldom equalled and never surpassed.\n\nThe turn of the 19th century was witness to the expansion of the regimental group with the raising of the 3rd battalion as the 2nd battalion, 5th (Travancore) Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry in 1797. The Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre was raised in March 1800 as the 2nd battalion, 7th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry; the 4th battalion in April 1800 as the 2nd battalion, 8th Regiment Bombay Infantry and the 5th battalion from the Bombay Fencibles as the 1st battalion, 9th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in December 1800.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the battalions fought in various campaigns from the Middle East to China. In recognition of the gallant conduct of its detachments at the siege of Kahun and the defence of Dadar, in Baluch territory during the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1841, the Kali Panchwin was created Light Infantry. Later, this honour was also bestowed on the 3rd and 10th Regiments of the Bombay Infantry (present 1st battalion, Maratha Light Infantry and 2nd battalion, Parachute Regiment respectively) for their gallantry in Sir Robert Napier\u2019s Abyssinian Campaign of 1867-1868. The regiment assumed the title 5th Mahratta Light Infantry in 1922.\n\nThree Maratha battalions distinguished themselves during the First World War (1914\u20131918) in the long drawn-out Mesopotamia campaign. The 117th Mahrattas (present 5th battalion, Maratha Light Infantry) was made into a Royal battalion for its conspicuously distinctive service during its campaign in Mesopotamia, particularly in the events leading to enemy capitulation after the bitter 146-day siege at Kut-el-Amara. The battalion was mostly composed of Marathas from the Khandesh region and Nashik district. For some unclear reasons even after winning, the regiment did not return to India. The 114th Mahrattas (present Regimental Centre) was awarded 28 gallantry awards for their performance in the battle of Sharquat, the highest earned by any unit in a single action. The other Maratha battalions, namely the 105th Mahratta Light Infantry, 110th Mahratta Light Infantry and 116th Mahrattas also acquitted themselves in Palestine and Mesopotamia.\n\nThe Second World War saw the Marathas in the forefront in almost every theatre of operations from the jungles of Southeast Asia to the deserts of North Africa, and the mountains and rivers of Italy. The war also saw the expansion of the regiment when thirteen new war service battalions were raised. Most of these were later demobilised after the war, whilst two were converted into artillery regiments. During the war Nk. Yeshwant Ghadge and Sep. Namdeo Jadhav were decorated with the Victoria Cross in the Italian campaign, while 130 other decorations were awarded to the regiment.\n\nApart from being the first light infantry battalion, of the Indian Army, Kali Panchwin was the first Indian battalion to participate in World War II, first to have lost its commanding officer in action (Col. Chitty at the battle of Jebel Hamrin, 1917) and the first Maratha battalion to participate in a United Nations mission. Later, it earned the Indian Army's first Ashoka Chakra in India's northeast.\n\nPost-independence\n\nIndian independence saw the regiment reverting to the original five battalions, with the 3rd Maratha Light Infantry converting to the airborne role and becoming the 2nd battalion, Parachute Regiment in April 1952. With the integration of the erstwhile princely states, the 19th, 20th, 22nd battalions were amalgamated, from the state forces of Satara, Kolhapur, Baroda, and Hyderabad, with the regiment. The expansion of the Indian Army to meet the omnipresent threat to its borders has seen the regiment grow to its present strength of 18 regular battalions and two Territorial Army battalions whilst the period also saw the conversion of the 21st battalion into the 21st battalion, Parachute Regiment (Special Forces) and the 115 Infantry Battalion (TA) being transferred to the Mahar Regiment.\n\nSince independence, battalions of the Maratha Light Infantry have taken part in every Indian armed conflict \u2014 the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Annexation of Junagadh, the Annexation of Hyderabad, the Annexation of Goa, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani wars of 1965 and 1971, against the Chinese on the Sikkim watershed in 1956, Operation Pawan, the ongoing operations on the Siachen Glacier and in numerous counter insurgency operations.\n\nThe Ashoka Chakra awarded to Capt. Eric Tucker, Col. N.J. Nair, Col. Vasanth Venugopal and Lt. Navdeep Singh, the five Maha Vir Chakras and the numerous other war and peacetime gallantry awards bear testimony to the front-line leadership and courage of the regiment's officers and soldiers.\n\nGen.

{"text":"John XI Bekkos (also, commonly, Beccus; name sometimes also spelled Veccus, Vekkos, or Beccos), (Greek: \u038a\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0399\u0391' \u0392\u03ad\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2; c. 1225 \u2013 March 1297) was Patriarch of Constantinople from June 2, 1275, to December 26, 1282, and the chief Greek advocate, in Byzantine times, of the reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches.\n\nLife\nJohn Bekkos was born in Nicaea among the exiles from Constantinople during the period of Latin occupation of that city, and died in prison in the fortress of St. Gregory near the entrance to the Gulf of Nicomedia. Our knowledge of Bekkos's life is derived from his own writings, from writings of Byzantine historians such as George Pachymeres and Nicephorus Gregoras, from writings against him by Gregory of Cyprus and others, and from defences of him by supporters of ecclesiastical union like Constantine Meliteniotes and George Metochites. Bekkos's history is closely bound up with the fortunes of the Union of the Churches declared at the Second Council of Lyon (1274), a union promoted by Pope Gregory X in the West and Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus in the East. The union policy of Michael VIII was largely politically motivated, and Bekkos at first opposed it; but, after Michael VIII had had him imprisoned in the Tower of Anemas for speaking out against it, Bekkos changed his mind (1273); a reading of such Greek church fathers as St. Basil the Great, St. Cyril of Alexandria and St. Epiphanius convinced Bekkos that theological differences between the Greek and Latin Churches had been exaggerated. After Patriarch Joseph I Galesiotes abdicated early in 1275 due to his opposition to the Council of Lyon, Bekkos was elected to replace him. His relationship with the emperor was sometimes stormy; although Michael VIII depended on Bekkos for maintaining his empire's peace with the West, he was annoyed by Bekkos's repeated intercessions on behalf of the poor. Michael was a crafty man, and knew how to make the Patriarch's life miserable by sundry small humiliations, until, in March, 1279, Bekkos quit in disgust, and had to be coaxed back to undertake the job again (August 6, 1279). The final years of Michael VIII's reign were entirely taken up with defending his empire against the threat posed by the Western king Charles of Anjou, and, in his anxiety to meet this threat, Michael enforced a \"reign of terror\" against opponents of union; but there is no convincing evidence that John Bekkos ever actively took part in or supported acts of violent persecution.\n\nAlthough earlier in his patriarchate Bekkos had promised not to reply to the pamphlets that were being circulated against the ecclesiastical union, by the latter years of Michael's reign he had changed his mind about this, and began \"holding numerous synods, calling all and sundry, and dug up books and published many others,\" defending the union on theological grounds, arguing the compatibility of the Latin doctrine with Greek patristic tradition. The effect of this was further to alienate most of the Greek clergy against him; it was this publishing activity that later served as the explicit grounds for the charges that were laid against him.\n\nThe ecclesial union engineered by Michael VIII was never popular in Byzantium, and, after his death (December 11, 1282), his son and successor, Andronicus II, repudiated it. On the day after Christmas, 1282, John Bekkos withdrew to a monastery; the former patriarch, Joseph I, was brought into the city on a stretcher, and a series of councils and public meetings ensued, led by a group of anti-unionist monks. Bekkos, in fear of violent death at the hands of a mob, was induced to sign a formal renunciation of his unionist opinions and of his priesthood (January, 1283), a renunciation which he afterwards disowned as extorted under duress, but which was used against him. After this, Bekkos spent some years under house arrest at a large monastery in Prusa in Asia Minor. From there, he began a literary campaign to exonerate himself, and succeeded in having a council called to reexamine his case; it took place at the imperial palace of Blachernae in Constantinople, meeting in several sessions from February to August in the year 1285. Although the Council of Blachernae reaffirmed Bekkos's earlier condemnation, in the council's aftermath Bekkos, by a series of writings, succeeded in bringing its dogmatic statement against him (the Tomus of 1285) into such disrepute that its principal author, the Patriarch Gregory II, resigned (1289). Bekkos saw this as vindicating his position. He spent the remaining years of his life in prison in the fortress of St. Gregory, revising his writings, maintaining friendly relations with the Emperor and prominent Byzantine churchmen, but unwilling to give up his unionist opinions; he died in 1297.\n\nThought\nThe basis of John Bekkos's quarrel with his contemporaries was a disagreement with them over the implications of a traditional patristic formula, that states that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son (in Greek, \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03a5\u1f31\u03bf\u1fe6). Already in the ninth century, this expression was being pushed in two different directions: Latin writers saw it as implying the Augustinian doctrine that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (Filioque); Greek writers, especially from the time of Patriarch Photios onward, saw it as consistent with the view that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone. Bekkos originally agreed with the Photian view, but his reading of the Greek fathers, and of medieval Greek writers like Nicephorus Blemmydes and Nicetas of Maroneia, caused him to change his mind. Much of John XI Bekkos's debate with Gregory II was a debate over the meaning of texts from St. Cyril and other fathers, whose wording (the Spirit \"exists from the Son\"; the Spirit \"fountains forth eternally\" from the Son, etc.) Bekkos saw as consistent with the Latin doctrine, while Gregory of Cyprus interpreted such texts as necessarily referring to an eternal manifestation of the Holy Spirit through or from the Son. This thirteenth-century debate has considerable relevance for current-day ecumenical discussions between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church.\n\nEditions\nMost of Bekkos's writings are found in vol. 141 of J.-P. Migne's Patrologia Graeca, although some still remain unedited. Migne reprints the seventeenth century editions of Leo Allatius; a more reliable re-edition was produced by H. Laemmer in the nineteenth century (Scriptorum Graeciae orthodoxae bibliotheca selecta, Freiburg, 1864), but even this edition lacks references for Bekkos's many patristic citations. Only a few, short writings of Bekkos's have received modern, critical editions. One of them is his work De pace ecclesiastica (\"On Ecclesiastical Peace\"), found in V. Laurent and J. Darrouz\u00e8s, Dossier Grec de l'Union de Lyon, 1273\u20131277 (Paris, 1976); in it, Bekkos criticizes the foundations of the schism between the Churches on historical grounds alone, pointing out that the Patriarch Photios only chose to launch a campaign against the Latin doctrine after his claim to be rightful Patriarch of Constantinople was rejected by Pope Nicholas I.\n\nSome of Bekkos's most important works are as follows:\n On the Union and Peace of the Churches of Old and New Rome (PG 141, 15\u2013157): this work summarizes Bekkos's main patristic arguments and rebuts the arguments of four Byzantine critics of Latin Christian theology (Photios, John Phurnes, Nicholas of Methone, Theophylact of Bulgaria).\n Epigraphs (PG 141, 613\u2013724): an anthology of patristic texts arranged under thirteen \"chapter headings,\" presenting a connected argument for the compatibility of the Greek and Latin doctrines of the procession of the Holy Spirit; 160 years later, it was instrumental in convincing Bessarion, at the Council of Florence, that the Latin doctrine was orthodox.\n Orations I and II On his own Deposition (PG 141, 949\u20131010): Bekkos's own account of events during the tumultuous synods of early 1283.\n De libris suis (\"On his own works\") (PG 141, 1019\u20131028): a short work, but essential for the critical history of Bekkos's texts. In it, Bekkos discusses the principles which governed his revision of his own works in an edition he wrote out by hand while he was in prison.\n Refutation of the 'Tome' of George of Cyprus (PG 141, 863\u2013923) and Four Books to Constantine Meliteniotes (PG 141, 337\u2013396): Bekkos's critique of his antagonist Gregory II.\n\nStudies\n Alexopoulos, Theodoros. \"The Filioque supporters of the 13th-century John Bekkos and Konstantin Melitiniotes and their relation to Augustin and Thomas Aquinas.\" Studia Patristica 68 (2013), 381\u2013395.\n Drew, Mark. \"Meanings, Not Words\": The Byzantine Apologia in Favour of the Filioque by Patriarch John XI Bekkos of Constantinople (c. 1225-1297) (doctoral thesis, Paris 2014).\n Gilbert, Peter. \"Not an Anthologist: John Bekkos as a Reader of the Fathers.\" Communio 36 (2009), 259\u2013294.\n Gill, Joseph. \"John Beccus, Patriarch of Constantinople, 1275\u20131282.\" Byzantina 7 (1975), 251\u2013266.\n Idem, Byzantium and the Papacy, 1198\u20131400 (New Brunswick, N.J., 1979).\n \n Kotzabassi, Sofia. \"The Testament of Patriarch John Bekkos.\" \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac 32 (2012), 25\u201336.\n \n Riebe, Alexandra.

{"text":"The Bratsberg Line () is a  railway line between Eidanger and Notodden in Vestfold og Telemark county, Norway. It opened in 1917, connecting the Tinnos Line, the S\u00f8rland Line and the Vestfold Line; allowing Norsk Hydro to transport fertilizer from their plant at Rjukan to the port in Skien. Since 1991 only passenger trains are operated, using Class 69 stock by Vy.\n\nThe railway is single track and features Norway's tallest railway bridge, Hjukse Bridge at . It is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration\n\nService \nVy operates three Class 69] EMUs between Notodden and Porsgrunn each hour.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\nThe need for a railway line from Notodden to Skien was driven forward by two key circumstances; the need for a railway to replace the Telemark Canal, and the construction of the S\u00f8rlandet Line.\n\nFrom the opening in 1909 Rjukan Salpeterfrabrik had transported their ammonia for shipment from Skien along the Rjukan Line, the Tinnsj\u00f8 railway ferry and the Tinnos Line to Notodden, where the ammonia was transferred from railway wagons to barges and shipped down  along the Telemark Canal to Skien. At the time many locals wanted to expand the canal instead of building a railway\u2014to allow ocean-going vessels to enter the port at Notodden and removing the need for transshipment in Skien. Plans were launched by Sigurd Kloumann in 1911, but rejected by the management of Norsk Hydro who preferred a continual railway line.\n\nThe S\u00f8rland Line (at the time called the Vestland Line) was intended to follow an inland route, and have several branch lines out to the most important cities\u2014including Skien and Notodden. At Skien Bratsbergbanen would connect to the Vestfold Line that continues to Porsgrunn and through Vestfold back to Drammen. The Bratsberg Line would run as part of the S\u00f8rland Line between Hjukseb\u00f8 to Nordagutu, branching off at those two stations.\n\nThere were two proposed routes, running on each side of the lake Norsj\u00f8. An eastern solution would be shorter and provide easier transport for Norsk Hydro, but would serve a smaller population that a western route; supporters of the eastern route pointed out that with a western route Notodden would be closer to Drammen than Skien\u2014a possible deteriorating effect on Telemark as a county. The western route would be 55\u00a0km, while the eastern routes would be 76\u00a0km via Gvarv and 94 via Lunde.\n\nNegotiations\nThe proposal for the Bratsberg Line was to incorporate the Tinnos Line, allowing seamless operations. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) negotiated with Norsk Transport, the Norsk Hydro subsidiary that operated the railways, and on 31 May 1913 they reached an agreement to create a company that would build the new railway and take over ownership of the Tinnos Line. Total equity would be NOK 16.5 million, where NSB would finance the whole new line while Norsk Transport would receive stocks of NOK 5.4 million\u2014half in preferred shares and half in common shares\u2014for the incorporation of the Tinnos Line and NOK 4.2 million was for the state financed part of the S\u00f8rland Line from Notodden to Nordagutu. Private investors would be allowed to sign shares for 5.9 million in preferred shares. As a result, NSB would have to guarantee a dividend of five percent to the private owners.\n\nIn parliament this was seen as a pure gift to foreign capital interests; the state would with the agreement have to insure the profits of the company to foreign investors, and a short section of the S\u00f8rland Line would be privately owned. Parliament instead suggested that NSB be given the preferred shares, and all new equity be signed by the state; now Norsk Transport would have to guarantee for the profits for the state. Budget exceeding would be covered by new shares sold to the state, and the company would build up a fund for the later expropriation of the line. The final decision to build the line was made by parliament on 25 July 1913. An agreement with Norsk Transport was made on 4 October 1913, which dictated that the Tinnos Line was transferred to the state from 1 July earlier the same year.\n\nConstruction\nConstruction started in 1913, with cost estimates at NOK 11.1 million; higher wages, inflation, lack of work force and geological difficulties around Skien pressed the final cost to NOK 21.9 million. The line was built with electric traction\u2014just like the Tinnos Line and the Rjukan Line. In Skien a controversy concerning the location of the new station arose; many locals claimed the station was too far out of the city and the stating was moved back to the old location in 1927. Porsgrunn patriots were hoping that the city would become the terminus, but instead the standard gauge track was extended to Eidanger; a critical point because it would become the transshipment point from narrow- to standard gauge.\n\nRegular traffic started 4 December 1916, but the official opening was not until 17 December 1917, with another official opening occurring on 9 February 1920 along with sections of the S\u00f8rland Line. The branch Brevik Line was completed on 16 June 1921, while the branch line to Her\u00f8ya was not completed until 1952.\n\nOperations\nOperation of the line was the responsibility of NSB, while the ownership remained in \u00d8st-Telemark Jernbaneaktieselskap; Norsk Hydro was forced to provide a five percent dividend to NSB\u2014money that was put into a fund to purchase Norsk Hydro's ownership at a later time. Norsk Transport retained ownership of the Rjukan Line and operated the railway ferries.\n\nThe passenger and general cargo transport on the line was not profitable, and Norsk Hydro had to subsidize this through higher fees on their freight. For NSB it was a profitable venture, as one of three lines to make profits in 1932. During the 1920s the two companies brought their disagreements to court; on 7 April 1923 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of NSB, and Norsk Hydro had to continue subsidizing operations.\n\nIn the period 1920\u201335, 6.1 million tonnes of cargo was transported for Norsk Hydro. During the first half of the 1930s the price of potassium nitrate fell 60%, and in 1934 Norsk Hydro announced they would move production; to compensate the state agreed to in part subsidize the transport on the railway. Still, on 6 April 1934 the plant at Notodden was closed and moved to Her\u00f8ya in Porsgrunn.\n\nThe disagreement between Norsk Hydro and NSB continued through the 1930s- and 40s until an agreement was reached in 1952 as to the value of each party in the line. On 1 July 1953 NSB bought Norsk Hydro's ownership in the line; the company remained a limited company until April 1956. A new agreement for transport fees was reached, giving Norsk Hydro a quantity discount, but falling production at Rjukan made it impossible for Norsk Hydro to take advantage of the potential discount.\n\nDecline\nFrom the 1960s the production at Rjukan decreased steadily, and the plant was finally closed on 1 July 1991; the last freight train was run four days later. Passenger transport from Porsgrunn to Tinnoset was terminated at the end of 1990, with 260 passengers taking the final train. Trains continued to operate to Notodden; except from October 2000 to August 2001. On 25 August 2004 the northern terminus at Notodden was moved by 800 m to a more central location; the extension is now electrified and reopened on the 14th of December 2020.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nJernbaneverket's list of stations on the Bratsberg Line \nJernbaneverket's list of stations on the Bratsberg Line (in English, but detail descriptions in Norwegian)\n\n \nRailway lines opened in 1916\nRailway lines in Vestfold og Telemark\nElectric railways in Norway\n1916 establishments in Norway","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79433}

It is widely considered to be one of the group's most accessible and popular songs. It reached No. 32 in the UK Singles Chart and was adopted as the Official Rock Song of Oklahoma from 2009 to April 2013. The song was ranked No. 31 on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Songs of the 2000s. It is also the band's most popular live song, and has rarely been excluded from setlists since its inception into their live shows in 2002. Wayne Coyne also considers it to be the best song they've ever written.\n\nStructure and recording\n\nIn an interview with Mojo, Coyne revealed that during the recording of Yoshimi..., band member Steven Drozd was trying to kick a heroin addiction.

However, on 23 April 2009, a vote in the Oklahoma House of Representatives fell three votes short of the 51 votes necessary to ratify the resolution: one Republican state legislator attacked the band for its use of offensive language, while another said he opposed the song because band member Michael Ivins had worn a red T-shirt with a yellow sickle and hammer during a previous appearance by the band. Democratic Governor Brad Henry subsequently announced that he would issue an executive order in lieu of the resolution rejected by the Oklahoma House.

He lost his life when his flagship, the light cruiser , was sunk by British battlecruisers commanded by Vice Admiral David Beatty.\n\nEarly life\nLeberecht Maass was born in Korkenhagen, Province of Pomerania. Maass entered the Kaiserliche Marine in 1863. Between 1893 and 1895 Maass commanded a torpedoboat. Between 1898 and 1901 he commanded a squadron and between 1903 and 1906 he was department chief in the Torpedo department. Maass served as director of the Naval School (1906-1908) and was promoted to captain in March 1908. He commanded the cruiser  (April 1908-June 1909), the armored cruiser  (March 1909-June 1910) and the old battleship  (August 1910-September 1910). In October 1910 Maass was promoted to kommandeur. On 9 December 1913 Maass was promoted to Konteradmiral, flying his flag on the cruiser C\u00f6ln. At the start of the First World War, Maass served as Leader of the torpedoboats and commander of the second scouting squadron.\n\nDeath at the Battle of Heligoland Bight\nOn 28 August 1914, the (British) Royal Navy's Harwich Force of two light cruisers,  and , and 31 destroyers and commanded by Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, made a raid on German ships near the German naval base at Heligoland. Providing distant cover were the battlecruisers  and  of Cruiser Force K under Rear-Admiral Moore.\n\nIn the early morning hours the Harwich Force encountered German torpedo boats on patrol west of Heligoland. The Germans quickly dispatched the light cruisers  and  to the scene, joined shortly afterwards by three more light cruisers out of Wilhelmshaven, including Rear Admiral Maass's flagship, K\u00f6ln, as well as  and . They were subsequently joined by yet another light cruiser, Mainz out of Emden. Tyrwhitt's Arethusa was severely damaged by Frauenlob, but the German cruiser also suffered heavy hits and retreated to Heligoland. Tyrwhitt soon received support from Commodore Goodenough's squadron of six modern Town class light cruisers: , , , ,  and . In the fog and smoke, Mainz found herself between Tyrwhitt's and Goodenough's forces and was sunk by them after a prolonged battle.\n\nCalled for assistance by Tyrwhitt, Admiral Beatty, whose First Battlecruiser Squadron of ,  and  had by then joined Moore's New Zealand and Invincible, arrived within little more than an hour at 12.40 p.m. and sank the hopelessly outgunned, but desperately resisting light cruisers C\u00f6ln and Ariadne.\n\nNamesake\nThe German navy named a World War II destroyer after Maass.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBattle of Heligoland Bight\n\n1863 births\n1914 deaths\nCaptains who went down with the ship\nPeople from Goleni\u00f3w County\nGerman military personnel killed in World War I\nImperial German Navy admirals of World War I\nPeople from the Province of Pomerania\nPeople lost at sea\nRecipients of the Order of the Sword\nCounter admirals of the Imperial German Navy","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79437}

{"text":"The Battle of Sirmium, Battle of Semlin or Battle of Zemun () was fought on July 8, 1167 between the Byzantine Empire (also known as Eastern Roman Empire), and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Byzantines achieved a decisive victory, forcing the Hungarians to sue for peace on Byzantine terms. The battle consolidated Byzantine control of the western Balkans.\n\nBackground\nFrom the mid 11th century, the Kingdom of Hungary had been expanding its territory and influence southwards, with a view to annexing the regions of Dalmatia and Croatia. This, and Hungarian alliances with the Serbian principalities, was the cause of tension with the Byzantine Empire, centred on Constantinople, which viewed Hungarian expansion as a potential threat to Byzantine dominance in the Balkans. The Byzantines and Hungarians launched a number of invasions of each other's territory, and the Byzantines regularly aided pretenders to the Hungarian throne. Friction and outbreaks of open warfare between the Byzantines and Hungarians reached a peak in the 1150s and 1160s.\n\nThe Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos attempted to achieve a diplomatic and dynastic settlement with the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1163, under the terms of an existing peace treaty, King Stephen III's younger brother B\u00e9la was sent to Constantinople to be raised under the personal tutelage of the emperor himself. As Manuel\u2019s relative (Manuel's mother was a Hungarian princess) and the fianc\u00e9 of his daughter, B\u00e9la became a Despotes (a title newly created for him) and in 1165 he was named as an heir to the throne, taking the name Alexios. Since he was also the heir to the Hungarian throne, a union between the two states was a distinct possibility. But in 1167, King Stephen refused to give Manuel control of the former Byzantine territories allocated to B\u00e9la-Alexios as his appanage; this directly led to the war that ended with the Battle of Sirmium.\n\nIn 1167, bad health prevented Manuel from taking to the field in person, therefore he appointed his nephew Andronikos Kontostephanos, the Megas Doux, to the command of his field army, with orders to bring the Hungarian army to battle.\n\nBattle\nDuring the early summer of 1167, the Byzantine army under Andronikos Kontostephanos managed to bring a large Hungarian force to battle near Sirmium. The most detailed surviving description of the battle was made by the Byzantine historian John Kinnamos.\n\nThe Byzantine army was composed of one-third foreign and two-thirds native units. According to John Kinnamos, involved in the battle were Turks, Cumans, Varangian Guard, Italian mercenary lancers from Lombardy, Serbian infantry and cavalry, German mercenaries, and even some Western mercenary knights.\nIt was arrayed in three divisions, as was the usual practice, at some distance from the river Sava, which was to the rear. The main battle line was shielded by a screen of horse archers \u2013 Turks and Cumans \u2013 and some western mercenary knights, who had made up the vanguard of the army. The centre, which had constituted the rearguard on the march, was commanded by Kontostephanos himself, and consisted of the imperial guards units, including the Varangians and Hetaireiai, units of Italian mercenaries from Lombardy (probably lancers) and an allied unit of 500 armoured Serbian infantry. Unusually, Kontostephanos also had the emperor's companions (the oikeoi or household troops) under his command. \n\nThe left wing, which had been the second division on the march, was composed of regular Byzantine and allied units arrayed in four taxiarchies or 'brigades' under Demetrios and George Branas, Tatikios Aspietes and Kogh Vasil. On the right \u2013 the third division on the march \u2013 were placed the elite Byzantine units and German mercenaries, together with some Turkish units. This division was commanded by the chartoularios Andronikos Lampardas and, probably, John Kontostephanos the brother of the megas doux. Close to each wing division, and following standard Byzantine practice, were placed units to cover the Byzantine flanks or to outflank the enemy and attack their rear should the opportunity arise (prokoursatores on the right flank and defensores on the left - from earlier military treatises). Three taxiarchies of infantry and archers, with a number of heavily armoured Turks (probably also infantry), were drawn up behind the centre in reserve.\n\nThe Hungarian commander, D\u00e9nes, count of B\u00e1cs (called Dionysios in Byzantine sources), drew his army, which included German allies, up in three divisions in a single broad battle line. Although the Byzantine sources say that he mixed infantry and cavalry without distinction, this most probably reflects a battle order with infantry drawn up in the centre and behind the cavalry, upon which the Hungarians clearly relied for the effectiveness of their attack. Choniates describes the Hungarian army as being composed of knights, archers and light infantry. Contemporary Hungarian armies often lacked infantry and Byzantine sources possibly referred to servants and other camp followers as infantry. The soldiers of the front rank of the Hungarian cavalry are described as being heavily armoured, and mounted on armoured horses.\n\nThe battle commenced with the Byzantine horse archers moving forward to skirmish with, and harry, the opposing lines and thereby goad them into mounting a charge, before which they were to retire. This was successful, and the whole Hungarian line surged forward. The Byzantine left wing, with the exception of the brigades led by Kogh Vasil and Tatikios, was immediately pushed back and broke, possibly in feigned flight, towards the river, where it quickly reformed. In the centre and on the Byzantine right, the Hungarian charge was held. The Byzantine right then counter-charged, and at the same time the regrouped Byzantine left-wing units also re-entered the conflict, attacking the Hungarians who were pinned by the two taxiarchies which had not withdrawn. Andronikos Lampardas then led an attack on the troops around the Hungarian commander and brought them to a halt; a deadly melee ensued with the Byzantine heavy cavalry resorting to the use of their fearsome iron maces. The battle had reached a decisive point. Kontostephanos, recognising the crisis of the battle, now deployed his remaining reserves. He counter-attacked in the centre and ordered forward the infantry along the whole front, driving the Hungarian forces back. The enemy divisions then began to break up in disorder and the whole Hungarian army turned to flight. \n\nThe Byzantines captured the main Hungarian standard, which was mounted on an oxen-drawn wagon similar to the Italian carroccio. Count D\u00e9nes's warhorse was also taken, though the Hungarian commander managed to escape. Many of the fleeing Hungarians were killed or captured by a Byzantine flotilla operating in the river that they needed to cross to get to safety. Five senior Hungarian commanders with the title \u017dupan were captured, along with 800 other soldiers. Over two thousand armours were taken from the dead and countless helmets, shields and swords. The following day the Byzantine army plundered their enemy's abandoned encampment.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Hungarians sued for peace on Byzantine terms and recognised the empire\u2019s control over Bosnia, Dalmatia, Croatia south of the Krka River as well as the Fru\u0161ka Gora. They also agreed to provide hostages for good behaviour; to pay Byzantium a tribute and supply troops when requested. The Battle of Sirmium completed Manuel's drive to secure his northern frontier.\n\nWhen Manuel's own son was born, B\u00e9la was deprived of the title despot and his position as heir to the imperial throne. In 1172, Stephen III died and B\u00e9la, with the help of Emperor Manuel, seized the throne of the Kingdom of Hungary. B\u00e9la had to swear that he would never harm Manuel and he remained loyal to the Empire until Manuel's death, but then he conquered or annexed lands previously held by the Byzantines.\n\nSee also\nKomnenian army\nSiege of Brani\u010devo (1154)\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\n \n\nConflicts in 1167\n1167 in Europe\n12th century in Serbia\nBattles involving the Byzantine Empire\nBattles involving Hungary in the Middle Ages\nBattles involving Serbia in the Middle Ages\nKomnenos dynasty\nHistory of Syrmia\nSremska Mitrovica\n1160s in the Byzantine Empire\nMedieval history of Vojvodina\nBattles involving the Varangian Guard","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79440}

{"text":"Carlo Maratta or Maratti (13 May 162515 December 1713) was an Italian painter, active mostly in Rome, and known principally for his classicizing paintings executed in a Late Baroque Classical manner. Although he is part of the classical tradition stemming from Raphael, he was not exempt from the influence of Baroque painting and particularly in his use of colour. His contemporary and friend, Giovanni Bellori, wrote an early biography on Maratta.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Camerano (Marche), then part of the Papal States, Maratta went to Rome in 1636, accompanied by, Don Corintio Benicampi, secretary to Taddeo Barberini. He became an apprentice in the studio of Andrea Sacchi. It was at this time that the debate between Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona took place at the Accademia di San Luca, the artists academy in Rome. Sacchi argued that paintings should only have a few figures which should express the narrative whereas Cortona countered that a greater number of figures allowed for the development of sub themes. Maratta's painting at this time was closely allied with the classicism of Sacchi and was far more restrained and composed than the Baroque exuberance of Pietro da Cortona\u2019s paintings. Like Sacchi, his paintings were inspired by the works of the great painters from Parma and Bologna: Annibale Carracci, Guercino, Guido Reni, Francesco Albani, and Giovanni Lanfranco.\n\nHe developed a close relationship with Sacchi till the death of his master in 1661. His fresco of  'Constantine ordering the Destruction of Pagan Idols' (1648) for the Baptistery of the Lateran, based on designs by Sacchi, gained him attention as an artist but his first prominent independent work was the 'Adoration of the Shepherds' (1650) for San Giuseppe di  Falegnami. Another major work from this period was 'The Mystery of the Trinity Revealed to St. Augustine' (c. 1655) painted for the church of Santa Maria dei Sette Dolori. \n \nPope Alexander VII (reigned 1655\u20131667) commissioned many paintings from him including The Visitation  (1656) for Santa Maria della Pace and the Nativity in the gallery of the Quirinal Palace where he worked under the direction of Cortona who selected him for this task.  His pictures of the late 1650s exhibit light and movement derived from Roman Baroque painting, combined with classical idealism. \n\nFrom 1660, he built up a private client base amongst wealthy patrons of Europe,  establishing  the most prominent art studio in Rome of his time and, after the death of Bernini in 1680, he became the leading artist in Rome. In 1664, Maratta became the director of the Accademia di San Luca and, concerned with elevating the status of artists, promoted the study and drawing of the art of Classical Antiquity. During the 1670s he was commissioned by  Pope Clement X to fresco the ceiling of the salone in the Palazzo Altieri; the iconographic programme for The Triumph of Clemency was devised by Bellori. Unlike Giovan Battista Gaulli\u2019s nave fresco in the nearby church of the Gesu which was being painted at the same time, Maratta did not employ illusionism; his scene remained within its frame and used few figures.\n\nHis major works of this period included:  The Appearance of the Virgin to St. Philip Neri (c. 1675) now in the Pitti Palace in Florence; The Virgin with Saints Carlo Borromeo and Ignatius of Loyola, and Angels (c. 1685) for the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella (c. 1675); and The Assumption of the Virgin with Doctors of the Church (1686) for the Cybo Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo.  It was not, as his critics claimed, numerous depictions of the Virgin that earned him the nickname Carluccio delle Madonne  or \u2018Little Carlo of the Madonnas', but his gifted interpretation of this theme.  Other works included an altarpiece, The Death of St Francis Xavier  (1674\u201379) in the San Francesco Xavier Chapel in the right transept of the Church of the Gesu.\n\nMaratta was a well-known portrait painter. He painted Sacchi (c. 1655, Prado), Cardinal Antonio Barberini (c. 1660 Palazzo Barberini), Pope Clement IX (1669, Vatican Pinacoteca) and a self-portrait (c. 1695, Brussels). He also painted numerous English sitters during their visits to Rome on the Grand Tour, having sketched antiquities for John Evelyn as early as 1645.\n\nIn 1679 or 1680, a daughter, Faustina, was born to Maratta by his mistress, Francesca Gommi (or Gomma). He legally recognized her as his daughter in 1698 and upon becoming a widower in 1700, Maratta married the girl's mother. His daughter's features were incorporated into a number of Maratta's late paintings.\n \nIn 1704, Maratta was knighted by Pope Clement XI.\n \nWith a general decline in patronage around the beginning of the eighteenth century and largely due to the economic downturn, Maratta turned his hand to painting restoration, including works by Raphael and Carracci.  His sculptural designs included figures of the Apostles for San Giovanni in Laterano. He continued to run his studio into old age even when he could no longer paint. Maratta died in 1713 in Rome, and was buried there in Santa Maria degli Angeli.\n\nSee also\nList of Carlo Maratta pupils and assistants\n\nPartial anthology of works\n\nBirth of the Virgin, 1643\u20131645, Church of Saint Clare, Nocera Umbra.\nJuno Beseeching Aeolus to Release the Winds Against the Trojan Fleet, 1654\u20131656, Ackland Art Museum, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe Triumph of Clemency, 1673\u20131675, Palazzo Altieri, Rome.\nThe Virgin and Child in Glory, c.1680, Spanish Royal Collection, National Museum, Madrid\nSt John the Baptist Explaining the Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception to Sts Gregory, Augustine, and John Chrysostom, 1686, Cybo Chapel, Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome.\nPortrait of Clement IX Rospigliosi, 1669, Pinacoteca Gallery, Vatican Museums, Rome.\nSaint Joseph and the Infant Christ, Dunedin Public Art Gallery, Dunedin.\nAssumption of an Enthroned Virgin, Santa Maria in Vepretis, San Ginesio\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n National gallery (UK) web site entry for Carlo Maratta (accessed May 2013)\n WGA site and gallery\n\n1625 births\n1713 deaths\nPeople from the Province of Ancona\n17th-century Italian painters\nItalian male painters\n18th-century Italian painters\nItalian Baroque painters\nCatholic painters\n18th-century Italian male artists","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79443}
{"text":"Stephen Robert Jordan (born 6 March 1982) is an English former footballer and team physiotherapist at League Two side Salford City.\n\nAs a player he was a defender and notably played in the Premier League for Manchester City where he was part of the first team squad from 1999 until 2007. He went on to play for Burnley, Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town and Fleetwood Town amongst others. He retired in 2019 after three seasons playing with non-league side Chorley.\n\nCareer\n\nManchester City\nBorn in Warrington, Jordan grew up as a Manchester City fan and joined their youth development system as an eight-year-old. In 2000, he became part of the youth academy going on to sign for the first team 2 years later.\n\nDuring his first two seasons at Manchester City, Jordan failed to make any first team starts and as a result was loaned out to then Football League Two side Cambridge United in October 2002 for 3 months. He made his debut for the club on the same day, playing the full ninety minutes of a 2\u20132 draw with Wrexham at the Abbey Stadium. He went on to make a total of 11 appearances with the side and returned to Manchester in January 2003. He made his first team debut for Manchester City in the same year coming on as a late substitute against Bolton Wanderers at the start of April.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Peterborough United made an offer for Jordan who was out of contract at Manchester City, as he was under 24 at the time Peterborough would have been required to pay compensation to Manchester City under the Bosman ruling. Kevin Keegan, the then City boss, said that he hoped Jordan would sign a new contract and remain with the club. A fortnight later City revealed that Jordan had signed a 12-month extension to his contract and would remain at the club until 2005. Peterborough then contacted Manchester City with the hope of loaning the player as cover for their injured defender Sagi Burton, Keegan agreed to the loan but Jordan did not want to go as he felt he was close to breaking into the first team at City.\n\nThe following season Jordan did break into the first team, making 19 Premier League starts in the later stages of the season and as the player was only on a 12-month contract his new manager, Stuart Pearce urged the player to \"commit his future\" to the club. Jordan finally committed his future to the club at the end of May 2005 when he signed a two-year-long contract with City. However, over the next two seasons at City, Jordan made fewer and fewer appearances, starting just 30 league games, and was released when his contract expired in 2007.\n\nBurnley\nIn July 2007 it was announced that Burnley of the Football Championship had signed Jordan on a 3-year deal.\nIn May 2010, Jordan was released by Burnley after three injury-filled seasons with the club.\n\nSheffield United\nFollowing his release, Jordan had a trial with Portsmouth even joining them on their US pre-season tour, but he decided against a move to Fratton Park in favour of joining Sheffield United on a one-year contract. Jordan continued to be prone to injuries throughout the following season and failed to cement himself in a struggling Blades side. After being told by recently appointed Blades boss Micky Adams that he was not in his long-term plans, Jordan joined Huddersfield Town on an emergency one-month loan in February 2011, following injuries to their regular left-backs Gary Naysmith and Liam Ridehalgh. He made his d\u00e9but the same day in Town's 2\u20132 draw with Leyton Orient at the Galpharm Stadium. He would make 5 further appearances for the Terriers before returning to Sheffield in March, after Naysmith and Ridehalgh had returned to the squad. With no prospect of further first team football at Bramall Lane his contract with Sheffield United was terminated by mutual consent on at the start of April 2011 after playing only 15 times for the South Yorkshire club.\n\nRochdale\nAfter a trial with League Two side Rotherham United, Stephen Jordan joined League One side Rochdale on non-contract terms on 28 October 2011. He played in every game and thank the club for not only giving him another chance of enjoying playing football at the minute, but also signing him in the place. It went even better for Jordan as he was rewarded with a permanent 18-month deal at the club on 22 December 2011. After signing a new contract, Jordan continued to play in the first team, though his first team place was soon reduced, having been on the bench. On 10 March 2012, Jordan performance in a 2\u20132 draw against Huddersfield Town was praised by Manager John Coleman, commenting \"ran himself into the ground until he could run no more.\" He since made no appearance for the remainder of the 2011\u201312 season and it went worse as the club was relegated to League Two.\n\nAt the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Jordan was released by Rochdale on 27 July 2012.\n\nDunfermline Athletic\nJordan joined Scottish Premier League recent relegated side Dunfermline Athletic, having joined the club on trial.

{"text":"Yane Ivanov Sandanski (, ) (originally spelled in older Bulgarian orthography ) (18 May 1872 \u2013 22 April 1915), was a Macedonian Bulgarian revolutionary. He is recognized as a national hero in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia. \n\nIn his youth Sandanski was interested in Bulgarian politics and had a career as head of the local prison in Dupnitsa. Then he was involved in the anti-Ottoman struggle, joining initially the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC), but later switched to the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organisation (IMARO). Sandanski became one of the leaders of the IMARO in the Serres revolutionary district and head of the left wing of the organisation. He supported the idea of a Balkan Federation, and Macedonia as an autonomous state within its framework, as an ultimate solution of the national problems in the area. During the Second Constitutional Era he became an Ottoman politician and entrepreneur, collaborating with the Young Turks and founded the Bulgarian People's Federative Party. Sandanski took up arms on the side of Bulgaria during the Balkan Wars (1912\u201313). Finally he was involved in Bulgarian public life again, but was eventually killed by the rivalling IMARO right-wing faction activists.\n\nSandanski's legacy remains disputed among Bulgarian and Macedonian historiography today. Macedonian historians refer to him in an attempt to demonstrate the existence of Macedonian nationalism or at least proto-nationalism within a part of the local revolutionary movement at his time. Despite the allegedly \"anti-Bulgarian\" autonomism and federalism of Sandanski, it is unlikely he had developed Macedonian national identity in a narrow sens\u0435, or he regarded the Bulgarian Exarchists in Ottoman Macedonia as a separate nation from Bulgarians. Contrary to the assertions of Skopje, his \"separatism\" represented a supranational project, not national. More, the compatriots, who convinced Sandanski to accept such leftist ideas, were Bulgarian socialists, most of whom were non-Macedonian in origin. The designation Macedonian then was an umbrella term covering different nationalities in the area and when applied to the Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia, it denoted mainly the then Bulgarian ethnic community there. However, contrary to Bulgarian assertions, his ideas of a separate Macedonian political entity, have stimulated the subsequent development of Macedonian nationalism.\n\nAs initial member of the SMAC, which served directly the Bulgarian governmental interests, and then of the left wing of the IMRO, which advocated the creation of a Balkan Federation, Yane Sandanski remains one of the most controversial Bulgarian revolutionaries. While the Bulgarian communist authorities mostly liked him for his leftist sympathies, after the fall of communism he is described by some nationalist historians as a betrayer of the Bulgarian national interests in Macedonia. Sandanski is portrayed by them as an Ottomanist, and collaborationist of the Young Turks, seen as Bulgarian enemies, and as the man who started the fratricidal war into the IMRO. He has been accused also of being transformed himself from a revolutionary into a businessperson whose political motivation became only the money earning. On the contrary, in North Macedonia, the positive connotation of him, created in the times of Communist Yugoslavia is still alive. Since then the Macedonian historiography has emphasized the particularity of the IMRO's left wing, while in fact Yugoslav communism and Macedonian nationalism are closely related. Thus, he is portrayed by the Macedonian historians as a freedom fighter against the \u201cGreater Bulgarian chauvinism\u201d and the \u201cTurkish yoke\u201d.  Sandanski has been also claimed recently by some Aromanians as an alleged compatriot, who sought only a limited autonomy for Macedonia in a business deal with the Ottoman Turks.\n\nBiography \nSandanski was born on 18 May 1872 in the village of Vlahi, near Kresna, then in the Ottoman Empire. His father Ivan participated in the Kresna\u2013Razlog Uprising as a standard-bearer. In 1879, after the crush of the uprising, his family moved to Dupnitsa, in the recently established Principality of Bulgaria, where Sandanski received his elementary education. From 1892 to 1894 he was a soldier in the Bulgarian Army. Sandanski was an active supporter of Radoslavov's wing of the Liberal Party and shortly after it came to power in February 1899, he was appointed head of the Dupnitsa prison. Because of that, his name \"Sandanski\" distorted from \"Zindanski\" that comes from Turkish \"Zindanc\u0131\" (lit. Dungeon Keeper or Jailer). \nYane Sandanski was involved in the Revolutionary Movement in Macedonia and Thrace and became one of its leaders. He joined initially the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee (SMAC) in 1895 during the Committee's cheta action into the Pomaks-inhabited regions of the Western Rhodopes. In 1897 in Dupnitsa, a new detachment of the Supreme Committee was formed, under the leadership of Krastyo Zahariev, where Sandanski joined too. After the detachment entered Pirin Mountains, it encountered Ottoman troops. In one of the battles Sandanski was wounded and his older brother Todor, who was also in this detachment, returned him to Bulgaria for treatment. In the next years, Sandanski was a SMAC activist in the Pirin region, but in 1900 returned to become a director of the local prison in Dupnitsa. In 1901, Sandanski switched to the Internal Macedono-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Organization (IMARO). He built up the organization\u2019s network of committees in the districts of Serres and Gorna Dzhumaja in the Pirin region, and that is why the people gave him the nickname \"Pirin Tsar\" (Pirinski Tsar). He was also one from the organizers of the Miss Stone Affair - America's first modern hostage crisis. On September 3, 1901, a Protestant missionary named Ellen Stone set out on horseback across the mountainous hinterlands of Macedonia and was ambushed by a band of armed revolutionaries. Sandanski was also active in the anti-Ottoman Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising. The Militias active in the region of Serres, led by Yane Sandanski and an insurgent detachment of the Macedonian Supreme Committee, held down a large Turkish force. These actions began on the day of the Feast of the Cross and did not involve the local population as much as in other regions, but were well to the east of Monastir and to the west of Thrace.\n\nThe failure of the Ilinden insurrection resulted in the eventual split of the IMARO into a left (federalist) faction in the Seres and Strumica districts and a right-wing faction (centralists) in the Bitola, Salonica and Uskub districts. The left-wing faction opposed Bulgarian nationalism and advocated the creation of a Balkan Socialist Federation with equality for all subjects and nationalities. The centralist faction of IMARO, moved towards Bulgarian nationalism as its regions became incursed of Serb and Greek armed bands, which started infiltrating Macedonia after 1903. The years 1905\u20131907 saw the split between the two factions, when in 1907 Todor Panitsa killed the right-wing activists Boris Sarafov and Ivan Garvanov in order of Sandanski. The Kjustendil congress of the right faction of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) in 1908, sentenced Sandanski to death, and led to a final disintegration of the organization.\n\nAfter the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 and during the Second Constitutional Era Sandanski (in association with Hristo Chernopeev, Chudomir Kantardziev, Aleksandar Buynov and others) contacted the Young Turks and started legal operation. After the disintegration of IMARO, they tried to set up the Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (MORO). Later, the congress for MORO's official inauguration failed and Sandanski and Chernopeev started to work towards a creation of one of the left political parties in the Ottoman Empire \u2013 People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section), whose headquarters was in Solun. This federalist project was supposed to include different ethnic sections in itself, but this idea failed and the only section that was created was the faction of Sandanski, called Bulgarian section. In this way its activists only \"revived\" their Bulgarian national identification, as Sandanski's faction advocated the particular interests of the \"Bulgarian nationality\" in the Empire. In 1909 the group around Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the rally of the Young Turks to Istanbul that led to the deposition of sultan Abdul Hamid II from the throne. Sandanski dreamed about the creation of a Balkan Federative Republic according to the plans of the Balkan Socialist Federation and Macedonia as a part of that Federation. He demanded that the IMARO should embrace all nationalities in the region, not only Bulgarians.\n\nIn this way it would be possible to create a healthy system aimed at the organisation of a mass uprising. Later Sandanski and his faction actively supported the Bulgarian army in the Balkan wars of 1912\u20131913, initially with the idea, that their duty is to fight for autonomous Macedonia,  but later fighting for Bulgaria.   \u039fbserving the atrocity of Serbs over the local population, former IMRO members began restoration of the organizational network. In the same period a group around Petar Chaulev began negotiations with the Albanian revolutionaries. The temporary Albanian government proposed to them a common revolt to be organized and risen. The negotiations from the part of the Organization had to be carried by Petar Chaulev. The Bulgarian government believed however, that it would not come to a new war with Serbia, so it did not attend the negotiations. However, later, in June 1913 the Bulgarian government sent in Tirana Yane Sandanski for new negotiations. He gave an interview for the Italian newspaper \"Il Secolo\", where he said that he came to agreement with the Albanians and that from the Bulgarian side there would be organized bands and assaults. So he helped the preparation of the Ohrid-Debar Uprising, organised jointly by IMRO and the Albanians of Western Macedonia. After the wars, Pirin Macedonia was ceded in 1913 to Bulgaria and Sandanski resettled again in the Kingdom where he was killed in 1915 by his political opponents.\n\nControversy \nThe Macedonian liberation movement consisted of three major factions. Led by his excessive ambitions, Sandanski came into conflict with the majority\u00a0\u2014 the Centralists in IMARO and the Varhovists. Although initially a member of the Bulgarian nationalistic Varhovists band, later Yane Sandanski and his Serres group (the Federalists) proclaimed a fight for an autonomous Macedonia which was to be included in a Balkan Socialist Federation. In this manner, the policy of Sofia was completely identified to the adversary character of Athens and Belgrade. The activists of Serres nonetheless stipulated that the Macedonian Question could not be resolved if it is formulated as a part of a Bulgarian national question.  After the Ilinden Uprising, this Group insisted on cooperation with all ethnic and religious groups in the Ottoman Empire and envisioned the inclusion of Macedonia and the district of Adrianople in a Balkan Federation. However the idea of Macedonian autonomy was strictly political and did not imply a secession from Bulgarian ethnicity, even as it was seen at a later stage of the struggle by the group around Sandanski, that espoused a number of classical liberal ideas intermingled with socialism, imported from Bulgaria.\n\nOn the other hand, the bigger fraction (the Centralists), as well as that of the other revolutionary organization - Macedonian Supreme Committee - Varhovists, (most of which followers joined the \"Centralists\", after its dissolution in 1903) aimed also at autonomy. But they did not expected inclusion in a Balkan Socialist Federation and had not so extreme policy by their relation to Sofia. These political differences led to sharp conflict between them.\n\nArguably Sandanski's greatest sin in the context of the whole movement were the assassinations of the vojvod Michail Daev and later of Ivan Garvanov and Boris Sarafov, both members of the IMARO's Central Committee. He came to regret these and other murders later. Because of that he was even sentenced to death by the Centralists. The Bulgarian authorities investigated the assassinations and suspected Sandanski was the main force behind them. On the other hand, he was amnestied by the Bulgarian Parliament after the support he gave to the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan wars. \n\nThere was, a long history of friction between the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Organization, since those more closely connected with the Exarchate were moderates rather than revolutionaries. Thus the two bodies had never been able to see eye to eye on a number of important issues touching the  population in Thrace and Macedonia. In his regular reports to the Exarch, the Bulgarian bishop in Melnik usually referred to Yane as the wild beast and deliberately spelt his name without capital letters. Despite being an extreme leftist, he had never rejected the Bulgarian Exarchate as an institution, or denied that it had a role to play in the life of the Macedonian Bulgarians. Sandanski also collaborated later with the Young Turks, opposing other factions of IMARO, which fought against the Ottoman authorities in this period.\n \n\nDuring the first days of Young Turk Revolution, the collaboration of the Macedonian leftists with the Ottoman activists was stated in a special Manifesto to all the nationalities of the Empire. The loyalty to the Empire declared by Sandanski deliberately blurred the distinction between Macedonian and Ottoman political agenda. This ideological transition was quite smooth as long as the rhetoric of Macedonian autonomist supra-nationalism was already quite close to the Ottomanist idea of the so-called unity of the elements. During the honeymoon of Serres revolutionaries and Ottoman authorities, it was the internationalist ideas of Bulgarian socialist activists that left their stamp on Sandanski's agenda: what was seen as national interests had to be subdued to the pan-Ottoman ones in order to achieve a supra-national union of all the nationalities within a reformed Empire. After Bulgaria lost the Balkan Wars and as result most of Macedonia was ceded to Greece and Serbia, Sandanski attempted to organize the assassination of Bulgarian Tsar Ferdinand I, but it failed. He and his wing officially supported then the Russophiles from the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Centralists organised several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Sandanski. They came closest to achieving their goal in Thessaloniki, where Tane Nikolov managed to kill two other Federalists and heavily wounded Sandanski. Eventually, Sandanski was killed near the Rozhen Monastery on April 22, 1915, while travelling from Melnik to Nevrokop, by local IMARO activists.\n\nLegacy \n\nWhile Sandanski's legacy remains disputed among Bulgarian and Macedonian historiography, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile his conflicting and controversial activity. According to the Turkish professor of history Mehmet Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu, who is interested  in nation-building in the late Ottoman Empire, it is very difficult to find a definitive answers to some ticklish questions related to Sandanski's biography. Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu's opinion is that Sandanski was de facto a betrayer of the national Bulgarian interests in Macedonia, collaborating with the Young Turks, supporting the idea of the autonomy of the region into the Ottoman Empire, and opposing its incorporation into Bulgaria. That would allow him to maintain his political role, as one of the native leaders in the region. However, this does not mean, he regarded the Bulgarian Macedonian population as a separate Macedonian nation. Also, all the main ideologists, who indoctrinated Sandanski with these leftist ideas, were socialists from Bulgaria proper. Mercia MacDermott who is author of a biographical book on Sandanski, has admitted she has had a real battle over such controversial figure. Nevertheless, she has described him as Bulgarian revolutionary, who under the influence of leftist ideas, tried to solve the Macedonian Question by uniting all the Balkan peoples. \n\nAs a whole, during the early 20th century the idea of a separate Macedonian identity was promoted only by small circles of intellectuals, but the majority of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves to be Bulgarians. The turn-of-the-century Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, was in fact a largely pro-Bulgarian oriented and its members had ethnic Bulgarian identity, including Sandaski.\n\nThe IMRO right-wing publicist Hristo Silyanov provides a position of Sandanski\u2019s where he states that the solution of the Macedonian question is not the unity with Bulgarians, and that the Macedonian population had to emancipate itself as a self-determining (or an independent) people. However Siljanov described all IMARO revolutionaries as Bulgarians and used the term Macedonian only as regional designation.\n\nIn North Macedonia Sandanski is considered a national hero and one of the most prominent revolutionary figures of the 20th century. However some Macedonian mainstream specialists on the history of local revolutionary movement, like Academician Ivan Katard\u017eiev and PhD. Zoran Todorovski, argue that the political separatism of Sandanski represented a form of early Macedonian nationalism, asserting that at that time it was only a political phenomenon, without ethnic character. Both define all Macedonian revolutionaries from that period as Bulgarians, as products of the Bulgarian educational system, Bulgarian Army military training and Bulgarian Church spiritual impact, which had a policy of producing \u201cBulgarian national consciousness\u201d. According to them Macedonian identity arose mostly after the First World War and Sandanski identified himself as Bulgarian too. Dimitrija \u010cupovski under the pseudonym Strezo writes that Sandanski was a Bulgarian agent, bodyguard of the Bulgarian prince and an ordinary criminal.\n\nThe IMRO right-wing publicist Stoyan Boyadziev has described Sandanski as extremely controversial Bulgarian revolutionary, whose separatist \u0430\u0441tivit\u0443 however, produced as a whole Macedonian nationalism. Today, Sandanski is one of the names mentioned in the National anthem of North Macedonia. In Bulgaria the communist regime appreciated Sandanski because of his socialist ideas and honoured him by renaming the town Sveti Vrach to Sandanski, in 1949. In the years after the Fall of Communism some right-wing Bulgarian historians have been keen to discredit his reputation. Sandanski Point on the E coast of Ioannes Paulus II Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica was named after him by the Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Mercia MacDermott.

{"text":"Roy Allen Thomas (March 24, 1874 \u2013 November 20, 1959) was a center fielder in Major League Baseball. From 1899 through 1911, he played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1899\u20131908, 1910\u20131911), Pittsburgh Pirates (1908) and Boston Doves (1909). Thomas batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.  Thomas was the brother of fellow Major Leaguer, Bill Thomas.\n\nAccording to baseball analyst Bill James, Thomas is the only major league regular to have scored three times as many runs as he drove in. In 1470 games played, Thomas compiled 1011 runs scored and 299 runs batted in, as he posted a .290 batting average with a .413 on-base average and 244 stolen bases. \n \nDuring his 13-season career, Thomas was one of the most productive table-setters in the National League. His relentless patience at the plate infuriated opposing pitchers and prompted the NL to change its rule regarding foul balls in . The new rule also was adopted by the American League two years later. He is, in fact, reported by James to hold the unofficial consecutive foul-ball record \u2013 22, in one plate appearance.\n\n Thomas batted .325 in his rookie year with a .457 OBP via 115 walks, immediately establishing himself as the Philadelphia Phillies' leadoff hitter and center fielder. At the time foul balls were not counted as strikes, and Thomas, who became adept at fouling off good pitches, worked an astonishing number of 230 walks in his first two seasons. Ironically the rule-change had little effect on Thomas. After the new rule went into effect, he led the NL in walks six out of the next seven seasons (1901\u201304, 1906\u201307).\n\nThomas was sent to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1908 midseason. He also played for the Boston Doves in 1909, returning to the Phillies for the 1910\u201311 seasons. At his retirement, he held career fielding records for center fielders in putouts (NL) and fielding average (MLB). Thomas left a playing record that has endured. He ranks 20th all-time in walk percentage (.164), 29th all-time in on-base percentage (.412) and 84th all-time in walks (1,042).\n\nThomas became a coach with the University of Pennsylvania baseball team in 1909, and continued playing in the majors while coaching for three seasons. From 1909 to 1919, he compiled a record of 106\u201343\u20133 for a .632 winning percentage, comparable to the best college coaches of all time.\n\nThomas died in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at age 85, and was buried in the nearby Riverside Cemetery.\n\nSee also\n List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders\n List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders\n List of St. Louis Cardinals coaches\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\n1874 births\n1959 deaths\n19th-century baseball players\nMajor League Baseball center fielders\nBoston Doves players\nHouston Buffaloes managers\nPhiladelphia Phillies players\nPittsburgh Pirates players\nHaverford Fords baseball coaches\nPenn Quakers baseball coaches\nPenn Quakers baseball players\nPeople from Norristown, Pennsylvania\nSportspeople from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania\nBaseball players from Pennsylvania","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79448}

{"text":"\"Bad Boys\" is a song by English pop duo Wham! which was a hit in 1983. It was written and co-produced by George Michael, one half of the duo, and released on Innervision Records.\n\nThe song was an energetic but endearing tale of a rebellious teenage lad's struggle against his parents who are concerned about his late-night activities. Although George wrote and sang it from the teenager's perspective (he was himself only 19 when he composed it and the character refers to being that age in the song), he also penned a middle eight in which the \"parents\" (George putting on more \"adult\" voices) aired their concerns, which included late nights and cigarettes and ultimately asking, \"Why do you have to be so cruel?\". George's father was played by Anthony Souter who was 18 and made up to look older.\n\nChart performance\nIt was the third single to be taken from Wham!'s debut album, Fantastic, and reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart, going on to become the 26th best selling single of 1983. At the time, Wham! was projecting a hard, politically motivated image, with \"Bad Boys\" one of a number of songs projecting a stance of mood and youthful independence, a \"soul boy \u2013 dole boy\" theme.  The single was also released in the United States, peaking at number 60. It was the duo's first time on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, although they were listed as Wham!-UK.\n\n\"Bad Boys\" became the biggest hit from the debut album, although it would be usurped by \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" from the album Make It Big in 1984, which became the first of four UK number-one singles the duo would enjoy. George quickly denounced \"Bad Boys\" as a song he hated, stating it was \"like an albatross round my neck\". The song was famously omitted from the 1997 compilation album The Best of Wham!: If You Were There..., despite the album including tracks that were not released as singles.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences\n\n1983 songs\n1983 singles\nWham! songs\nSongs written by George Michael\nSong recordings produced by George Michael\nCBS Records singles\nInnervision Records singles\nSongs about teenagers","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79453}
{"text":"The pale-billed flowerpecker or Tickell's flowerpecker (Dicaeum erythrorhynchos) is a tiny bird that feeds on nectar and berries, found in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and western Myanmar. The bird is common especially in urban gardens with berry bearing trees. They have a rapid chipping call and the pinkish curved beak separates it from other species in the region.\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a tiny bird, 8\u00a0cm long, and is one of the smallest birds occurring in most parts of southern India and Sri Lanka. The bird is plain brownish to olive green. The underside is buff olive and does not contrast greatly with the upperparts and not whitish as in the Nilgiri flowerpecker of the Western Ghats and Nilgiri hills nor is it streaked as in the thick-billed flowerpecker. The Nilgiri flowerpecker has a pale supercilium unlike this species which has no marking on the head. The Sri Lankan race ceylonense Babault, 1920 - is greyer and smaller than the nominate race of peninsular India. It has been considered one of the early flowerpeckers, originating in the Malay Peninsula, to colonize the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nIn forested areas, they often visit the flowers of Loranthus (=Dendrophthoe) and Viscum species, the seeds of which are dispersed mainly by this and other flowerpecker species. The berries of these epiphytic parasites are usually swallowed whole (they sometimes pinch fruits and discard the seeds while feeding on the pulp but this technique is more often used by the syntopic thick-billed flowerpecker) and the seeds are voided after a rapid passage through their gut in about three to four minutes. The voided seed has a sticky coating and the bird applies its vent to the surface of a suitable perch and may turn around so as to get rid of the seed, which then sticks onto the branch where it may subsequently germinate. The flowers of Dendrophthoe falcata are pollinated by this species. The flower bud has a mechanism that causes pollen to explosively spray on the plumage of the visiting bird which nips the tips.\n\nIn urban areas, they are particularly attracted to introduced fruit trees such as Muntingia calabura, the fruits of which may be swallowed whole or, in the case of ripe berries, crushed and the pulp accessed using their tongue. They also sip nectar from flowers such as those of Sterculia colorata and Woodfordia floribunda, pollinating them in the process.\n\nBreeding\nTickell's flowerpeckers breed from February to June. A second brood may be raised in September. The nest is a small pendant purse-like structure made of cobwebs, fibre, moss and down suspended from the tip of a twig high up in a tree. The opening is a slit and a clutch of two or three eggs is laid.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Internet Bird Collection\n\npale-billed flowerpecker\nBirds of India\nBirds of Bangladesh\nBirds of Myanmar\nBirds of Sri Lanka\npale-billed flowerpecker","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79454}

{"text":"Fred \"Fritz\" Klein (December 27, 1932 \u2013 May 24, 2006) was an Austrian-born American psychiatrist and sex researcher who studied bisexuals and their relationships. He was an author and editor, as well as the developer of the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid, a scale that measures an individual's sexual orientation. Klein believed that sexual orientation could change over the course of a lifetime and that researchers underestimated the number of men that had sexual interactions with both sexes. Fritz Klein founded the American Institute of Bisexuality in 1998, which is continuing his work by sponsoring bisexual-inclusive sex research, educating the general public on sexuality, and promoting bisexual culture and community.\n\nLife and career \nKlein was born in Vienna, Austria, to Orthodox Jewish parents. He and his family fled to New York City when he was a child, to escape antisemitism.\n\nHe received a BA from Yeshiva University in 1953, and an MBA from Columbia University in 1955. He studied medicine at University of Bern in Switzerland for six years, receiving his MD in 1961.\n\nSelf-identifying as bisexual, Klein was surprised at the lack of literature on his sexuality in the New York Public Library in 1974. That year he founded the Bisexual Forum, the world's first bisexual group.\n\nKlein Sexual Orientation Grid and other works\n\nHe devised the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid, a multi-dimensional system for describing complex sexual orientation, similar to the \"zero-to-six\" scale Kinsey scale used by Alfred Kinsey, but measuring seven different vectors of sexual orientation and identity (sexual attractions, sexual behavior, sexual fantasies, emotional preference, social preference, lifestyle and self-identification) separately, as they relate person's past, present and ideal future.\n\nKlein published The Bisexual Option: A Concept of One Hundred Percent Intimacy in 1978, based on his research. He also co-authored The Male, His Body, His Sex in 1978. Klein moved to San Diego in 1982. He published Bisexualities: Theory and Research in 1986. In 1998 he founded the American Institute of Bisexuality (AIB), also known as the Bisexual Foundation or the Bi Foundation, to encourage, support and assist research and education about bisexuality. Klein also founded the Journal of Bisexuality. He remained the Journal's principal editor until his death. He published Bisexual and Gay Husbands: Their Stories, Their Words in 2001.

{"text":"In medicine, Aschoff bodies are nodules found in the hearts of individuals with rheumatic fever. They result from inflammation in the heart muscle and are characteristic of rheumatic heart disease. These nodules were discovered independently by Ludwig Aschoff and Paul Rudolf Geipel, and for this reason they are occasionally called Aschoff-Geipel bodies.\n\nAppearance\nMicroscopically, Aschoff bodies are areas of inflammation of the connective tissue of the heart, or focal interstitial inflammation. Fully developed Aschoff bodies are granulomatous structures consisting of fibrinoid change, lymphocytic infiltration, occasional plasma cells, and characteristically abnormal macrophages surrounding necrotic centres. Some of these macrophages may fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. Others may become Anitschkow cells or \"caterpillar cells,\" so named because of the appearance of their chromatin.\n\nThey are pathognomic foci of fibrinoid necrosis found in many sites, most often the myocardium. Initially they are surrounded by lymphocytes, macrophages, and a few plasma cells, but they are slowly replaced by a fibrous scar. Aschoff bodies are found in all the three layers of the heart, least chance in the pericardium.\n\nPresence in cardiac lesions\n\nThe cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever are in the form of focal inflammatory involvement of the interstitial tissue in all 3 layers of the heart, a pathological change named pancarditis. The pathognomonic feature of pancarditis in the case of rheumatic heart disease is the presence of Aschoff nodules or Aschoff bodies.\n\nDetailed description\n\nThe Aschoff nodules are foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and activated macrophages (Anitschkow cells) pathognomonic of rheumatic fever. These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round nuclei in which chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon, the reason why they are sometimes called \"caterpillar cells\". \nThey are especially found in the vicinity of small blood vessels in the myocardium and endocardium and occasionally in the pericardium, and also the adventitia of the proximal part of the aorta. Lesions similar to the Aschoff nodules may also be found in extra-cardiac tissues.\n\nEvolution of Nodules\n\nEvolution of Aschoff nodules typically involve 3 stages of development all of which may be present in the heart at the same time of inspection.\n\nStage 1. Early exudative \/ degenerative stage the earliest sign of injury to the heart in rheumatic fever is apparent by fourth week of illness. Initially there is edema of the connective tissue and increase in acid mucopolysaccharide in the ground substance. This results in a separation of the collagen fibre by accumulating ground substance eventually the collagen fibres are fragmented and disintegrated and the affected focus takes the appearance and staining characteristics of fibrin.\n\nStage 2. Intermediate proliferative \/ granulomatous stage. It is at this stage of Aschoff bodies, which is pathognomonic of rheumatic fever. This stage is apparent in 4 to 13 weeks of illness. The early stage of fibrinoid change is replaced by infiltration of lymphocyte T cells, plasma cells, neutrophils and the characteristic cardiac histiocytes \/ Anitschkow cells at the margin of the lesion.\nCardiac Histiocytes \/ Anitschkow are present in small numbers in the heart but their numbers are increased in Aschoff nodules. therefore they are not characteristic of rheumatic heart disease\n\nStage 3. Late fibrosis stage.  It is the stage of healing by which the fibrosis of the Aschoff nodules occur in 12 to 16 weeks after the illness. The nodule becomes oval or fusiform in shape about 200 micrometer x 600 micrometer in width and length. With passage of months and years the Aschoff nodules becomes less cellular and collagenous tissue is increased. Eventually it is replaced by a small fibrocollagenous scar with little cellularity frequently located perivascularly.\n\nHistory\nThe Aschoff bodies were discovered independently by the German pathologist Ludwig Aschoff 1904 and one year later by Paul Rudolf Geipel.\n\nReferences\n\nHistopathology","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79457}

{"text":"is a business simulator video game developed and published by Capcom for the Family Computer exclusively in Japan in 1993. It is a spin-off video game to the original Mega Man series. It is similar to the board game Monopoly, in which players and the computer AI take turns going around a set of connected circles, buying up property, and charging other participants rent when they land on those spaces.\n\nCritical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been generally negative. An unreleased English translation and a canceled Game Boy version may have been in development.\n\nGameplay\nWily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise is a business simulation game in which the player chooses among several characters in the original Mega Man series and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of property. The characters include Roll, Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, and Kalinka. Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency). They can then charge other characters rent when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building. The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.\n\nDevelopment\nWily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise was developed by Capcom during a time when the Mega Man franchise was at its height of its popularity. Series artist Keiji Inafune had very little involvement in the development of Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise, simply designing the cover art and the new character Reggae. When developing the game, the team wanted to include as many bosses from previous titles in the series as possible. However, they ultimately decided to leave room for an original character that fans could associate with the new game. When discussing a bird character labeled , one of the team members misread it as , resulting in Reggae's resemblance to the species.\n\nThe January 1993 issue of the Mexican magazine Club Nintendo featured Wily & Right no RockBoard as part of a preview article for the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show. Titling the game as \"Mega Board\", the article even had a screenshot featuring English text. An unreleased Game Boy version was also in the works by the Japanese company Dual, which listed the game on the credits page of its official website, and the ROM of which was recovered in the Nintendo Gigaleak. Hitoshi Sakimoto was responsible for the audio in this version.\n\nReception\n\nCritical reception for Wily & Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise outside Japan has been poor. GameSpot contributors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer found the relatively obscure game to be of no particular interest to anyone other than Mega Man fans. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com summated, \"An oddity of the Famicom era, this import title was a simple \"Game of Life\"-style board game with a Mega Man motif -- novel, but hardly essential.\" GamesRadar editor Brett Elston called it a \"probably better-off-lost excursion into Mega-mediocrity.\" However, not all views of the game have been negative. JC Fletcher of Joystiq expressed desire for the game's release on the Wii's Virtual Console service. He opined that it is \"actually nowhere near as terrible as a Mega Man board game should be\" and that its various effects and winning conditions grant it a much faster pace than Monopoly.\n\nSee also\n\n Itadaki Street\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCapcom Global website\nOfficial Rockman website  \n\nMega Man spin-off games\n1993 video games\nBusiness simulation games\nCancelled Game Boy games\nDigital board games\nJapan-exclusive video games\nNintendo Entertainment System games\nNintendo Entertainment System-only games\nMultiplayer and single-player video games\nVideo games developed in Japan","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79459}

Series 4 began in March 2016, and consists of six online episodes and one televised special.\n\nGaiden (\u5916\u4f1d) is a Japanese word meaning 'side-story', a reference to the show's relationship to its predecessor Consolevania.\n\nFormat\n\nSeries One (2005)\n\nEach episode opened with a brief satirical mention of the show's status within the BBC and the feedback it has received. This was typically followed by the first of many discursive game reviews. These featured one of the two lead presenters walking around an indoor or outdoor setting discussing the game in question. Footage from the game was superimposed on background objects and occasionally cut to directly during the discussion.\n\nSomewhat in keeping with the way in which Consolevania was shot on MiniDV, the majority of series was filmed on a Sony HVR-Z1U .  This small scale camera made in possible to shoot series in 16:9, but without an expensive DigiBeta kit and crew; something that the small production budget would not allow.\n\nRecurring features unique to the first series were sketches about terrible video game pitches (like Black and White Minstrel Show 2006), Glasgow hard-man Barry Anoki reporting on video game news, and a spoof soap opera about video game development called DevCo. The \"Gaiden Top 100\" was ostensibly a series of talking-head interviews on the best games of all time, but in fact provided thinly veiled mockery or game-inspired jokes.\n\nEach episode in this series ended with a brief sketch which ran over the end credits, featuring a fictional world-famous video gamer called Legend (a carry-over from Consolevania) discussing his childhood.\n\nSeries Two (2006)\nThe second series had less of a sketch basis. While the opening comments and the style of reviews were the same and the Top 100 returned, most of the comedy was changed. This series also included a wide range of special guests, such as journalist Charlie Brooker and actor Colin Baker appearing in character as the Sixth Doctor.\n\nNon-game reviews were featured in the style of a new games journalism panel discussion called \"Eternal Pixel\" (compare to Newsnight Review). More episodes of Eternal Pixel were filmed than aired, with plans to release these additional episodes online; however, these did not come to fruition. In the first three episodes there was a \"funeral\" for a now-deceased console, followed by recommendations of notable games. Each episode included \"A Warning From History\", showcasing appalling old gaming action, followed by a game recommendation from Socrates, a \"games criticism robot\" made from cardboard. Of particular note was the \"Gaiden Guide to...\" series by Robert Florence, sternly calling for change in a particular aspect of gaming culture (for example standards of journalism). Each episode of the second series signed off with a song about the series' far-from-universal appeal.\n\nThe show also ran an (apparently BBC-sanctioned) campaign to have the Shenmue series either continued or permanently consigned to history. Rab and Ryan called on gamers to produce Shenmue tributes or outright mockery, respectively. Updates on the progress of the campaign including notable comments on the internet were included in each episode. Rab won overall, with the public favouring the return of Shenmue. However, an unofficial statement from Sega warned them not to expect a new installment for some time.\n\nThe series ended with \"The VideoGaiden Awards 2006\" in which Rab and Ryan chose the best game of 2006. The winner of this award was Hitman: Blood Money. It was also in this episode that Rab fell on Socrates, crushing him beyond repair in the process.\n\nSeries Three (2007\u20132008) \nSeries three was broadcast online on the BBC's VideoGaiden website, with each weekly episode lasting around 11 to 13 minutes. The series generally contained two regular reviews lasting a couple of minutes each, and one shorter review comprising only video game footage and voice overs. These would be interspersed with short comedy sketches. Each episode would also have a bookending pair of sketches that would only rarely be returned to during the course of the series as a whole.\n\nAn ongoing serial called Hunter and Rayorg featuring CGI versions of Rab and Ryan was one of only two recurring sketches. The other was VideoGaiden Worldwide News, which had Rab and Ryan interviewing a number of correspondents: a manager from a games store in Scotland (G-Force, Glasgow) who announced that week's top-selling titles; an English correspondent who is clearly Scottish; and a woman in Japan, who would always end up reviewing Japanese cuisine, despite claiming that she was talking about video games. Each week would also see Rab and Ryan trying to contact a representative in the US, before announcing that they couldn't get the satellite link-up working and giving up. This was changed briefly in episodes four and five, when US comedians Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (both of Tom Goes to the Mayor fame) made guest appearances.\n\nSeries Four (2016) \nOn New Year's Eve 2015, Ryan Macleod and Robert Florence via Periscope announced a return of videoGaiden, after eight years. The first episode was released on YouTube on 3 March 2016. Series 4 features review segments, the videoGaiden top 100, Ryan's coverage of indie games, Rab's coverage of board games and segments of the two realising they are trapped in an existential prison.\n\nSee also\n\n Legit\n Robert Florence\n Burnistoun\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nBBC Scotland television shows\nTelevision shows about video games\n2005 Scottish television series debuts\n2008 Scottish television series endings\n2000s Scottish television series","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79466}

{"text":"The Seven Holy Founders of the Servite Order, by name Bonfilius, Alexis, Manettus, Amideus, Hugh, Sostene and Buonagiunta of Florence, were seven holy men of the town of Florence whom became bound to each other in a spiritual friendship that were eventually called by the Virgin Mother of God in a vision that they reportedly all shared in one and the same moment (though at first each was unaware that the other saw what he saw), whom they practised an intense devotion towards, to 'Leave the World, the Better to Serve Almighty God'.  \n\nBonfilius of Florence was born Bonfilius Monaldi (Buonfiglio dei Monaldi), Alexis of Florence was born Alexis Falconieri () (1200 \u2013 17 February 1310), Manettus of Florence was born Benedict dell'Antella (Benedetto dell' Antella), Amideus of Florence was born Bartholemew Amidei (also Bartolomeo degli Amidei; died 1265), Hugh of Florence was born Ricovero Uguccioni (Hugh dei Lippi Uggucioni (Ricovero dei Lippi-Ugguccioni)), Sostene of Florence was born Gerardino Sostegni (Gherardino di Sostegno) and Buonagiunta of Florence was born John Manetti (Giovanni di Buonagiunta (Bonajuncta)).\n\nThe founders\n\nAlexis Falconieri\n\nFalconieri was one of the seven founders of the Servite Order, who are celebrated together on the anniversary of his death.\n\nLife\nHe was the son of Bernardo Falconieri, a merchant prince of Florence, and one of the leaders of the Republic. His family belonged to the Guelph party, and opposed the Imperialists whenever they could consistently with their political principles.\n\nFalconieri grew up in the practice of the most profound humility. He became a wealthy noble in one of Italy's most wealthy and cultured cities. Falconieri joined the Laudesi, a pious confraternity of the Blessed Virgin, and there met the six future companions of his life of sanctity. According to tradition, he was favoured with an apparition of the Mother of God, 15 August 1233, as were these companions. The seven soon afterwards founded the Order of the Servites. Falconieri at once abandoned all, and retired to La Camarzia, a house on the outskirts of the town, and the following year to Monte Senario. Falconieri was bestowed the title of Founder and Mystic.\n\nWith humility, he traversed, as a mendicant, in quest of alms for his brethren, the streets of the city through which he had lately moved as a prominent citizen. So deep and sincere was his humility that, though he lived to the great age of hundred and ten years, he always refused to enter the priesthood, of which he deemed himself unworthy.\n\nHis duties were confined principally to the material needs of the various communities in which he lived. In 1252 the new church at Cafaggio, on the outskirts of Florence, was completed under his care, with the financial assistance of Chiarissimo Falconieri. Giuliana Falconieri, his niece, was trained in sanctity under his personal direction.\n\nThe influence exerted on his countrymen by Falconieri and his companions may be gathered from the fact that in a few years ten thousand persons had enrolled themselves under the banner of the Blessed Virgin in the Servite Order.\n\nHe died in Monte Senario at about 110 years of age on 17 February 1310.\n\nHis shrine and entombed body is near the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. Clement XI declared Falconieri worthy of the veneration of the faithful, 1 December 1717, and accorded the same honour to his six companions on 3 July 1725.\n\nAmadeus of the Amidei\n\nAmadeus of the Amidei (died 1265) was also known as Bartolomeo degli Amidei.  He was one of the seven founders of the Servite Order in 1233. He was born into the Amidei family in the Republic of Florence, and died at Monte Senario in 1265.  His feast day is with the other six, on 17 February.\n\nHugh dei Lippi Ugguccioni\nHugh dei Lippi Ugguccioni was one of the founders of the Order, who were collectively known as the Seven Holy Founders.  He served as the vicar general of the Servites in Germany, having initially followed Philip Benizi to France and Germany. He died in Germany on 3 May 1282\n\nLegacy\nPope Leo XIII canonized them all on 15 January 1888.  After the canonization of the seven founders, their feast was inserted in the General Roman Calendar for celebration on 11 February, the anniversary of the granting of canonical approval to the order in 1304. In 1909, 11 February became the feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, and the feast of the seven founders was moved to 12 February. In the 1969 revision of the calendar, 17 February, the date of death of Alexis Falconieri was judged more appropriate.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nHolweck, F.

{"text":"The Dal-Tex Building is a seven-story office building located at 501 Elm Street in the West End Historic District of downtown Dallas, Texas, United States. The building is located on the northeast corner of Elm and North Houston Streets, across the street from the Texas School Book Depository in Dealey Plaza, the scene of the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The Dal-Tex Building, sometimes called the Dallas-Textiles Building, the Dal-Tex Market Building, or the Dal-Tex Mart Building, was a center of the textile business in Dallas.\n\nDesigned by architects James P. Hubbell and Herbert Miller Greene as a warehouse for the Kingman Texas Implement Company, the building has been described as one of the \"earliest Sullivanesque designs in Texas\". The building has also been reported to show the Prairie School's influence on Greene.\n\nAssassination of Kennedy\nAbraham Zapruder, who shot the famous Zapruder film, had his offices on the fourth floor of the Dal-Tex Building.\n\nConspiracy theories\nSeveral conspiracy theories in the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy allege that some of the shots fired at the President's motorcade originated from the Dal-Tex Building. In September 1966, Triumph Lawrence R. Brown published an article stating that the bullet trajectories were traced back to a second floor window in the Dal-Tex Building. Jim Garrison told Playboy in September 1967 that the building was \"in all probability\" as being one of four locations in which snipers fired at Kennedy. Garrison later claimed that there were four assassination teams, each consisting of a rifleman and a lookout, including one on the seventh floor of the building. In November 1967, Josiah Thompson stated that his study allowed him to conclude that there were four shots from three different firing positions during the assassination. Thompson also concluded that the Dal-Tex Building was located in a zone also including the Dallas County Records Building and parts of the Dallas Criminal Courts Building that he determined could have been the location for the source of the second shot. He said that a young man was arrested just minutes after the shooting, taken in for questioning by police, then disappeared in the confusion.\n\nIn the May 1970 issue of Computers and Automation, Richard E. Sprague said that he used computer analysis of still photographs and movie films taken in Dealey Plaza. Implicating four gunmen and at least 50 conspirators in Kennedy's assassination, he concluded that two shots had come from the Dal-Tex Building. Five years later in September 1975, Sprague and L. Fletcher Prouty stated that their study of still photographs and film of the assassination revealed that the fourth floor of the Dal-Tex Building was one of three or four firing positions during the assassination.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nSee also\n\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Texas\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Dallas County, Texas\nList of Dallas Landmarks\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nImage of original architectural plans for the Elm Street elevation\n\nOffice buildings in Dallas\nBuildings and structures associated with the assassination of John F.

{"text":"Barium titanate (BTO) is an inorganic compound with chemical formula BaTiO3. Barium titanate appears white as a powder and is transparent when prepared as large crystals.  It is a ferroelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric ceramic material that exhibits the photorefractive effect.  It is used in capacitors, electromechanical transducers and nonlinear optics.\n\nStructure\n\nThe solid exists in one of four polymorphs depending on temperature. From high to low temperature, these crystal symmetries of the four polymorphs are cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral crystal structure. All of these phases exhibit the ferroelectric effect apart from the cubic phase.  The high temperature cubic phase is easiest to describe, as it consists of regular corner-sharing octahedral TiO6 units that define a cube with O vertices and Ti-O-Ti edges.  In the cubic phase, Ba2+ is located at the center of the cube, with a nominal coordination number of 12.  Lower symmetry phases are stabilized at lower temperatures and involve movement of the Ti4+ to off-center positions.  The remarkable properties of this material arise from the cooperative behavior of the Ti4+ distortions.\n\nAbove the melting point, the liquid has a remarkably different local structure to the solid forms, with the majority of Ti4+ coordinated to four oxygen, in tetrahedral TiO4 units, which coexist with more highly coordinated units.\n\nProduction and handling properties\n\nBarium titanate can be synthesized by the relatively simple sol\u2013hydrothermal method. \nBarium titanate can also be manufactured by heating barium carbonate and titanium dioxide.  The reaction proceeds via liquid phase sintering. Single crystals can be grown at around 1100\u00a0\u00b0C from molten potassium fluoride.   Other materials are often added as dopants, e.g., Sr to form solid solutions with strontium titanate. It reacts with nitrogen trichloride and produces a greenish or gray mixture; the ferroelectric properties of the mixture are still present in this form.\n\nMuch effort has been spent studying the relationship between particle morphology and its properties. Barium titanate is one of the few ceramic compounds known to exhibit abnormal grain growth, in which large faceted grains grow in a matrix of finer grains, with profound implications on densification and physical properties.   Fully dense nanocrystalline barium titanate has 40% higher permittivity than the same material prepared in classic ways. The addition of inclusions of barium titanate to tin has been shown to produce a bulk material with a higher viscoelastic stiffness than that of diamonds. Barium titanate goes through two phase transitions that change the crystal shape and volume. This phase change leads to composites where the barium titanates have a negative bulk modulus (Young's modulus), meaning that when a force acts on the inclusions, there is displacement in the opposite direction, further stiffening the composite.\n\nLike many oxides, barium titanate is insoluble in water but attacked by sulfuric acid. Its bulk room-temperature bandgap is 3.2 eV, but this increases to ~3.5 eV when the particle size is reduced from about 15 to 7\u00a0nm.\n\nUses\n\nBarium titanate is a dielectric ceramic used in capacitors, with dielectric constant values as high as 7,000. Over a narrow temperature range, values as high as 15,000 are possible; most common ceramic and polymer materials are less than 10, while others, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), have values between 20 and 70.\n\nIt is a piezoelectric material used in microphones and other transducers. The spontaneous polarization of barium titanate single crystals at room temperature range between 0.15C\/m2 in earlier studies, and 0.26C\/m2 in more recent publications, and its Curie temperature is between 120 and 130\u00a0\u00b0C. The differences are related to the growth technique, with earlier flux grown crystals being less pure than current crystals grown with the Czochralski process, which therefore have a larger spontaneous polarization and a higher Curie temperature.\n\nAs a piezoelectric material, it has been largely replaced by lead zirconate titanate, also known as PZT. Polycrystalline barium titanate has a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, making it a useful material for thermistors and self-regulating electric heating systems.\n\nBarium titanate crystals find use in nonlinear optics. The material has high beam-coupling gain, and can be operated at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. It has the highest reflectivity of the materials used for self-pumped phase conjugation (SPPC) applications. It can be used for continuous-wave four-wave mixing with milliwatt-range optical power. For photorefractive applications, barium titanate can be doped by various other elements, e.g. iron.\n\nThin films of barium titanate display electrooptic modulation to frequencies over 40\u00a0GHz.\n\nThe pyroelectric and ferroelectric properties of barium titanate are used in some types of uncooled sensors for thermal cameras.\n\nBarium titanate is widely used in thermistors and positive temperature coefficient heating elements.  For these applications, barium  titanate is manufactured with dopants to give the material semiconductor properties. Specific applications include overcurrent protection for motors, ballasts for fluorescent lights, automobile cabin air heaters, and consumer space heaters.\n\nHigh-purity barium titanate powder is reported to be a key component of new barium titanate capacitor energy storage systems for use in electric vehicles.\n\nDue to their elevated biocompatibility, barium titanate nanoparticles (BTNPs) have been recently employed as nanocarriers for drug delivery.\n\nMagnetoelectric effect of giant strengths have been reported in thin films grown on barium titanate substrates.\n\nNatural occurrence\nBarioperovskite is a very rare natural analogue of BaTiO3, found as microinclusions in benitoite.\n\nSee also\nStrontium titanate\nLead zirconate titanate\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nNanoparticle Compatibility: New Nanocomposite Processing Technique Creates More Powerful Capacitors\nEEStor's \"instant-charge\" capacitor batteries\n\nTitanates\nBarium compounds\nCeramic materials\nPiezoelectric materials\nFerroelectric materials\nInfrared sensor materials\nNonlinear optical materials\nPerovskites","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79470}

{"text":"The lex Claudia () also known as the plebiscitum Claudianum or the lex Claudia de nave senatoris, was a Roman law passed in 218 BC. Proposed at the start of the Second Punic War, the law prohibited senators and their sons from owning an \"ocean-going ship\" (maritimam navem) which had a capacity of more than 300 amphorae. It was proposed by the tribune Quintus Claudius and supported by a senator Gaius Flaminius (consul 223 BC and 217 BC). There are no surviving contemporary sources for the law; the only ancient source to explicitly discuss it being the historian Livy. While Cicero (consul 63 BC) does mention the law in his prosecution of Verres in 70 BC, this is only an indirect reference. As such, the ancient evidence is limited and only dates from nearly two centuries later. Nonetheless, modern scholarship has continued to debate the purpose and significance of the lex Claudia.\n\nHistorical context\n\nThird Century naval expansion \nAfter Rome's expansion during the First Punic War (263-241 BC), Roman imperialism around the Mediterranean Sea saw the beginnings of economic exploitations of newly formed provinces. This naval activity increased throughout the third century. The passage of the lex Claudia, designed to restrict shipping, is indicative of this increased naval activity. For if there was no naval merchant activity, there would have been no need for such a law. The development of coinage and credit systems as well as the advancement in communication through roads, rivers and harbours, meant that long-distance trade became a significant aspect of the empire's economy. Imported goods included food, slaves, metals and luxury goods, while exports consisted largely of pottery, gold and silver. Rome's commercial interests were further expanded after Sicily and Sardinia become a province at the end of the First Punic War. Commercial ships were expensive and costly to maintain, meaning that only members of the upper classes (senators and equestrians) were able to invest in long-distance shipping. However, little is definitively known concerning the exact circumstances that led to the creation of the lex Claudia.\n\nSecond Punic War influence \nAlthough the law was proposed at the start of the Second Punic War, it is difficult to say what impact this new war would have had, if any, on the passage of the law. After all, the Romans were nearly always at war during the third century BC. However, it is of course possible that the advent of the new war made an impact. The lex Claudia's ulterior purpose might have been to secure private ships for use in the war. The targeted ships were probably large enough to carry the troops and supplies needed for warfare. If so, the law would then serve to aid the equestrians' merchant ambitions, limit the influence of senators and provide commanders with ships large enough to carry troops and supplies.\n\nConflict of the Orders \nThe third century BC may have also seen the resurgence of conflicts between the patrician and the plebeian classes. When the Roman Republic (res publica) was founded in 509 BC, it attempted to readjust the balance of power in favour of the people. However, the patrician class, made up of elite families, quickly began to dominate the political scene at the expense of the majority, the plebeians. The conflicts between the patricians and plebeians came to be known as the Conflict of the Orders. By 290 BC these conflicts largely came to an end when plebeian consuls were introduced. However, patrician\/plebeian issues still surfaced from time-to-time in the later Republic. Although the most well-documented example of this conflict arose around the Gracchi (133\/123 BC), it is possible that the passage of the lex Claudia may also be an example of this continuing theme.\n\nProposed by a tribune of the plebs and aimed at senators, the lex Claudia may be seen as an example of the plebeian order struggling to get ahead. However, by 218 BC there were plebeian consuls and senators. The plebeians were in the senate and were able to obtain the consulship. The ultimate beneficiaries of the lex Claudia were probably the equestrian class, rich citizens not in the senate. As rich traders, equestrians would not have been affected by the law and so would have been able to continue trading. If so, then the proposal for and then the passage of the lex Claudia would indicate a struggle not so much concerning patricians and plebeians, but senators and non-senators.\n\nReasons for the law \nWarfare contributed to a significant portion of Rome's income. As a result, war generals and their goods, including their ships, were needed. These war entrepreneurs usually came from higher-status men of the nobility- especially ranking officers. Rome needed to fund these wars and so often required financial help from affluent people and their private fortune. In fact, some of these wealthy citizens had profitable currency manipulation schemes that helped supply the war effort with revenue. An example of how personal wealth played a role in Roman governance was in the year 217 BC, a year after the lex Claudia was passed. The senate, which controlled the finances of Rome, refused to pay the ransom of a captured Roman citizen Fabius Maximus. Disappointed, but not deterred by this, Fabius Maximus paid his ransom from his own wealth. This example, from a similar time as the lex Claudia, demonstrates that private wealth could be used in public affairs. It tells us that the public and private were intertwined. If a man was wealthy enough to pay his own ransom, then there were probably enough elite males with ample wealth and goods to contribute to war expenditure.\n\nMoney was also needed to pay soldiers. The financial support of elites played a crucial role in supporting Roman desires to wage wars. They provided more than money though as they also served as privateers and ship owners in the First and Second Punic Wars. They were the backbone with their financial investments which helped pave the way for Rome to introduce its precious metal currency to the empire. The lex Claudia would be the solution to the corruption of Roman governance and prevent private investors from forcing further taxes from ordinary Roman citizens to increase private profit. It was also a way of preventing senators from having any involvement in the transport of grain that was obtained through taxes.\n\nIt is possible that the Second Punic War as well as profiteering influenced the passage of the lex Claudia. Many affluent Romans were involved in business as well as war, and an example of this is conflict over Saguntum. This conflict foreshadowed the Second Punic War and the lex Claudia in a number of ways. Firstly, elite citizens profited from supplying provisions overseas for the war effort. Secondly, it tells us about the links between Roman warfare and shipping. For when the Romans fought the Carthaginians in Spain and Africa for their lands, the commands were given to the consuls of 218 BC. One of the consuls, Sempronius Longus, was provided with 160 ships and the other consul, Cornelius Scipio, was provided with a fleet of 60 ships. Both consuls had previously gained wealth during the First Punic War. Furthermore during the Saguntum conflict, the two consuls may have also invested their money into their fleets to save for the potential wars to come and therefore were profiteering from their shipping, the kind of behaviour the lex Claudia would prohibit. This could have been a reason why the lex Claudia came about \u2013 particularly as it was in the same year (218 BC). Many investors also appeared to play a major role in influencing the Second Macedonian War as well. Indeed as these war entrepreneurs were potentially dissatisfied with the spoils of the First Punic War and the subsequent peace treaty, they pressed for another.\n\nProvisions and passage\n\nProvisions of the law \nA significant aspect of the lex Claudia was its specificity about the size and quantity of goods. The law stipulated that senators could not own ships that were large enough to carry 300 amphorae (or more). 300 amphorae was the size limitation that would still allow goods to be transferred from farming estates to the markets. Assuming that full-sized amphora weighted approximately 38 kilograms, the maximum dead weight was just under 11.5 tonnes. This limit was a concrete way of preventing quaestus (which broadly refers to profit that does not derive from agriculture). To operate a vessel in quaestum was considered dishonourable for a senator. Indeed Livy states that this size limitation reinforced the patrician distaste for making a profit through trade activity. This implies that long-distance trade was primarily dictated by the senatorial class's domination of the sea. Furthermore, Livy describes the lex Claudia as a means to weaken the economic interest of the elite. The lex Claudia aimed to minimise the distraction from the life of leisure that was necessary for the political affairs of senators, as well as prevent corruption and conflicts of interests.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the law restricted senators' sons from owning large ships as well. This aspect undermines the principle of the hereditary advantage of elites, particularly patricians, which was a fundamental element of Roman society. Senators, the top of society in a culture obsessed with status, were restricted by this law in their ownership of ships. Therefore, those who benefited from the lex Claudia were the equestrian order, who were rich enough to invest in the ships and were not senators.\n\nPassage of the law \nThe law's alternative title as plebiscitum Claudianum and the fact that Quintus Claudius was a tribune of the plebs both how the law was passed. The title plebiscitum refers to resolutions which were passed by the consilium plebis, the plebeian assembly, which was convened a presided over by the tribune of the plebs. Despite previous restrictions during this period, the passage of plebiscitum did not rely on the approval of the senate and were binding for all citizens. Although they accounted for a significant amount of Roman legislation, they remained a pathway for challenging the authority of the senate and this is most likely why lex Claudia was passed using this method, given the senatorial resistance to it.\n\nSupporters \nThe prominent figures involved with the passage of this law were tribune Quintus Claudius and Gaius Flaminius, the senator. Unfortunately the only information known about Quintus Claudius is that he passed this law. On the other hand, Gaius Flaminius Nepos, while also a plebeian, had quite a distinguished career as a novus homo, even reaching the office of Censor. But his support of the unpopular lex Claudia was not the first time he came into conflict with the Senate. As a Tribune of the Plebs (232 BC), he apparently fought the Senate a lot in his attempt to pass a law providing needy settlers land in the ager Gallicus. Furthermore when he was Consul, Flaminius was refused a triumph by the Senate after his victory against the Gallic Insubres (223 BC) due to his disregard for unfavourable omens, only for this judgement to be overturned by popular demand. Due to his apparent affinity with the people, he has often been characterised as a demagogue, with Cicero even treating him as a precursor to the Gracchi. On the other hand he still may have had support amongst the plebeian elite within the Senate, reducing his demagogic portrayal. Nevertheless, Flaminius' resistance to the Senate arguably reflects the resurgence of the Struggle of the Orders between the patricians and plebeians during the Roman Republic. His plebeian sentiments against the Senate would explain his motivations behind supporting the lex Claudia and the manner in which it was passed, however this cannot be confirmed.\n\nEnforcement \nThe fact that lex Claudia was obsolete by the late Roman Republic seems to suggest a lack of enforcement. During the Republican period, Roman law was not codified and therefore compliance to laws relied upon how well they were known. As a result, the process of enforcement through prosecutions and self-regulation was integral to the future enforcement of the law. Therefore the disappearance of lex Claudia and limited mentions in ancient source material could indicate that the law was not well enforced. This is most likely because the patrician senators who opposed the law were responsible for its enforcement.\n\nReactions \nThe initial reactions to the law cannot be known conclusively due to the lack of contemporary evidence. From Livy's evidence, there were two main responses. Senators, as would be expected, were incensed by the law and Flaminius fled Rome shortly after it was passed. However, it is interesting that elites would be in opposition to the law at all because traditionally, patricians saw profit-making through trade as anathema. Since this law, by implication, restricted the amount of goods that could be transported at any one time, it was actually in-line with mos maiorum, the traditional way of doing things. Upper classes were subject to this strict set of traditions regarding behaviour that could be seen as improper for a member of their class. If Livy's sources are correct, it would have been rather unusual that there was elite hostility towards the law. It is possible that a large number of senators at this time were plebeian and if so, they perhaps would not share this old value. Or it might be an example of laws taking precedence over mos maiorum. Indeed the abuse of mos maiorum's flexibility led to the increased use of regulations through statutory law rather than informal traditions. In this view, the lex Claudia was a law that simply reinterpreted the tradition of patrician distaste for trade, applying it to all senators. In terms of senatorial dislike of the law, Flaminius himself was also unpopular, due to illegalities earlier in his career. He may have already become a 'dead letter' by the time of Cato the Elder, however the moral stigma of the law may have still been present in society.\n\nOn the other hand, the Roman populace appears to have welcomed the law. Livy tells us that through his support of the lex Claudia, Flaminius earned popularity and secured another consulship.\n\nAlthough Cicero indicates that lex Claudia had become obsolete by the later Roman Republic, the fact that he is prosecuting Verres for his actions in Sicily reveals that the actions of the senators during public commands remained a real concern and the subject of legislation throughout the Republican period. It seems likely the law became obsolete due to a combination of the senatorial class's dislike for it and the fact that as the empire grew, opportunities for corruption increased, meaning that trade was less of a concern.\n\nModern historiography \nWhilst most modern historians share an overarching view regarding the intention of the lex Claudia, it has been interpreted differently by many scholars.\n\nIntention of Lex Claudia \nMost modern scholars agree that the lex Claudia was created with the intention to restrict the economic, social and political power of the elite class who posed a threat prior to the introduction of the law. Both Aubert and Feig Vishnia harmoniously interpret Livy's description of the lex Claudia as a measure that was devised by politicians to weaken the economic interest of the elite. D'Arms also agrees that the law was the result of an attempt to cut down on elite wealth and domination. Additionally, Bleckmann observes that the Lex Claudia was established to help safeguard against war profiteers benefitting too greatly from the transportation of supplies by private citizens during a time of war. Historians Claude Nicolet and Feig Vishnia have also proposed further intentions of the law.  Nicolet also suggests that the lex Claudia forbid senators from pursuing 'any kind of activity for grain'. Furthermore, Feig Vishnia suggests that the lex Claudia could have been intended not only to forbid the senators and their sons from owning sea-going ships whose capacity exceeded 300 amphorae, but also to obstruct a growing senatorial inclination to compete for military contracts. However, she also acknowledges that this law may have been the reaction to the 'looming threat' of Hannibal advancing towards Italy in August September 218 BC. She goes on to state that 'In the atmosphere of uncertainty, when people's anxiety and anger at their leader's miscalculation after the Second Illyrian War had yielded very little booty and senators who had opposed the Claudian measure withdrew their objection'. Tchernia refers to a more superstitious intention suspected by Boudewijn Sirks who believed the Lex Claudia derived from an old religious taboo: that senators must avoid the sea because it signifies death. This alludes to old Roman fears and stories of the sea which was viewed as a tempting yet treacherous place of risk, evil, worry and \"punic treachery\".\n\nEffect of Lex Claudia and its implications \nWhilst modern historians tend to share a similar, overarching view of the intention of the lex Claudia, the ways in which it actually had an effect appears to be a subject of debate. Within his work, D'Arms mentions that the law is a reaffirmation of traditional values, particularly landed aristocratic ideal,  a desire to have senators revert to their mos maiorum. This reflected a desire for the elite to focus on acquiring land rather than maritime exploits. Aubert suggests that law highlights the growing power of the ruling class and, in turn, the fear of the Roman State who became threatened by the growing economic, social and political power of those who chose not to pursue a political career. As a result, Aubert observes that the Roman State tightened the reins on economic activities of its ruling class to ensure its survival by preventing possible social and political devaluation that had resulted from 'entrepreneurship gone awry'. According to Aubert the formation of the lex Claudia proved beneficial to the further development of the law of commerce. Whilst Aubert appears certain of the effect that the law had, D'Arms points out that there was a clear evasion of the law in the Late Republic but that we can not be sure of the social mechanisms for evading the law. Additionally, Bleckmann states that the law did in fact, lead to 'corrupt practices taking place among people of higher standing to make money'. This observation is shared with Feig Vishnia who believed that an incident in 215-213 was the result of the implementation of the lex Claudia.\n\nBeneficiaries \nWhilst Livy's account suggests that the economic interest of the elite would be weakened by the lex Claudia, modern scholars tend to agree that this is not at all the case. Within his work, Aubert states that those rich enough to afford large ships (mainly the equestrian order) were in fact the main beneficiaries of the law. Contrastingly, within her account, Feig Vishnia believes that an incident that occurred in 215 BC reveals the beneficiaries of the law. She states that in 215 BC, the senate had to turn to 'those who had increased their property from public contracts' to financially support Spanish armies with the promise that they would be reimbursed. In 213 BC, publicans abused this term by reporting fictitious shipwrecks and demanding compensation from the State. According Feig Vishnia, this incident symbolises that the publicans who owned sea going ships were the chief beneficiaries of the Lex Claudia.\n\nAftermath \nCicero alludes that since 218 BC the prohibition had become an unexceptional part of everyday life for the senators \u2013 and apparently this would continue until the fourth century AD. Although D'arms suggests that the lex Claudia may have already become outdated by Cicero's time in 70 BC. This observation appears to be shared by Nicolet who suggests that 'this had already become a dead letter by the time of the elder Cato who lent money on bottomry (a system of merchant insurance in which a ship is used as security against a loan to finance a voyage, the lender losing their money if the ship sinks), but the moral stigma remained'.\n\nSee also \n Roman Law\n List of Roman laws\n\nReferences\n\nRoman law\nAdmiralty law\n218 BC","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikipedia","id":79472}

{"text":"Hillegersberg is a neighbourhood of Rotterdam, Netherlands.  Primarily a green residential area with lakes, canals and parks, it was incorporated into the city of Rotterdam in 1941.\n\nHistory\n\nHillegersberg was named after Hildegard van Vlaanderen, wife of Count Dirk II of Holland and West Friesland (920-988).  The village was founded on a hill, form by a ridge of sand known locally as a donk or morre.  Local flint finds here indicate pre-historic occupation and later discoveries of Roman pottery, medals as well as a bust of Emperor Hadrian show subsequent early activity in the area.\n\nAccording to legend, this ridge was formed by sand dropped from the apron of the mythical giant Hillegonda. She was said to have built her house on this ridge and so Hillegersberg, then known as Hillegonda's mountain, was named. The image of the giant Hillegonda with her torn apron is shown on Hillegersberg's coat of arms.  A church and a castle, , were subsequently built on the ridge.\n\nThe castle was first mentioned in a certificate of November 2, 1269 documenting a loan from Vranke Stozep van Hildegardsberg.  Later in 1343, Heer Kerstant van den Berge owned the church and the castle. However, in 1426, both church and castle were destroyed by the armies of Jacoba of Bavaria, during the Hoekse and Kabeljauwse quarrels. Remnants of the castle dungeon may still be found next to the Hillegondakerk in a corner of the cemetery, which dates from around 1500 in its present form.  The structure was designated a national monument in September 1973.\n\nHillegersberg's population grew from 2,000 inhabitants in 1885 to 7,000 in 1904. The border between Hillegersberg and Rotterdam has changed several times. In 1904 and 1920 parts of Hillegersberg were annexed by Rotterdam. Despite this, Hillegersberg's population would increase to 5,000 in 1920.  In 1941, the area was absorbed completely in Rotterdam.  In 1979 the area became part of the sub-municipality of Hillegersberg-Schiebroek which then became a Gebied of the same name in 2014.  A Gebied has an advisory commission which represents those living in the area. By January 2018, the sub-municipality of Hillegersberg-Schiebroek, of which Hillergersberg is a part, had a population of 43,991.\n\nHillegersberg's growth has been explained partly due to its attractiveness for well-to-do residents because of its lakes such as the , attractions like the Plaswijckpark and Lommerrijk, as well as its proximity to the centre of the city.  Hillegersberg is considered to be one of the most prosperous sub-municipalities of Rotterdam.  This is based on the number of expensive homes there, the quality of its amenities, and the luxury stores in its village centre.\n\nCharacter\n\nHillegersberg has been described as a \"leafy suburb (which) escaped wartime bombing, leaving its old village centre and elegant residential streets intact.\"  Plaswijk and other local recreation parks were first established here in the early 1920s.  Hillegersberg's amenities have increased over time, with the creation for example of the Lage Bergse Bos a recreational area of 216 hectare in 1970.  This wooded area, which lies to the North-east of Hillegersberg, is interspersed with open areas of water and grassland. A part of it is grazed by Scottish Highlander cattle.\n\nThe village contains (with the addition of the Nieuwe Hillegersberg development) three shopping centres: the original village itself (around the old core - Bergse Dorpsstraat, Weissenbruchlaan), and the Kleiweg and its surrounding street and the shopping center at the Van Beethovensingel.\n\nA local resident organisation InHillegersberg was established in 2015 from the Bewonersorganisatie Molenlaankwartier along with residents of Oud-Hillegersberg (old Hillegersgerberg).  Its aim is to improve communications to residents and to protect the neighbourhood from negative developments.\n\nGeography\n\nHillegersberg is located on the north side of the municipality of Rotterdam. It is located in an area of woods and lakes (the Bergse-Plassen), the site of two former peat excavations. The Straatweg runs between these lakes, flanked by the large villas and apartment buildings.  Eastern Hillegersberg is bordered by the river Rotte. However, water has presented serious problems to the residents.  Many older houses suffer from foundation problems due to rotting wooden foundations, so-called \u2018paalrot' due to the lowering of the water table by the City authorities.\n\nThe neighbourhood benefits from good communication links with Rotterdam International airport, four railways stations, two tram lines (4 and 8), four bus lines  (35, 174, B10 and B17) and the A20 Autoroute all lying in close proximity.\n\nThe Sint Franciscus Gasthuis (hospital) is located on the south-western edge of Hillegersberg.\n\nTown Halls \n\nThe last town hall of Hillegersberg, prior to its annexation by Rotterdam in 1941, was the Buitenlust villa on the C.N.A. Looslaan 1. This villa was built in 1884 in the style of the neo-Renaissance by architect J.J. van Waning (1830-1917) and was commissioned by the De Kat family.\n\nThis building became the town hall of the independent municipality of Hillegersberg between 1921 and 1941.  After the municipality's annexation by Rotterdam, it went on to hold the offices of the city's district of Hillegersberg-Schiebroek.  This site is now the location for a nursery and kindergarten as well as a wedding hall.\n\nHillegersberg's early town hall may be seen at 10 Kerkstraat in the area's old village centre.  It was built in 1752 and is now serves as a location for a restaurant.\n\nBoth buildings have been designated as national monuments.\n\nEducation\n\nHillegersberg has twelve schools covering different ages and educational levels as specified and accredited by the Dutch education system.\n\nThe American International School of Rotterdam (AISR) was established in the area in 1959. In 2020, AISR became Nord Anglia International School Rotterdam.\n\nThe Japanese School of Rotterdam, a Japanese international day school, was also set up here in 1996.  The Hague-Rotterdam Japanese Saturday School (\u30cf\u30fc\u30b0\u30fb\u30ed\u30c3\u30c6\u30eb\u30c0\u30e0\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 H\u0101gu Rotterudamu Nihongo Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d), a Japanese Saturday school was also formed here in 1996 by the merger of existing Saturday schools in The Hague and Rotterdam, holds its classes at the Rotterdam Japanese day school.\n\nResidents\nJanwillem van de Wetering, writer\nHerman den Blijker, celebrity chef\nAnton Houtsma (1938-2014), Mayor  (nl)\nAntony Moens (1827-1899), Member of Parliament (nl)\n Willebrord Nieuwenhuis (1938-2006), journalist  (nl)\n Wim Nijs (1902-1961), painter (nl)\nAlbert Dolmans (1928-2021), painter (nl)\n\nFurther reading \nH.
