This program allows users to create vector images as well as raster images such as photographs. \n \n In order to get started we will take some time out to explain exactly what these terms mean so let's begin! \n \n \n \n Vector Images are created when lines are drawn between points instead of pixels being placed side-by-side. These types of images allow designers to scale their work without losing quality because they don't rely upon pixel density but rather line thickness.  \n \n Raster Images are created when dots are arranged into squares called \"pixels\". When viewed closely enough all computer screens display only individual pixels; therefore if you zoomed right in close enough you'd see each dot individually. Because of this fact, any image displayed on screen would appear jagged no matter how high its resolution was set. However, once printed onto paper there wouldn't really be much difference whether it's a low-resolution photo or a high-quality digital print since both would look smooth due to the large number of pixels used per square inch. \n \n Now that we've explained those two different ways of displaying images lets move on...","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":28}

Well here\u2019s how you could make sure everyone stays warm enough even without having access to air-conditioners.    Room Heaters  A good way would be by installing some portable heaters like oil filled radiators (which don\u2019t consume too many electricity) into every single cubicle\/work station within...   If this method seems expensive,...    Another option might be getting hold of a small space heater....    You may also try out infrared heaters but these tend to dry out the skin very quickly..     Make sure not to use anything electrical near flammable materials!    Furniture  Try arranging everything neatly together instead of leaving them scattered across different corners of the room.  This will ensure maximum coverage against the cold.  Also place carpets over hardwood floors wherever possible.  Remember - carpeted areas retain heat better than bare wood surfaces do!  Lighting  Darker colors absorb less light compared to lighter ones.  So go ahead and paint those walls black \u2013 it\u2019s actually quite trendy nowadays anyway!!  And remember to turn off unnecessary lights when you\u2019re done working.  It\u2019ll save energy and money both!!!

This can only happen when you've successfully caught the ball being thrown at you by another member of the opposite team.     There are many ways to play this game but here we present our version which involves four teams playing against each other simultaneously using a regulation sized basketball court divided into three equal sections called end zones.   Each team consists of seven players including a captain whose job is to direct his\/her team mates throughout the match.   All matches consist of five periods lasting ten minutes per period except for the final where there'll just be three periods instead.   You may choose whichever number of players you'd like to include within these limits however it's recommended that you use between six and eight players per team so long as everyone plays equally well.

This article provides information regarding how to treat a Bartholin cyst at home before seeking medical attention; however, it's important to know what tests need to take place so proper care can begin immediately afterwards:   Your physician should perform a physical exam including pelvic exams to check for lumps around the vulva and labia majora.    A laboratory test might also be performed to rule out other conditions like infections or tumors.     Ultrasound imaging could be used to confirm whether you're dealing with a Bartholin cyst rather than another type of mass.","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":188}

{"text":"Cobra yoga poses can be done anywhere at any time.  You don't need special equipment; all you'll need is some open space where you're not likely to get knocked over while practicing this advanced posture.   If you'd like to practice outside of class but aren't quite ready yet, try performing cobra indoors first before moving outdoors (or vice versa). The most common place people perform cobra is during their warm-ups prior to beginning an actual workout routine.    This will help prepare them physically and mentally for what lies ahead.  It also helps improve flexibility throughout... Lie flat on your stomach facing upwards towards the ceiling.... Draw your shoulder blades gently apart,... Bend your neck backward until it's almost touching the floor. ...  Exhale deeply through pursed lips.  Inhale again when you've reached peak height.  Repeat 3-5 times per set.  Don't forget about breathing!   Do 2-3 sets total.  Rest between sets 1-2 minutes.  Practice regularly!  Be patient.  Always listen to your body's signals. .    To do this:  Stand straight with your arms raised above your head.  Turn one foot 45 degrees outward.  Rotate your torso 90 degrees counterclockwise around your hip joint.  Bring your arm opposite your turned leg behind your back.  Extend your free hand upward along side your bent knee.  Continue rotating your torso clockwise 180 degrees.  Return to center.  Repeat 10-12 times per set.  Do 2 sets total.  Rest 1 minute between sets.  Try these exercises once every 3-4 days after warming up.  They'll strengthen your core which makes cobra easier to hold longer without straining too much.  These movements should feel natural and easy--don't force anything.  Focus only on feeling good rather than trying to achieve perfection immediately.  For example,  if you find it difficult to keep your elbows tucked under your ribs, simply bring them closer instead of forcing them further inward.  As long as they're still pointing downwards, they won't interfere with the movement itself.  In fact, they'll actually make it look better because it'll give you something else to focus on besides just holding the pose correctly.  It's okay to cheat here since we're talking about improving our technique anyway.  Just remember to always return to correct positioning whenever possible.","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":206}

You may choose to hire professional movers because you don't feel confident handling such a big project alone,    but there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t handle much of the heavy lifting yourself.    In fact, it\u2019s often cheaper than paying someone else to do it!    Moving companies charge based upon volume rather than weight, which means that they\u2019ll bill more money simply because something takes up space.    For example, a dresser that\u2019s only half-full might cost twice as much to ship compared to another identical dresser that's completely full.    To save money when shipping bulky items, consider renting a storage unit until after you've moved.    Then fill it with books, clothing, toys etc. instead of sending those items along with your household goods.    Another option would be to ask friends or relatives living nearby to hold onto certain items while you move.    When choosing a mover, check online reviews thoroughly.    Ask around among people whose recent moves were handled by various local firms.    Check references too.    Never pay anything upfront unless you know exactly whom you\u2019re dealing with.    Keep in mind that reputable movers won\u2019t require payment until they've completed the job.    There are numerous websites dedicated solely to helping consumers locate qualified movers; here are two examples:  http:\/\/www.movingreviews.com\/find-a-moving-company\/   https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com Once you\u2019ve found a few potential candidates,...","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":308}

You should also consider getting professional cleaning done on your feather pillows every three years so that they're kept fresh and hygienic.

For example, you could use a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub away stains around seams. Make sure there is no loose fabric sticking up at... Place 2 pillows inside the washing machine along with 1\u20442\u00a0\u00a0c (120\u00a0ml) (2\u20443\u00a0\u00a0tsp) liquid dish soap. The amount of soap you'll need depends on how dirty your pillows are; start small and add more later if necessary. Avoid using regular dishwashing soap because its high suds may cause the feathers to clump together when wet. A mild detergent like Woolite Laundry Stain Remover works best since it won't strip color off of the pillows' covers. To avoid damaging the feathers, set your washing machine's temperature setting to \"Delicate\" instead of \"Hot\". Then select \"Drain & Spin Cycle Only\" rather than \"Washing\".

To start shuffling, place both hands over top of the entire pack of cards, then rub them back-and-forth against each other while moving forward across the table.  Keep doing this motion until you've moved past halfway into the pack; once you've reached the middle portion of the pack, switch directions again - now move backward instead of forwards.  Then repeat this process several times until every single card feels smooth when touched.  Once finished, lay the whole pack flat side-down onto the tabletop and mix everything up using only your fingers.

It has been praised for its graphics, soundtracks (both original music composed specifically for SSBM), characters' designs, story mode, online play modes, multiplayer options, and more.   The gameplay itself was revolutionary when released on GameCube back in 2002 -  players could now control their character using analog sticks instead of directional buttons only.    This made movement much smoother than ever seen before; however, this new feature came along with some problems too.     In order to make up for these issues, Nintendo added several features such as:    *The ability to hold down special moves like forward smash until they were fully charged.        *A \"special meter\" which would fill overtime while holding certain attacks.        *New ways to recover health after taking damage including items and healing stages.        *More advanced controls allowing for better precision movements.      These additions helped improve upon the already great mechanics found within the first installment of the series.

Here are just ten ways to get started using this powerful tool. \n \n 1.) Gather Real World Data \n \n \n \n Have your students gather information about something happening right now - whether it's news related like elections, sports games, weather forecasts etc.. Or perhaps they're studying geography? They could look at earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes erupting, traffic jams, accidents, protests, riots, natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, wildfires, droughts, forest fires, snowstorms, ice storms, thunderstorms, heat waves, cold spells, wind gusts, hail storms, mudslides, land slides, avalanches, volcanic eruptions, solar flares, space launches, moon phases, sunsets, sunrises, eclipses, auroras borealis, meteor showers, lunar cycles, comets passing through Earth's orbit, meteoroids striking the atmosphere, asteroids approaching our planet's surface, satellites being launched into space, spacecraft flying past us, rocket blasts off, rockets returning back down to earth, astronauts walking on the Moon, Mars rovers exploring the Red Planet, Jupiter moons, Saturn rings, Pluto dwarf planets, Neptune blue oceanic clouds, Uranus red coloring, Venus bright lightening, Mercury dark nights, Milky Way galaxy clusters, galaxies moving away from each other, black holes swallowing everything in sight, gravitational lensing effects, quasars emitting huge amounts of energy, gamma ray bursts exploding across the sky, pulsar radio signals coming from distant stars, supernovae explosions, star formation, galactic winds blowing dust particles towards nearby stars, interstellar medium consisting mostly of hydrogen gas, nebulae glowing brighter than most stars, infrared radiation emitted by hot plasma surrounding young stellar objects, cosmic rays streaming outward from supermassive black holes located deep within active galactic nuclei, or maybe they're looking at animals migrating seasonally? \n \n Whatever you're teaching, have your students collect real-time data via Twitter feeds. You may want to assign specific hashtags and\/or keywords to track during certain times throughout the day\/night\/morning\/afternoon depending upon what's going on.

Boots: They provide protection against cold water temperatures and sharp objects like rocks and branches.       Ropes: These range widely based on preference and budget.

Change Passwords Regularly  Changing your passwords regularly helps keep hackers off your system.

This guide aims to give you information as well as practical tips so that you get back what's rightfully yours.   The first step towards getting your stuff back is to consider how much longer you'd want this person around if they didn't own anything from before the relationship started.    You need to think carefully whether it's worth it to keep trying to work together amicably - even though you've broken up - just because there might be something here that's important enough to you both to save.     It would also be helpful to know where all your possessions currently lie;  do you have them stored somewhere else?   Are they being held by friends?  Do you have duplicates elsewhere?\nOnce you've decided exactly what you want...and don't want,...you'll probably find yourself wondering why he hasn't handed everything back already....or maybe he's done but now wants more!  It's very common for people to take items belonging to each other during relationships without thinking twice about it;  sometimes these items are gifts received while others are simply 'borrowed'.  But once the relationship ends many questions arise regarding ownership of such items.  In order to avoid future arguments, it's best to establish clearly beforehand whose belongings are whose.  Here are some suggestions:-    Make sure you always write down serial numbers wherever possible.  Take photographs of every item you buy jointly throughout the course of the relationship.  Keep receipts whenever buying new items together.  Write lists of joint purchases made online.  Don't leave personal effects lying around unattended!","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":460}

These are available online at: http:\/\/www.usacatholicschoolbooks.com\/easter\/calendar-of-easter-dates-1900-2050.html     Step 2: Determine the last digit of the year code. Add up the digits of the year until they equal four. Then multiply them times ten. Subtract these figures from the total number of days since Jan 1st, 1900. The remaining number should be divisible by 7. (For example, 2020 would give you:  2020 - 19 x 10 - 9 = 21 - 190 - 90 = 11 - 210 = -1)  Note that there were no leap years between 1901 and 1930; therefore, their codes remain unchanged compared to those used before 1950.

{"text":" If you can't do either, you can learn an instrument, or take singing lessons. Bass is a good one to learn, since it's not too hard for most songs. Singing lessons could be costly, but it's worth it if you really want to start a band, right?;\n, Use a name that sounds cool, or means something to you. Once you actually have a band, discuss the name, because it's usually the whole band who chooses the name. You don't want to be accused of having all the fun, because if you argue with your band, you may as well just give up.\n\n, Make sure it's okay with the head teacher, or whoever it is in charge of that kind of thing. Putting the notices on a music department notice board is good, since people interested in music are going to be looking at it. Consider putting \"band practice\" or \"band auditions\" in large, bold font to attract the reader's attention. It's all advertising, right? Would you stop to read an advert if it hadn't caught your eye? Make the notice as big and bright as possible.\n\n, If you have an argument with your friend or split up with your girlfriend\/boyfriend, you'll be screwed, especially if they played a big part like vocals or lead guitar, because rock isn't rock without a guitarist, right?\n\n, If they can hardly play drums and you need a drummer, don't just ask the first person available, you can live without a drummer for a while, so long as you have a good bassist and a (optional) metronome to practice with, you'll be fine. If the opportunity comes along, great, get in there and seize your chance, but if not, you'll probably just have to get on with the band.\n\n, If no one is what you're looking for, make the deadline a little longer, but if you find all the right people, lucky you! Take down the notices or modify them to say that all the places are taken. Here is a common mistake that a lot of people make when forming a band:they only use the people who look the part. Obviously portraying the band's image in a good way is mandatory, but work on that later, why choose looks over talent? If that guy with heavy eyebrows is a drum prodigy, why choose the guy with lovely golden curls when he's an average, maybe even below average, drummer?\n\n, Yes, that means reading and researching. Sorry! But you didn't expect to just start writing songs and be amazing, did you? Most songs go like this:\n\n\nVerse 1\nBridge (optional)\nChorus\nVerse 2\nChorus\nBridge (optional)\nChorus (repeated two to four times)\n\n, You can start off by covering songs of your favorite artists, or artists who are similar to you, or you can start writing right now. It's better to start writing straight away, because then you can only get better and better. It's good to cover some songs too though, especially is you've got writers block. It happens to all of us, even huge songwriters can get stuck. To write a song, think of a \"story line\". Maybe something that's happened to you that made you angry, upset, or happy. It's a good idea to not make the song scream this out, but making the song based around the event makes the listener intrigued (that's why they go on the Internet and find out what the meanings are of their favorite songs). It's also a lot easier if you and the band sit together and brainstorm ideas, then you can all share experiences and therefore making songwriting a little easier because you might have a great experience but it could be painfully difficult to write about.\n\n, Write down, on separate pieces of paper so you don't get confused, all the emotions, thoughts, and bits of memory that come through when you think about your experience. This could be a bad example, but let's just pretend for a minute that a few years ago you went on, say, the world's highest, scariest roller coaster. Think about what you would remember the most. Was it when you were getting on and you were scared stupid, or when you got off. Yep, you guessed it- getting on, because you were so scared it sticks out in your mind and you'll probably never forget it.\n\n, Now you've got some lines! It's much easier to start off with a chorus, so now all the main work is done. If you sing it and it sounds good and you can't get it out of your head, great! You've successfully created a catchy chorus. And what's the thing that most people remember about their favorite songs? That's right; the chorus.\n\n, It might take a while to get it fit into a tune, but again, if it sounds good, you've hit the nail on the head. It doesn't matter if all the lines make sense, but they should be more or less related. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of making things rhyme for the heck of it. The basic \"two lines rhyme, then the next two rhyme with a different ending\" is good. Even words that rhyme only a little (Manage me I'm a mess\/ Turn a page, I'm a book half unread- All Time Low - Weightless) work well.\n\n, This probably the easiest part of composing a song, but putting actual layers in the song is sometimes devilishly hard. Where should we put a dramatic pause? Or guitar riff? Is the lead guitarist going to do a solo? Should there be a part where there is no background music and then there is a line sung A Capella? How is the drum beat going to go? More importantly- how is the bassline going to go? What guitar tune should we put in the back? All huge questions, all difficult to answer, but it only comes with time. Sit down with the band and discuss the songs on by one. Ask your fellow bandmates to write down anything that they come up with, whether it be in Chemistry class, while practicing completed songs, or while playing a video game. Never leave it- always write down your ideas, because there's nothing worse than having an amazing idea, only to lose it in your mind. Meanwhile, focus on writing more songs and get some venues.\n\n, Obviously while you're just starting off don't expect people to let you just perform at the local gig. Start off with school assemblies. if people like you, awesome! You have fans! When you get pretty good, see if you can get a gig locally. Don't expect to be performing at Warped Tour! Hire a venue if you can. Maybe a city hall or anything available of a similar description. This might be a little costly, but make sure the people who come and watch you leave with some awesome music ringing in their ears. You want them to like you as soon as they look at you. So smile, have a stage presence and a sense of humor. Poke fun at yourself, saying things like you've never performed properly before and so excuse you if you're pretty bad. Put on a good show, and it will be worth the money you paid for the venue, because the people coming to watch you will have fun, but more importantly you'll have an insanely awesome time that you'll want to relive over and over again. If you're enjoying yourself, let the audience know it! Smile, dance crazily and look like you're having so much fun it's almost criminal.\n\n, Once you have your first gig, let people know about it. Put up posters on community notice board.\n\n, \"Yeah, I did. BUT...\" But nothing. If there's a \"but\" after they say \"yes\", you need to work on things. Get their opinion and work around that. If they say that they don't like the music, that is their choice. Tell yourself that if one person doesn't like it, then they're missing out!\n\n, It's hard at first to have ideas, but just keep trying! If you're passionate about your rock band, then you'll stick it out until the end. Being in a band makes you develop a superglue bond with your bandmates. You'll go through hell and high water with them. Remember when Bob Bryar left My Chemical Romance? Everyone was very sad, but look how far My Chemical Romance has come since then. Remember when Brownsound left Sum 41? It was awful! But Sum 41 carried on and made great music. What I'm saying is that even if one of the band leaves, it's not the end of the world (however it is a very good idea to have two guitarists so if one leaves, you have a backup), just struggle through it until you can find a replacement. The best bands have had some sort of struggle. My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way's drug problem- he got over it and he now feels squeaky clean. Josh and Zac Farro leaving Paramore - they got over it. Just remember to love your music and have a good time.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":500}
{"text":" Responsibility means doing the things that need to be done. It also means being honest and reliable. All of this plays into what parents will say when you ask them for a sleepover. If you want to be treated maturely, be mature., Whether you have your parents' trust or not, permission often depends on the night you're planning the sleepover for. If you want to sleepover on a school night, parents are usually unlikely to give you permission. On the other hand, a night during summer vacation will stand a better chance. If you want to increase the chances of getting permission, you should plan to spend the night when there's nothing happening the next day.\n\n\nSleepovers are generally harder to get permission for if they're co-ed. Moms and dads can be uncomfortable if boys and girls are sleeping over together, and may have firmer rules depending on their values., It can be very difficult and slow to rebuild if it is broken. In order to have trust between parent and child, you should be talking to them every day. Let them know about everything that's happening in your life. It's good to make this a normal thing for your relationship with them. This will help a lot more than your chances for sleepovers.\n\n, In your case, keeping up with homework and household chores will prove that you deserve to go out and let loose. If there's anything that needs to be done before you ask them make a point of doing it first. Don't let an unfinished chore be used against you when you ask to spend the night.\n\n, As unfair as it may seem, part of what depends on whether your parents give permission is the mood you're in when they ask. If they're already upset about something before you approach, it's almost guaranteed that they will say no. This is because they do not want to deal with any added stress.\n\n\nOne thing you might do is see what you can do to help your parents out before asking. That way, they'll be in a better mood, and you'll have proven yourself deserving in their eyes.\n\n, Asking your parents can be stressful depending on the kind of relationship you have with them, but it needs to be done calmly. Above all else, you need to say it in a way that isn't going to make it sound like a negative interaction. If you go into it with a pessimistic mindset, it's all the more likely your parents will deny you.\n\n\nIt can be good to offer a few details before asking the question. This can help avoid a quick 'no'. Say something like this: \"My friend is having her birthday tomorrow, and wanted to have a pizza sleepover to celebrate. Would it be okay if I went over there and spent the night tomorrow?\"\nSitting down next to them while you ask can be a helpful trick, as it will make them feel less rushed in their decision.\nIf possible, it's a good idea to ask the question a couple of days in advance. Parents are usually more likely to react positively to a request in advance, rather than a last-minute plan.\n\n, If parents are feeling nervous about letting their child out for the evening, giving them all the details will put them at ease.Giving them a run-down of the plans and things they may want to know will be a great help. Being honest and upfront about it will give you the highest chance of getting their permission. Here are some things you should tell them:\n\n\nWhere you'll be staying.\nWhether you're planning on leaving your friend's house at some point in the evening.\nWhat kind of parental supervision is expected. This is a big one.\nWhether anyone else will be the home. That includes siblings of your friend or other relatives.\nWhat your friend's family situation is like.\n\n, Even if you're going to a sleepover for the sake of having fun, there are a lot of extra benefits to a kid sleeping over. Letting your parents know the benefits can ease them into thinking it's a good thing for your upbringing. Try bringing up some of these if they're having a hard time budging:Children at sleepovers learn new social skills. They have to be flexible in a new environment.\nYou're going to get a fresh perspective of another family during a sleepover.Try not to make this one sound like you want to escape from your own family!\nA child being out of the house gives parents a chance to relax.\nSleepovers can be an enjoyable treat once in a while.\n\n, Ask about the main issue that they're worried about, and ask what can be done to solve it. Keep your focus on finding a solution, rather than letting yourself get angry.\n\n\nPopping a question about this should be straightforward and calm. Say something like: \"I understand that you may be worried over me going out tonight. What in particular is bothering you? Maybe we can find a way to fix it.\"\n\n, Contact info is important, both for the child and the parents. Your parents will want to be able to get a hold of you no matter what. Even if they never call the number it will put them at ease to have a number they can call if they don't hear anything from you.This should be the home phone of the house you're staying at, or the cell number of your friend's parents.\n\n\nDon't give fake numbers. Even if you manage to make it out this time, messing around with your parents will ruin their trust and your chances for future sleepovers.\n\n, Parents can feel helpless if their child if sleeping somewhere else. If you replan the sleepover to happen at your place, you can stand a chance of making things work. That way, you'll have time with a friend, and your parents will still feel like they're in control.Some parents are automatically against any friends staying the night at their home, so don't take this as a surefire alternative plan.\n\n, It can be risky to ask for a sleepover once you're already there, but impromptu plans do happen. If you want a sneakier approach, you can ask to go over for dinner, as dinners are usually easier to get permission for. After dinner, you can get relaxed and call up your parents to ask. Sometimes, a parent will have an easier time giving permission for something that is already happening. If you choose this however, you should be prepared for disappointment. Some parents won't take kindly to you trying to pull a fast one under their noses.\n\n\nIt's a good idea to pack your sleepover things just in case.\nIn order for this to work out, your parents will probably have to know the family you're staying with well. It also helps if you have had successful sleepovers at that place before.\n\n, Parents like set plans. Give them a rough idea of when you'll be back. That way, they'll be able to relax for the time being. Set plans are a good thing, as they help to fight stress and worry.\n\n\nAt the same time, you should be flexible with when they can pick you up. A lot of adults have a lot going on throughout their day, so it should be up to them when you are picked up the next day., If you tell them you're going to do something and do something else, you risk ruining trust. Especially if you're not used to spending the night out, it's important to show them you can be trusted.\n\n, Part of your parents' decision depends on what they think of the friend you want to sleepover with. In most cases however, their ultimate concern is your safety. They want to make sure you'll be taken care of. That's where the friend's parents come in. If your parents can put a name to a face, it will set their minds at ease when you ask to sleepover., If your parents don't already know your friend, it's a good idea to put a name to a face. By introducing them, your parents can see that your friend isn't near as bad as they may have feared. Even unruly friends tend to be well-behaved when other parents are around.\n\n\nYour parents will probably be trying to decide the sort of danger your friend may put your in. If your friend is known to be belligerent and irresponsible, you'll have a very hard time convincing them that it's a good idea to stay the night.\n\n, By taking a leave from your own home, you need to take responsibility for yourself. That includes knowing to leave if you don't want to stay anymore.If you feel sick or don't feel comfortable spending the night anymore, call up your parents. Even if it's late, your parents will probably be happy that you decided to call rather than sit through something unpleasant. If anything, it will prove to them that you can be trusted to call out a bad situation when you see one.\n\n, Keeping your parents up to date with everything will make them feel more at ease. When you're either picked up or get home, talk to your parents a bit about how the sleepover was. What sort of stuff did you get up to? Was it fun? What was your friend's family like to be around? All of these can help show your parents that a sleepover is a healthy activity.\n\n\nRemember: You don't just want to make this sleepover work. You also want to ensure future sleepovers. Making it a pleasant experience for everyone involved will make sure you have the highest chance of more sleepovers.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":501}
{"text":" Most card collectors use binders to keep their cards. A binder offers safety and an accessible showcase if you want to show your cards off to someone. You should prepare to buy a high-quality binder that's appropriate for displaying such high-value items. Boxes, on the other hand, offer more safety, but don't have the same readymade presentation. If you get a box, index card dividers will act as a trusty partition between categories.Each of these index partitions will help you categorize the cards within each box. Sticky tabs may be used to the same effect in binders.\n\n\nIf your cards are too valuable to be worth storing in basic binders, it may be worth it to buy high-protection plastic sleeves for each of the cards.This will reduce smudging and tear risks. Toploaders are recommended for the most hardcore, high-value collectors.Depending on the size of your collection, you may need multiple binders and boxes. If this is the case, you should try to turn each binder\/box into a broad category.;\n, Most card brands offer prescribed categories. You may choose to follow these categories if you want. Otherwise, you can order them numerically (if applicable) or alphabetically. A numerical or alphabetical ordering system can be used within each category as well.\n\n\nSports cards might be categorized by player type, team, year, set and the sport itself. Some collector choose to specialize in specific teams. Collecting all of the cards in a given team will increase your collection's value.\nPokemon cards might be categorized by the particular card type or its rareness. Other \"character\" cards may be sorted according to the unique categories of that given product.\nFor duplicate cards, you can place them side by side. For less valuable cards in binders, a common trick is to make the cards share the same sleeve. It is helpful to make a note somewhere that the duplicate exists, as it won't be readily visible from the start.\n\n, Place each card in its assigned pile. Keep a healthy distance of space between certain piles. If you are dealing with enough cards, the piles may get big enough to the point where separate piles eventually merge.\n\n, Once you have your card piles sorted out, it's time to list the categories listed in your box or binder. With a permanent marker, neatly list the category on a tab and place it at the beginning of a given category. It helps to have all of your categories planned out before you get to this stage. That way, you can allot enough space to each section in your storage.\n\n\nThough it may seem obvious, you should make a point of marking the box or binder itself. If you're storing them in your attic, they can get lost amidst a number of other things.\nThere's a tendency for collectors to scribble the categories. While you obviously don't need to make the lettering perfect, it is a good idea to ensure the writing is legible for anyone who might see it. Furthermore, giving your lettering some creative flair might add to the aesthetic value of your collection.\nIt's a good idea to count out the number of cards in each category before marking your sections. That way, you can give each category ample space in your binder.\n\n, Put on a show or listen to music while you arrange the cards by type. This will make your time feel more worthwhile. Make a point of placing the cards in carefully. If your cards have a monetary worth associated with them, the slightest crease or tear could ruin their value.\n\n, If you're a passionate collector, you'll always be on the lookout for new additions. With this in mind, it's good to organize your binder with future finds in mind. Leave some extra space at the end of each category to accommodate for this.\n\n\nIf you're ordering within each category itself, you can save yourself organizing in the future by taking account of the cards you still need. If there's a limited amount needed to complete a collection, leave an open space where that card will eventually go. This also gives you a visual reference as to how complete your collection currently is.\nIf your collection expands beyond the capacity of your given storage, it may be time to reorganize the collection. Luckily, with your cards already in their proper categories, reorganizing will only take a fraction of the original time it took to get things together.\n\n, With that in mind, finding a spot where they'll be safe and untouched is paramount. A temperate basement or attic is a good place to store basic hobby cards for the long-term. More valuable cards should be kept somewhere heat and moisture controlled, like an office. Renting out a moisture-regulated lockup to keep your cards in is recommended if they're sufficiently valuable. If you want quick access to your collection, a filing cabinet is a good idea. Binders are more frail than boxes, and should be placed in a storage box if you're storing them for a long time.\n\n\nMake sure your basement or attic is free from excess issues like heat or moisture. If this is the case, you should store it somewhere more temperate, such as a bedroom closet.\nIf you have to store your cards in a damp or hot area, you should invest in rigid snap-cases. This will protect your cards from most of the environmental issues. They can run up a cost if you need enough of them, but they're worth it if your cards are sufficiently valuable.If your collection carries some significant monetary weight, it's not unreasonable to lock it up in a safe.\n\n, While a digital representation of your card collection may be redundant for smaller collections, it becomes increasingly useful once your collection crosses over into needing multiple boxes or binders.\n\n\nMake sure to include the essential card data, including the name, category, and estimated monetary value. Sports cards will indicate the maker of the card, the year, sport, player name, number, condition and whether or not the card itself is signed. Other card systems (such as \"character\" cards) should be catalogued according to each of that brands specific properties.\nThere are software programs specifically designed for card-collecting. If a spreadsheet is too impersonal for your needs, you should look up a card organizing program., This offers a shorthand method of referring to certain cards. Again, this is a card-keeping method that only really makes sense if your collection gets really big.\n\n, A lot of things factor into a card's market worth, including condition, rarity, desirability and historical significance. If you aren't sure of the values themselves, you can show them to trading card specialist. For a fee, a specialist will appraise the condition and rarity of a card and give you a rough estimate of its worth on the market.\n\n, Having more than one card isn't usually seen as a particularly desirable, but a card copy can come in handy if you're trading with other collectors. With this in mind, it's a good idea to set aside the cards you want to trade. At a convention, you may run into another collector that has a card you want. By trading your duplicates for cards you want, you'll be able to get a solid use out of them.\n\n, The longer you let your collection grow unchecked, the more harrowing it will be to ultimately get it in order.If you're starting out with a trading card collection, it's never too early to start sorting them out by type. As time goes on, your categories will get more elaborate. However, even a basic set of 5-10 cards can be arranged in a way that makes logical sense.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":502}

{"text":" Research has shown that men are more likely than women to take jobs in which pay is dependent on outperforming their peers, and you probably know from personal experience that men tend to be more interested in sports (playing or watching).A lot of men act this way because they thrive on competition, and take satisfaction in having skills or traits that dominate others. If you're playing against him in a game, don't be surprised if his mood suddenly turns intense and merciless if he starts losing. Accept it with good humor and move on.\n\n\nEncourage his competitive hobbies. You'll notice that a lot of stereotypical men's activities - such as gaming, watching or playing sports, and extreme sporting - are focused on some element of competition. Because succeeding in competition can be more important to men, support the activities that can bring your guy this sort of satisfaction in a relatively safe way.;\n, Eyesight is one of the strongest senses, and processing all the things you may see takes up a large portion of day-to-day cerebral processing. Men, however, are even more apt than women to respond to visual cues.As a result, you might find that men prefer to view a map to understand directions over hearing the directions read, or they might insist that they need to see a problem in order to fix it. Try not to be annoyed at this tendency, and accept it as an inborn trait he may not know how to control.\n\n\nDon't be too offended if he looks at other women. Being more attentive to visual stimulus means that a guy might be more inclined to look - or even stare - at attractive people. But don't get bent out of shape - just because he looks at a woman in a low-cut shirt doesn't mean he automatically wants to sleep with her. These small glances are generally harmless, and are more of a reflex than an indication of a doomed relationship.\n\n, Research indicates that this difference begins in childhood, when little girls form bonds by sharing secrets and discussing problems while boys bond over shared activities and interests . If you expect your boyfriend or husband to be like your best female conversation partner, only better, you might be surprised - men tend not to build strong relationships through conversation, and they switch topics more frequently than women do.In addition to this, men also don't make as much eye contact when they're talking to someone. Instead, their gazes wander to other objects in the immediate area as they talk.\n\n\nInstead of punishing him for this difference and complaining that he never listens to you, choose your battles. If you really want to discuss an important topic with a man, frame it in a way that doesn't leave him guessing. Say, \"It's important to me that we talk about this, and it would mean a lot to me if you could listen closely.\" If he cares about you, he'll make the extra effort to up his participation to your level.\nExpect to hear a solution. Another side effect to the way men have conversations is that they tend to focus on how to fix a problem. If you just want a man to offer you comfort and reassurance instead of instructing you on what to do, tell him that at the beginning of the conversation. Remember that he's trying to help you find a solution because he cares, and that's what he thinks caring people do in a conversation, not because he wants to boss you around.\n\n, Think of the old stereotype of a husband who has no idea what he's done to enrage his wife. It's possible that he's not just being deliberately clueless - he might genuinely have no idea why she's upset, or whether she's upset at all. Because women have more developed limbic systems, they're better at classifying and reading emotions, a skill that was useful when women were primarily in charge of maintaining social connections in ancient cultures. Men, on the other hand, lag behind women in studies of how the sexes identify and control emotions.Don't expect him to read your mind. If you're upset at a man, tell him in a way that's as calm and reasonable as possible. Once he's aware of how you feel, he can take measures to remedy the problem. If you don't tell him, though, you can't necessarily count on him to pick up your cues.\nGive him space. Because men aren't accustomed to discussing their personal problems at length with a buddy, you might find that they tend to process such problems on their own. If a man shuts down when you try to discuss his personal issues, back off gracefully and give him space to get over it. Most men will let you know if they want to talk about it.\n\n, Studies show that men in seemingly platonic relationships with women are more likely to be attracted to their female friends, and also more likely to have the misguided belief that the women harbor sexual feelings for them. Though women have also shown signs of having sexual feelings for their male friends, they are more likely to back off when they know the men are in relationships; men are less deterred when their female friends have boyfriends and still show signs of wanting to pursue them.This doesn't mean, however, that every male friend you have really has a crush on you, deep down.\n\n, Though men and women may be completing the same task or inhabiting the same office, men and women take a different approach to getting work done. Men tend to be more focused on completing a specific task while women are more focused about the process used to get the job done; women tend to ask more questions while men have a harder time listening. Both sexes, however, do feel that the oppose sex is not as sensitive to their needs in the workplace.Men and women tend to react differently in the workplace in terms of stress, too. While women may openly express concern about a failed project, men may retreat and seek solitude in the face of failure.\nWomen and men also seek appreciation differently. Women are happier when they are complimented on a group task, while men like to be singled out.\n\n, Though you may be convinced that your boyfriend, male friend, or male co-worker would want to sleep with every woman on the planet in an ideal world, that is not the case. Though men may look at the women around them and can have wandering eyes, they are still selective when the time comes to actually sleep with someone.\n\n\nIf you're convinced that your boyfriend really wants to sleep with all women, then why are you together? If this is really a problem in your relationship because of who he is, then it's one thing, but if it's because you think it's because he's a man, then you have to rethink your ideas.\nSure, you may have the occasional sleazy male friend. But remember that men may want to brag about how many women they like to sleep with to look tough; that doesn't mean they are interested in following through.\n\n, You may think that your boyfriend hates it when it's your turn to pick the location and event for date night, but that's not actually true. Sure, your boyfriend may moan and groan when you make him watch Love Actually for the tenth time, but the truth is, he likes doing what you want to do because, well, it's what makes you happy.\n\n\nRemind yourself that if your boyfriend really didn't want to do something, he just wouldn't do it. And the same goes for you.\n\n, Think of Tony Soprano: a tough guy on the outside and a big, soft, sensitive bear on the inside. It's true that women may like to be more open with their feelings and to talk more, but that doesn't mean that men aren't sensitive, don't have the ability to get hurt, and don't know how to sympathize or empathize. Men may be more resistant to showing emotion, but that doesn't mean that they don't have feelings that are just as big as yours.\n\n\nMen are not cavemen who are only obsessed with the basic necessities: food, sex, and sleep. Get this thought out of your mind.\n\n, Sure, men may be more likely to think often about sex than women, especially if they're teenagers, but that doesn't mean that they only have one thing on their minds at all times. Just like anyone else, men spend time thinking about their friends, family, hopes and dreams, and career prospects. If a hot woman in heels walks by, then sure, they may be momentarily distracted, but that doesn't mean that the inside of his mind looks like the XXX section of your local video store.\n\n, When it comes to looks, men and women can both be superficial. You may think that men only care about what a girl's body looks like, adding bonus points if she actually has a nice face, but that is not the case when men get serious about a girl. Don't think that all you have to do to impress a man is to hit the gym, put on the eyeliner, and wear tight pants. You have to impress him with your charm, your brains, and your ability to have a good conversation.\n\n\nSure, some men are more obsessed with looks than they should be. But you can say the same for women.\n\n, You may think that men are known for being cheaters; and who can forget the Tiger Woods scandal? However, both men and women are capable of cheating, even if women tend to look for more of an emotional connection while men look for the physical connection. Don't think that your guy is likely to cheat on you just because he's a guy; if he does, it's because he's looking for a connection outside the relationship.That doesn't mean that there aren't some real scumbags out there. But women could be scumbags, too.\n\n, You may think that any man you meet is terrified of commitment and wants to run for the hills as soon as you say the phrase, \"I think you should meet my parents.\" In reality, men are just as likely to commit as women. You're just thinking of the 20% of men who are true commitment-phobes. Just remember that there are plenty of women who are equally afraid of getting serious with someone.\n\n\nIf your current love interest is afraid to commit to you, then don't tell yourself it's just because he's \"a typical man.\" There are lots of other reasons for why a man may not want to commit, such as a lack of experience or the pain he suffered in a past relationship.\n\n, Sure, men might be intimidated by strong women -- if you're Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey. But in general, men are actually attracted to assertive women who know what they want and are comfortable with going after it. Don't try to act girly, clueless, or giggly just to impress a guy. If you want a man to take you seriously, then you have to show him your full potential.\n\n\nBeing strong means being confident. And everyone is attracted to confidence.\n\n, If you want to understand men on an even deeper level, then you should try to understand the male ego.\n\n, Mastering this process could improve your relationship in the long run.\n\n, This can help you understand the thought process of a man who is in it for the long haul.\n\n, This is a challenging aspect of understanding men.\n\n, If you have a better sense of how to improve your relationship with your boyfriend, you'll have a better understanding of men.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":510}

{"text":" Assertive communication carries respect for the feelings, needs, wants, and opinions of others. An assertive communicator avoids infringing upon the rights of others, while asserting their own, seeking compromise in the process. Assertive communication utilizes actions and words to express boundaries of needs and wants in a calm fashion, while conveying a message of confidence., The verbal cues that indicate assertive communication convey respect, sincerity and firmness. These cues might include:Firm, relaxed voice\nFluent and sincere\nAppropriate volume for situation\nCooperative and constructive\n\n, Just like verbal cues, non-verbal communication conveys assertive behavior and can indicate respect, sincerity and confidence. Non-verbal features might include:Receptive listening\nDirect eye contact\nOpen body stance\nSmiling when pleased\nFrowning when angry\n\n, An assertive person will naturally gravitate towards certain thought patterns that indicate their confidence and respect for others. These thoughts might include:\u201cI won\u2019t be taken advantage of, or attack another person.\u201d\n\u201cI will stand up for myself in a respectful manner.\u201d\n\u201cI will express myself directly and openly.\u201d\n\n, Assertiveness can often be incorrectly confused with aggression. Aggressiveness lacks respect for others. It is a complete disregard for the needs, feelings, wants, opinions, and sometimes even the personal safety of other people. Aggressive communication can often be identified by angry and\/or demanding behavior, self-promotion, and manipulation.\n\n\nVerbal features of aggressive communication might include: sarcastic or condescending remarks, blaming, shouting, threats, boasting, or the use of put-downs.\nNonverbal features of aggressive communication might include: intruding upon others\u2019 personal space; fist-clenching, crossed arms, scowling, or staring down another person.\nThoughts associated with aggressive communication might include: \u201cI feel powerful, and will get others to do my bidding,\" \"I am in control of other people,\" or \"I refuse to be vulnerable.\u201d\n\n, Silence and assumption are the hallmarks of the passive communication style. Passive communicators often lack of respect for themselves, disregarding their own opinions, feelings, needs, and desires. Passive communication places one\u2019s own needs and desires below those of others. Passivity takes away one\u2019s power and allows others to decide the outcomes of situations.:\n\n\nVerbal features of passive communication might include: hesitancy, quiet, self-dismissal, or self put-downs.\nNon-verbal features of passive communication might include: averting the gaze or looking down, slouched posture, crossed arms, or covering the mouth with hand.\nThoughts associated with passive communication might include: \u201cI don\u2019t count,\" or \u201cPeople will think poorly of me.\u201d\n\n, From early childhood, our behaviors are adapted to fit responses received from our environment, families, peers, coworkers, and authority figures. Communication styles, such as passiveness, assertiveness, and aggression, can be extensions of cultural, generational, and situational influences. Assertiveness is much more valued in Western societies.\n\n\nOlder generations may find it more difficult to act assertively. Men were once taught that emotional expression was a sign of weakness, while women were taught that stating their own needs and opinions conveyed messages of aggression. Sometimes, it can even be difficult for us to discern which behaviors are appropriate to use in different situations., It is important not to blame yourself if you do not understand how to communicate assertively. Other types of communication styles, such as passiveness and aggression, can be parts of a vicious cycle. You can break this cycle by learning new assertive ways of thinking and behaving.If your family taught you to place the needs of others before yourself as a child, it may be difficult for you to assert yourself.\nIf your family or peer group handled conflict by yelling and arguing, you may have learned to deal with conflict accordingly.\nIf your social group believed that negative emotions should be concealed, or if your have ever been ignored or ridiculed for expressing these types of feelings, then you may have learned not to communicate negative emotions.\n\n, In order to learn how to communicate assertively, it is important that you learn how to effectively manage your emotions. For some, just gaining insight into their own emotional processes can be enough to help them change the way they communicate with others and enable them to express their emotions in a more assertive manner. Keeping a journal can be the best to get to the bottom of your behavior, by recording situations and asking specific questions that relate to assertiveness., Write down situations that trigger your emotions. Stick to facts and try not to make any interpretations in this first step. For example, you may simply write, \u201cI asked my friend to go out to eat, and she said \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\n, Be honest about how you felt. Specify what emotions you were aware of at the time, and rate the intensity of each emotion on a scale from 0 to 100 (not intense at all to extremely intense). Just give an estimate but be honest with yourself.\n\n, Note any physical symptoms you may have felt at the time. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d and \u201cWhat did I feel in my body?\u201d\n\n\nFor example, if someone ignored your phone call, maybe you felt sick to your stomach or tension in your shoulders.\n\n, These thoughts may be assumptions, interpretations, beliefs, values, and so forth. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d or \u201cWhat was going through my head?\u201d For instance, you may write down: \u201cI agreed to go out to eat when she asked me, so she should have said yes when I asked her,\u201d or \u201cSaying no was rude of her,\u201d or \u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to be my friend anymore.\u201d\n\n, Again using the 0 to 100 scale, rate the strength of your thoughts in the situation. Record a \u201c0\u201d if you didn\u2019t believe the thought, or a \u201c100\u201d if you believed it 100%. Then ask yourself, \u201cAm I thinking in a passive, assertive, or aggressive manner?\u201d Record your response to this question. Record any evidence for, or against, each thought. Evaluate whether there may be other ways to interpret the situation.\n\n, In order to find a more balanced and assertive manner of thinking and behaving, ask yourself, \u201cWhat would be a more assertive way of thinking or responding?\u201d\n\n, After you have evaluated the situation, revisit the intensity of your original emotions and the strength of your beliefs in the situation. Rate them again from 0 to 100.\n\n, Through the journaling exercise, you are likely to decrease the intensity of your emotions. Evaluate your emotions, thoughts, and reactions during different types of situations. If you continue to practice, you may begin to think and behave in a more assertive manner.\n\n, Assertiveness is a learned style of communication that allows for the confident expression of one\u2019s needs and feelings while, at the same time, remaining mindful of the opinions, wants, needs, and feelings of others. It is an alternative to behaving in a passive or aggressive manner. There are many benefits to learning how to communicating assertively:Strong and effective communication\nConfidence\nSelf-esteem enhancement\nGain respect of others\nImproves decision-making skills\nReduces stress of not having needs met\nEnables conflict resolution\nSelf-respect increases\nFeelings of being ignored or coerced replaced by feelings of being understood and in control of decisions\nTendency to be less depressedDecreased likelihood of substance abuse, Saying no can be difficult for many people. However, saying \u201cyes\u201d when you need to say \u201cno\u201d can lead to unnecessary stress, resentment, and anger toward others. When saying no, it can be helpful to keep in mind a useful set of guidelines:Keep it brief.\nBe clear.\nBe honest.\nFor example, if you don't have time to do a favor that you don't have time to do, you can simply say, \"I can't this time. Sorry to disappoint you, but I have too many things to do that day, and there's no room in my schedule.\"\n\n, When you are speaking with someone, remain calm and have respect for them. This will enable the other person to heed what you say and treat you with respect too.\n\n\nIt may help to breathe deeply if you start to feel upset. Doing so will initiate your body's calming process and help you stay in control.\n\n, Communication may seem like a simple task, however, much of what we attempt to communicate to others \u2013 and what is communicated to us \u2013 can often be misunderstood. This may cause frustration or conflict in our relationships with other people. When communicating with someone, state your feelings, wants, opinions, and needs in simple sentences. This will help the other person clearly understand what you\u2019re asking.For example, instead of speaking to a family member in long sentences full of hints and indirect statements, you can be brief and direct: \"I love when you call me just to talk! It's hard for me to have a long conversation during work hours, though. I'd appreciate it if you called during the evening instead.\"\n\n, \u201cI\u201d statements convey that you are willing to take responsibility for your own thoughts and behaviors. There are different types of \u201cI\u201d statements that are appropriate for a variety of situations:Basic assertion: This type of \u201cI\u201d statement can be used in everyday situations to make your needs known, or to give praise, information, or facts. Basic assertions can also be utilized in self-disclosure situations to ease anxiety and enable relaxation. It includes: \u201cI need to leave by 6 o\u2019clock,\u201d or \u201cI enjoyed your presentation.\u201d\n\nEmpathetic assertion: This particular \u201cI\u201d statement contains elements of recognition of another person\u2019s feelings, needs, or desires, as well as a statement of your own needs and desires. It can be used to indicate your sensitivity to another person\u2019s position, such as, \u201cI know you are busy, but I need your assistance.\u201d\n\nConsequence assertion: This is the strongest form of \u201cI\u201d statement, often used as a last resort assertion. It can be misinterpreted as aggressive if you are not careful to observe your non-verbal behavior. The consequence assertion informs another person of the penalties for not changing their behavior; usually in situations when someone is not considering the rights of others. An example would be a work situation when procedures or guidelines are not being followed: \u201cIf this happens again, I am left with no choice but to pursue disciplinary action. I would prefer to avoid that.\u201d\n\nDiscrepancy assertion: This type of \u201cI\u201d statement is used to point out a discrepancy between what has been previously agreed upon, and what is actually happening. It is used for clarifying misunderstandings and\/or contradictions in behavior. You might say, \u201cAs I understand, we agreed that Project ABC was our number one priority. Now you are asking me to allow more time for Project XYZ. I would like you to clarify which is now the top priority.\u201d\n\nNegative feelings assertion: This form of \u201cI\u201d statement is utilized in situations where you feel negative feelings toward another person (anger, resentment, hurt). It enables you to convey these feelings without making an uncontrolled outburst, and alerts the other party of the effects of their actions. You might say, \u201cWhen you procrastinate on your report, it involves my working over the weekend. I feel annoyed by this, so in the future I would like to receive it by Thursday afternoon.\u201d\n\n, Always remember when being assertive, your non-verbal communication is important. It is possible to think you are acting assertively when you are actually being passive or aggressive because you are not careful about your non-verbal communication style.\n\n\nKeep your voice calm and volume neutral\nMaintain good eye contact\nRelax your face and body position\n\n, Adopting assertive behavior takes time and practice so that it can become second nature to you. Practice having conversations in the mirror. Alternately, practice your conversation with your therapist or counselor.\n\n, It can be challenging to keep your emotions under control, which can affect the way we communicate. When we get stressed or upset, our bodies go into stress mode, which puts our bodies into a chemical and hormonal reaction to get ready for a perceived threat.The way you think in this state is different than the way you would think with a calm, clear, rational mind and body, making it more difficult for you to use your assertiveness techniques.Acknowledge when you have stress in your life. Make a list of the things that are contributing to your stressful state.\n\n, Relaxation techniques bring our bodies back to a balanced physiological state. For example, meditation has a calming effect on the brain that lasts well after your meditation session. This has a direct effect on the amygdala, the center in the brain responsible for emotional reasoning.Try to meditate every day for at least 5-10 minutes.Sit in a comfortable chair or on a pillow.\nClose your eyes and focus on sensations that you\u2019re having. Pay attention to what you feel with your body, what you hear, and what you smell.\nTurn your attention to your breathing. Inhale for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.\nWhenever your mind wanders, dismiss the thoughts without judgment and refocus your thinking on your breath.\nYou might add a mantra or metta, or a saying that uplifts you and gives you positive feelings, such as, \u201cMay I be peaceful,\u201d or \u201cMay I be happy.\u201dYou might also try a guided meditation, which helps you visualize relaxing imagery., When you are in a stressful situation, deep breathing can help reduce stress and help you think clearly. Take some deep breaths by slowly and deliberately inhaling and exhaling.\n\n\nSit comfortably in a chair with your arms and legs uncrossed, feet flat on the floor, and hands resting on your thighs. Gently close your eyes.\nBreathe in through your nose, observing the quality of the breath while inhaling and exhaling.\nSlowly lengthen each inhalation by smoothly deepening each breath down into your abdomen. Pause briefly, then note the smooth, steady breath released as you exhale.\nBegin counting the rhythm of your breaths. Inhale for 3 seconds. Exhale for 3 seconds. Maintain slow, even, and controlled breathing. Try not to speed up.\nUse this rhythm while breathing for 10-15 minutes\nWhen finished, gently open your eyes. Relax momentarily. Then, slowly rise from the chair.\n\n, If you\u2019re nervous about meditation or feel you don\u2019t have the time to practice it faithfully, the relaxation response can still be activated through progressive muscle relaxation.This technique activates the body\u2019s calming response and brings the body back into physiological balance by tensing and relaxing each muscle group in the body in progression. To practice progressive muscle relaxation in about 15-20 minutes per day:\n\n\nFind a comfortable position in a chair with your feet flat on the floor, your hands resting on your thighs, and your eyes closed.\nStart the exercise by clenching your fists, holding for 10 seconds. Then release, feeling the relaxation sensation for another 10 seconds. Repeat.\nTense your lower arm by bending your hand downward at the wrist, hold for 10 seconds. Release, and relax for another 10 seconds. Repeat.\nWork through the rest of your body, pausing to tense and relax each muscle group. Start with your upper arms, shoulders, neck, head, and face. Then continue with your chest, stomach, back, buttocks, thighs, calves and feet.\nWhen you\u2019ve worked through your entire body, sit for a few minutes to enjoy the sensation of feeling relaxed.\nStand slowly to avoid dizziness (blood pressure drops when relaxed) or tensing up again unexpectedly.\nIf you don\u2019t have 15-20 minutes to complete the entire exercise, you can practice on muscle groups that are noticeably tense.\n\n, Making decisions is part of being assertive. You are taking control of your life and making decisions that best suit you, rather than letting someone else make decisions for you or allow yourself to become swayed by someone else against your better judgment. By identifying the problem, you will be able to address critical elements that result in good decision-making. Niagara Region Public Health recommends using the IDEAL model:I \u2013 Identify the problem.\nD \u2013 Describe all possible solutions. These might include handling it yourself, asking for intervention from someone else, or doing nothing.\nE - Evaluate the consequences of each solution. Evaluate your feelings and needs to determine the best outcome for yourself.\nA - Act. Choose a solution and try it. Use \u201cI\u201d statements to express your feelings and needs.\nL - Learn. Did the solution work? Evaluate why or why not. If it didn\u2019t work, look at the other solutions on your list and work through them.\n\n, There may be multiple parties who will be impacted by a decision, but not all of them necessarily have to be involved with the decision-making. Get input from those who need to be involved.You should consider the other parties as you make your decision, but the final say will come from you.\n\n, All decisions are prompted by the need for some course of action. Take time to determine the purpose behind this course of action. This will ensure that the decision is the correct one.\n\n, Procrastination can be a major impediment to assertive decision-making. Don\u2019t leave the decision to the last minute or you may eliminate some of the possible solutions., Boundaries are the physical, emotional, and intellectual barriers that you create to protect yourself from harm. Healthy boundaries protect your personal space, self-esteem, and maintain your ability to separate your own feelings from those of others. Unhealthy boundaries increase your likelihood of exposure to being adversely affected by others feelings, beliefs, and behaviors., When you go into a conversation where you want to discuss your needs, it\u2019s important to know your boundaries beforehand. Having your boundaries at the forefront of your mind before a conversation will keep you from getting derailed and compromising your needs in the middle of a conversation because it's easier or helps you avoid conflict.\n\n\nFor example, establish a boundary with your boss of not working on the weekends or not working overtime without three days\u2019 notice. If you're talking to a friend, have a boundary of not picking her up at the airport again until she picks you up when you need a ride.\n\n, If you do not feel right doing something, then don't do it. It's okay to reject someone. Remember, for yourself, the most important person is you. If you don't respect your own desires, how can you expect others to?\n\n\nYou may think that being a people-pleaser will put you on people\u2019s good side, but unfortunately, an overabundance of generosity usually has the opposite effect on people.\nPeople only value the things they invest time\/energy\/money into, so if you\u2019re the one doing all the giving, your esteem for that person will skyrocket, but theirs for you will decline. Take a stand. People may resist at first \u2013 or even be shocked by your transformation \u2013 but in the end, they will respect you for it.\n\n, Don't be silent if you have something to say. Share your feelings freely: it's your right. Remember, there's nothing wrong in having an opinion. Just make sure you pick the right moment to state your needs. Make it clear that what you have to say is important and should be noticed.\n\n\nPractice in low-stakes situations. Do all your friends love that new TV show everyone\u2019s talking about? Don\u2019t be afraid to admit that you weren\u2019t all that impressed. Has someone misinterpreted what you said? Don\u2019t nod and play along; explain what you really meant, even if the miscommunication was harmless.\n\n, Identify what makes you happy and what your needs are. This will help you develop a set of expectations for other people to follow in how you would like to be treated. Think of situations where you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being treated with mutual respect or situations where you felt like your feelings were not being considered. Then consider what could happen to make you feel more respected., Acting confidently won\u2019t do you any good if you can never make up your mind or are trying too hard to \u201cgo with the flow.\u201d People will be accommodating to your needs if you can tell them clearly what those needs are.\n\n\nOff-loading decision-making onto everyone else is a passive-aggressive way of shirking your responsibility \u2013 and placing the consequences squarely on someone else\u2019s shoulders. The next time your friends ask you where you want to go to dinner, don\u2019t respond with, \u201cOh, wherever\u201d; give them a concrete answer.\n\n, A good approach is to adopt a \u201cwe\u201d mentality and come up with solutions that will make both parties happy, if the situation allows. This way, everyone\u2019s feelings are being considered and heard.For instance, if you drive your roommate to work every day, yet she doesn\u2019t pay for gas, approach her about this issue. You can say, \u201cI don\u2019t mind giving you rides every so often. Owning a car is really expensive, though, and I am saving you money and time if you were to take the bus to work every day. Would you mind chipping in for gas every week? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d In this way, you are acknowledging that she might not realize that you feel a certain way. Now she is aware of the problem without you using an accusing tone.\n\n, Self-confidence is reflected by your ability to understand how you see yourself. This includes your self-perception and where you believe you fit in the social hierarchy. If you see yourself in a negative light, you might experience great difficulty asserting your own thoughts, beliefs, needs, and feelings. Furthermore, you may feel intimidated or reluctant to ask questions when you need clarification, focus too heavily on your own negative traits, and lack trust in yourself. Self-doubt prevents assertive communication. Assess your self-confidence through self-evaluation by asking yourself these questions:Can you maintain eye contact when communicating with others?\nDo you project your voice properly?\nDo you speak confidently (without using the phrases \u201cuh\u201d or \u201cum\u201d frequently)?\nIs your physical posture or stance erect and open?\nDo you have the ability to ask questions when clarification is needed?\nAre you comfortable around other people?\nAre you able to say no when appropriate?\nAre you able to express anger and annoyance appropriately?\nDo you offer your opinion when in disagreement with others?\nDo you defend yourself against mistakes that are not your fault?\nIf you answered no to 3 or fewer of these questions, you are likely a self-assured individual. If you answered no to 4-6 of these questions, there is a significant chance that you see yourself negatively. If you answered no more to than 7 questions, you are likely to experience tremendous difficulty with self-confidence. You may often doubt your worthiness of respect or see yourself lower in the social hierarchy.\n\n, The way you hold yourself speaks volumes about you \u2013 long before you even get a chance to open your mouth. Keep your shoulders squared and your chin up. Avoid fidgeting (put your hands in your pockets if you must) or covering your mouth when you speak. Look people in the eye when you speak to indicate that you don't intend to be brushed off.\n\n\nTry not to be easy to read, especially if you are nervous or uncertain. Hide your \u201ctells\u201d by controlling your hands, feet, and facial expressions so that they don\u2019t betray your emotions.\nIf making eye contact is a problem, practice with sunglasses and then work up to doing it barefaced. If you must avert your gaze, look off into the distance as if in thought, not down.\nEven if you are nervous or confused, you can still act confident. There's no shame in asking questions.\n\n, Rushing when you talk is an admission that you don\u2019t expect people to take the time to listen. Speaking slowly, on the other hand, will indicate to people that you\u2019re worth the wait. Use a clear, calm voice. You don't need to be loud, but you do need to make yourself heard.\n\n\nIf people aren't noticing you, say \"Excuse me\" clearly and firmly. Don\u2019t be apologetic when you haven\u2019t done anything wrong, as this can communicate to people that you feel slightly embarrassed just for existing.\nTry to be concise when you speak. Even the most confident person in the world will lose their audience if they don\u2019t make their point soon enough.\nAvoid saying um or like as much as you can when you're trying to make a strong statement. Make a conscious effort to get these words out of your vocabulary.\n\n, Shallow though it may be, people make snap judgments based on your appearance. People who are naturally confident and charismatic can change others\u2019 minds, but the rest of us aren\u2019t so lucky. If you're wearing clothes that look like you've just got out of bed, or if you wear a pound of make-up with fluffy high-heels, the average person won't take you seriously. On the other hand, if you look like you're ready to get things done, people will tend to be more respectful.\n\n\nDressing well doesn\u2019t necessarily mean dressing up. If you\u2019re the naturally casual sort, focus on having clean, matching, unwrinkled clothes with no embarrassing slogans or inappropriate images.\nMaking an effort to be serious about your appearance will make it look like you're more serious about your demands.\n\n, This may sound silly, but if you want to project confidence, then you should sound firm and decisive when the moment comes. What better way to get there than to practice? You can practice in front of the mirror, into a recording, or even with a trusted friend, pretending he or she is your boss, significant other, or whomever you plan to speak with.\n\n\nWhen the moment comes, remember how confident you sounded when you were just rehearsing, and work to sound even more confident when it counts.\n\n, If you feel you still need help becoming assertive, it can help to see a professional. Counselors and psychologists have education and training specifically in helping people communicate in healthy and meaningful ways., Many universities offer assertiveness training to the students.This will help you practice assertiveness techniques while helping you discuss different situations where you feel you need help in being assertive, as well as help in controlling your stress as you navigate different situations.\n\n, Asserting yourself takes practice and time. Ask a friend to help you practice your communication skills in various scenarios. The more you face situations that demand assertiveness, even when they are mock situations, the more confident you will become.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":512}

{"text":" In this type of legal action, a large group of people (the plaintiffs) file a single lawsuit against a company or individual, (the defendant) for similar or identical grievances. All of the people who participate in a class action lawsuit share similar circumstances, injuries, and damages.Filing a class action lawsuit eliminates each person from having pay a lawyer to file a separate lawsuit.\nSpecific individuals are named as the lead plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit, who have claims that like those of the other plaintiffs involved in the suit.\nThe people who are plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit are collectively referred to as the class.\nTypically, there are at least 30 people involved in order to justify a class action lawsuit. However, there is no minimum number of plaintiffs required to file a class action lawsuit.\nCommon class action lawsuits may involve people who took a certain drug that has a bad side effect or people who bought a certain product that caused injuries.;\n, A plaintiff in a class action lawsuit must have had the same or similar experience with the defendant as other members of the class. The evidence against the defendant must be similar for everyone in the class. A class action is only appropriate when individual lawsuits, even by multiple people, against the defendant would not be efficient or cost-effective for the court system., While all class action lawsuits follow the same general rules and procedures, the subject of these lawsuits can differ widely. There are four basic types of class action lawsuits:\n\n\nSecurities class actions are brought on behalf of a group of investors or stockholders who have been injured as a result the improper conduct of a business. For example, the improper conduct at issue might include misstating the company\u2019s earnings, concealing or misrepresenting risks that the company is taking, or otherwise engaging in or hiding illegal activity.\nProducts liability or personal injury class actions generally are filed when a defective product, such as a drug with harmful side effects, or a mass accident, such as a toxic chemical spill, harms a large group of people.\nConsumer class actions may occur when many consumers are injured by a company\u2019s illegal business practices. Some common examples of this type of lawsuit involve illegal charges on bills, illegal penalties for late payments, and failure to comply with consumer protection laws, like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\nEmployment class actions typically are brought on behalf of employees of a company for violations of labor laws, such as wage laws, laws related to a safe working environment, and illegal employment discrimination.\n\n, This kind of suit does not technically become a class action lawsuit until the judge finds that it meets all the requirements of a class action lawsuit. The judge then must formally certify the suit as a class action lawsuit before any further action can take place., If there is already an existing class action lawsuit, you may be able to simply join the class. You often will receive a written notice by mail informing you that you have been named as part of a class in a class action lawsuit. If so, you can simply follow the instructions in the notice in order to participate.\n\n\nIn most cases, you do not have to do anything to participate in the case. This is the case, for instance, if you are part of a class who purchased a certain product that later was found to be defective.\nIf you are a class member who was seriously injured by a defective product, however, you may want to take a more active role in the class action lawsuit by attending settlement discussions with other class members and the attorneys for the class.\nIf you don\u2019t want to participate in the case, you have to take some action to opt out, which typically is to provide written notice that you want to opt out. You may choose to opt out if you would rather bring your own lawsuit rather than participate in the class action lawsuit. If you don\u2019t opt out, you cannot bring your own lawsuit against the defendant.\n\n, Sometimes, you might think that you should be included in a class, but you don\u2019t receive a written notice. If this is the case, you may be able to join it if you qualify. You can even search a database online for pending class actions by clicking here.If you have the same injuries that were caused by the same defendant as the other class members, you have the right to join the class.\nLook online for information on the class. In many cases, there will be a website that gives you information about the class action lawsuit, including how to join the class.\nResearch public records for pending law suits regarding similar complaints or grievances.\nIf you see an advertisement in a newspaper or magazine about a class action lawsuit, you can call the number in the advertisement to get more information on joining the class.\nYou typically will join the class by contacting the attorney for the class. The attorney will investigate your situation and determine whether your injury and situation are similar enough to the other class members.\n\n, A class action lawsuit is typically started by one or more people who feel that they have been treated wrongly by a defendant, which is usually a company or business. You will need a group of people together to approach an attorney about filing a class action lawsuit on your behalf.Take steps to identify other people who have the same complaint as you about the defendant. Although there is no certain number of people required to file a class action lawsuit, there are generally about 30 people who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way in order for a class action lawsuit to be practical and cost-effective.\nCheck with friends and others in your network to see if others share your desire to file a class action lawsuit.\nAdvertise in publications to find others who might have similar complaints or grievances and an interest in joining in the class action lawsuit.\n\n, The materials that might support a class action lawsuit include receipts, deeds, correspondence and other official papers of significance. Your attorney will want to have copies of any such evidence, and the attorney for the defendant may request it, as well., Since these suits are complex, he or she must have a significant amount of experience representing plaintiffs in class action lawsuits. These types of lawsuits are often the subject of newspaper articles, as they are big lawsuits that tend to be well-publicized.\n\n\nIf there is no class action lawsuit attorney in your area, contact those who are closest to your area and who seem to handle similar sorts of cases. A class action attorney may be willing to travel to you for a consultation, as class action lawsuits can be very lucrative for a lawyer, as well.\n\n, If the attorney has handled only securities class action lawsuits in the past, then you probably shouldn\u2019t hire him or her for a personal injury class action lawsuit. Choose an attorney who has specific experience handling class action lawsuits of this kind.\n\n, This means that the attorney will not charge you any attorney fees up front in order to file your suit. You won\u2019t have to pay the attorney any fees until you recover damages from the defendant. However, you will still be responsible for any costs that the attorney incurs in filing your suit, such as the court\u2019s filing fee.\n\n\nIn some cases, the attorney will advance the filing fee and other costs of the case if the plaintiffs cannot afford to pay the costs. The attorney will then seek reimbursement of these fees after the suit is finished.\nMany attorneys offer free consultations, which allows you to evaluate them and you find an attorney with whom you are comfortable.\n\n, Once the attorney has filed the lawsuit, the judge will determine if the suit qualifies as a class action lawsuit. If so, the judge will certify the class who has filed the lawsuit. This is the first step in a class action lawsuit. , Since class action lawsuits are almost always very costly and complicated, the vast majority of class action lawsuits end in a settlement. In very large cases involving thousands of plaintiffs, the settlement amount may be rather small for those who did not actually experience any serious injuries. For those who are injured, however, the settlement amount may be much greater.In many cases, the defendant may simply be unable to pay enough to compensate all of the plaintiffs fully. The defendant may have to come up with as much money as it can pay, and the class members will have to agree to split the money as fairly as possible.\nThe judge often will appoint a special master to help the parties reach a settlement. Usually, a special master is an experienced lawyer or mediator who will work with the class members, the attorneys, and the defendant to come up with a settlement agreement.\n\n, If your class action lawsuit settles, as most do, a judge will have to approve the settlement before the class will receive any money from the defendant. Even if the case does not settle, damages must be calculated prior to going to trial so that the attorney knows how much compensation to request from the defendant.Mass torts involving products liability or personal injuries.\nSecurities class action lawsuits.\nClass actions to stop discriminatory conduct.\nEstablishment of a damages fund for future victims\n\n, The judge presiding over the class action lawsuit may create a litigation plan for the case if it is particularly large or complex. The particulars of this plan will vary widely based on the suit and the judge who is creating it. For instance, a judge will sometimes bifurcate, or split, the issues into two or more separate trials, if it would be logical to do so.\n\n, Every type of lawsuit involves some time of exchange of information and evidence between the two sides to the dispute. A class action lawsuit, given its nature and magnitude, will necessarily involve extensive amounts of discovery. Discovery may include the following actions:\n\n\nTaking depositions, which allow attorneys to ask questions of the parties and other witnesses while under oath.\nAnswering interrogatories, which are written questions that the parties often must answer.\nReplying to requests for production of documents, which require a party to turn over copies of certain documents, such as medical records.\n\n, If the parties cannot reach a settlement, the case must proceed to a trial. The trial can be in front of the judge, or the defendant can request a jury trial., If the suit will involve a jury trial, the attorneys for both sides of the dispute will take turns picking jurors from a pool of available jurors who have been called for jury duty. Each attorney will have the chance to ask the court to excuse some jurors from the trial.\n\n\nThe process of choosing a jury is referred to as voir dire. The purpose of voir direct is to determine if any juror has a personal interest in the case or a prejudice that may wrongfully influence him or her during the trial.\nGive an opening statement. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney gets to go first and introduce the case to the jury. The defendant\u2019s attorney then has the same chance to do so. Each side will tell the jury what the case is about and what the evidence will prove.\n\n, First, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney will call different witnesses to the stand and question them about the dispute. This is referred to as direct examination. After the direct examination of each witness, the defendant\u2019s attorney will also question the witness, in a process referred to as cross-examination. Next, the defendant\u2019s attorney will call his or her witnesses, and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, likewise, will have the chance to cross-examine them.\n\n\nWitnesses may include parties to the case, such as the some of the named class members, or expert witnesses, such as doctors or accountant. The nature of any expert witnesses will depend on the type of class action lawsuit that is involved.\n\n, Each side\u2019s attorney will end the case by giving his or her closing argument, which summarizes the trial and the evidence. It is the last chance that an attorney will have to address the judge and jury.\n\n, After deliberating, or meeting to discuss the decision that it will make, the jury will announce its verdict. The jury decides if the defendant is financially responsible for the plaintiffs' injuries, and to what extent it is responsible.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":514}
{"text":" There are a number of medicines that are available to purchase over the counter that will help stomach aches. However it is important that you take the right medicine for the right symptoms. Before purchasing a medicine, consult a doctor or pharmacist and follow labels exactly. Child versions of medications are safest for teenagers as well.\n\n\nNote that if you experience daily stomach pain for several days in a row you should call your doctor and schedule an appointment to be seen. Prolonged stomach pain could be a sign of a serious health problem.;\n, Aspirin-based pain relievers can be harsh on the stomach and even cause bleeding, so avoid taking aspirin specifically. Ibuprofen and naproxen can be irritating as well. Instead of these options, take acetaminophen to relieve stomach aches.\n\n\nFor general stomach pain, call your doctor if it persists for several days or begins to worry you.\nAspirin should never be given to children or teenagers unless prescribed by your doctor due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, which can be dangerous.\n\n, Heartburn will feel like a painful burning sensation in the chest. It will usually occur after eating or while you are lying down. It is caused by acid build up in the stomach. An over the counter antacid or acid reducer will cure most cases of heartburn.If you continue to experience heartburn for more than two weeks while on over the counter medicine, or if your pain is severe, you have vomiting, or you are unable to eat due to pain, call your doctor to schedule an appointment.\nNote that antacids containing aluminum can cause constipation. Also, antacids containing magnesium can cause diarrhea.\nRead labels carefully. Adult Pepto Bismol, Kaopectate, bismatrol, and and some other drugs marketed for heartburn contain bismuth subsalicylate. Like aspirin, this drug can cause a dangerous condition called Reye's syndrome in children and teens. Do not take it without a prescription, especially if you might have the flu or another virus., Generally this means less than three bowel movements per week. Constipation is relatively common, but for some it can cause stomach pain and discomfort. A laxative or stool softener can help relieve discomfort.Check with your doctor or pharmacist on which medication to try.\n\n\nIf your constipation continues for three weeks or longer call your doctor to schedule an appointment. You should also call your doctor if you begin to lose weight or see blood in your stool., Chose one of these medicines and begin taking it, as instructed on the bottle, as soon as bleeding or cramping starts.If these medicines do not work, your doctor will be able to prescribe a stronger medicine for you.\n\n, There are several options to chose from. You can drink a cup of herbal tea after each meal to help settle an upset stomach. The following three types are worth trying:\n\n\nChamomile tea contains an anti-inflammatory agent that can help settle an upset stomach. You can pick up chamomile tea at almost any supermarket. Try having a cup of tea after meals to settle your stomach. You should drop the tea bag in hot, but not boiling, water, so as not to destroy chamomile's active ingredient.\nMint tea is a useful remedy for gas, bloating, and indigestion because it works to relax stomach muscles. Peppermint tea is available at most supermarkets, but you can also use fresh mint leaves. Simply drop the leaves in hot water and let them sit for five to 10 minutes. Enjoy this drink after meals for best effect.\nMake yourself a rice tea. Rice tea is simply rice, water and honey. Boil half a cup of rice in six cups of water for 15 minutes. Next strain the rice out of the water, saving the water in a bottle. Add a small amount of sugar or honey to the water and drink warm. Rice tea has been shown to help settle upset stomachs., Yogurt can help speed up digestion because it contains active cultures. Mix yogurt with fruit juice for a healthy snack that will aid digestion. Try one part yogurt, one part juice.\n\n\nCarrot, apple, and peach drinks work well for indigestion. Avoid acidic fruits such as orange juice, as they can be harsh on an upset stomach.\nYogurt labels will note if they contain active cultures. Be sure to only buy those with active cultures if you are using it to help with a stomach ache.\n\n, Try mixing a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm water and a tablespoon of honey. This will help to reduce cramping, gas, and even heartburn., Ginger has been used for thousands of years to settle stomachs. Studies have shown that it is the anti-inflammatory properties in ginger that are so effective. Ginger can be taken fresh, in ginger capsules, ginger chews, or as ginger ale., For maximum effectiveness the pad or bottle should be around 104 \u00b0F or 40 \u00b0C. The heating pad or hot water bottle works by activating heat receptors deep in the body which, in turn, cause your body to not feel as much pain.This treatment is particularly recommended for menstrual pain.\n\n, Each body is different, so it can be difficult to give general advice about what foods should be avoided. When you eat a certain food, pay attention to how you feel afterwards. By doing this you will soon be able to pinpoint what food or foods are causing problems. Talk to your doctor to see if you may have an allergy to a certain food, gluten sensitivity, or celiac disease. Be particularly mindful about the following foods:\n\n\nProcessed foods, including fast food, white bread, sausage, donuts, hamburgers, and potato chips.\nDairy products can cause stomach aches in some people, especially if they are unknowingly lactose intolerant. Try staying off dairy products for a week to see if there is improvement, or try a soy based milk.Spicy and greasy food can irritate the stomach and should be avoided if you are experiencing stomach pains.\n\n, The best foods to help with a stomach ache are high in fiber. Your stomach aches may actually be caused by a lack of fiber in your diet. It is also important that you drink water, approximately two to three liters per day (nine to 13 cups) is the recommended amount.Foods high in fiber include fruits like bananas, vegetables like broccoli, and many whole grains. Prunes, cherries, raisins, and apricots are particularly effective. These foods will help with regular bowel movements and prevent constipation.\n\n, Healthy foods like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and yogurt make gas in your stomach and can cause stomach pain. Eat these foods in moderation. To help prevent gas chew these foods (and others) thoroughly, and do not swallow too quickly.\n\n\nDrinking ginger ale can relieve stomach aches caused by gas. After you drink, you can try to burp or pass gas to relieve pressure. Over the counter Gas-X may also help.\n\n, Overeating can cause discomfort and stomach pain, even if you eat too much of a healthy food. Try not to get all of your calories in one or two big meals; instead, spread out your calories in three meals and one to two healthy snacks. To ease the load on your stomach, here is a detailed breakdown of how many calories should be consumed by teenagers daily.14\u201316 year old male should have 3,100 when active or 2,300 when not active. Females should have 2,350 and 1,750, respectively.\n17\u201318 year old male should have 3,300 when active or 2,450 when not active. Females should have 2,400 and 1,750, respectively.\n\n, Teenagers should not be drinking alcohol, but if you are it could be a cause of stomach aches. Alcohol increases the amount of acid your stomach produces, and can lead to ulcers, acid reflux and other issues. Alcohol can also cause vomiting and diarrhea., Stomach aches can be caused by stress, anxiety, or depression. Try to reduce your stress level. Try exercising for 30 minutes each day with a long walk or jog.

{"text":" You can find it at your local home improvement store or online. How much you buy will depend on which appliances you plan on covering.\n\n\nStainless steel contact paper is plastic-based, so it cannot withstand heat. It is not suitable for surfaces that get hot, such as stovetops.;\n, Having someone help you will not only make your work go by quicker, but also make it easier. You will also get a nicer finish with fewer wrinkles and air bubbles.\n\n, This is very important. If there is any dirt or grease on your appliance, the contact paper may not stick. Use a high-quality appliance cleaner that can cut through grease, and scrub your appliance clean. Be sure to wipe it dry with a clean cloth afterwards.\n\n, This will ensure that your lines are straight and even. If you are covering a very wide appliance, you may need to cut two strips of contact paper.\n\n\nThe grain on the finished piece will be running vertically. If you want the grain to be running horizontally, cut your contact paper accordingly.\n\n, It will take a while, but this will lessen the chances of wrinkles or bubbles forming.\n\n, If you are covering an appliance door, make sure that there is enough contact paper hanging over the edge to cover the side. This will typically be around 2 inches (5.08 centimeters).Have a friend or family member hold the rest of the contact paper away from the appliance's surface; this will prevent wrinkles and air bubbles.\n\n, If you don't have a credit card, you can use any other thin, plastic tool, such as a scrapper or spatula. Avoid anything made out of metal, as this can tear the contact paper.\n\n\nFor added security, consider wrapping the credit card in a thin cloth to further prevent any rips or tears., Keep doing this until you reach the bottom of your appliance. If you get any air bubbles, push them to the side of the appliance, or carefully lift the contact paper away and smooth it down again.If you need to use a second sheet of contact paper, overlap the two edges slightly., If you are covering an appliance door, you will have some excess contact paper hanging over the edges. Carefully flatten these flaps down onto the sides of your appliance's door. Run the credit card from front to back in short rows. Start from the top of the door, and work your way towards the bottom.\n\n, Simply trim the excess away using a sharp craft blade.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":517}
{"text":" Depending on how long you will be traveling or what types of items you are packing, figure out what types of luggage you need to use.\n\n\nThe permitted size of carry-on bags varies from airline to airline. Check the requirements for the airline with which you will travel to learn how big your carry-on bag can be.Remember that certain items are only permissible when packed in a checked bag.;\n, TSA, or Transportation Security Administration and other national bodies have guidelines for a variety of items, ranging from foods and liquids to weapons. Consider what items you need to pack that might be prohibited or restricted:Food items\nLiquids, such as bath products\nSporting goods\nTools\nSelf defense items\nSharp objects.\n\n, There are not many things that TSA and other relevant organizations completely prohibits, compared to the number of things that are allowed. However, many items are only permitted when they are packed in your checked bag. Research your questionable items and learn if they are only permissible when checked.\n\n\nMost liquids and some food items, like gravies and sauces or sometimes even ketchup, must be 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6\u00a0ml) or less in order to be allowed in a carry-on bag. The rules may be different for necessities such as medicine, but there still are restraints for that., While you may be inclined to pack several different outfits and pairs of shoes, consider packing only a few basic essentials and pack tighter by pairing them different ways.If you want to limit your packing to a carry-on only, then you have a limited amount of space. On the other hand, while you have more space in a checked bag, you will be charged more if it is overweight.\n\n\nAdditionally, overpacking your carry-on or checked bag might result in it not fitting into the airline-approved measurements, in which case you might have to remove items from your bag to put into another bag or leave it at the airport.Checked bag fees start at $25 for one checked bag at most US airlines and go up from there, with increases for multiple checked bags and bags that are overweight., Because liquids and aerosols have the potential to explode due to the changing air pressure of air travel, TSA and other relevant organizations have special regulations about them.\n\n\nAll liquid items that are 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6\u00a0ml) or smaller can go in your carry-on, and they must be packed in one 1-quart bag. Each traveler is only permitted to have one of these bags.Items that are larger that 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6\u00a0ml) can be packed in a checked bag. They do not have to be enclosed in a zip-top bag, but it is recommended in order to protect your other packed belongings.\nMedications and nourishment items for infants and children are exempt from these rules., One of the easiest ways to save space in your luggage is to change how you pack your clothing. Instead of folding your clothing and stacking it, roll it up so that it takes up less space.Rolling your clothing not only saves space but also reduces wrinkles in clothes.\n\n, Start packing your bag by putting all of the heaviest items on the bottom, such as shoes. Then, start layering your rolled clothes on top, starting with the heaviest or largest rolled items, like sweaters or jeans, and moving to the lightest items.Packing your items in this way prevents your clothes from being further compressed and wrinkled by being buried under heavier items.\nPut toiletries and other light items on top so that they are easily accessible for removing at the security checkpoint.\n\n, If you are packing boots or shoes, you can pack small clothing items, like undergarments, inside them. This saves packing space for other items, but only do this with items that you do not mind getting wrinkled.\n\n, When taking both a carry-on item and a checked bag, consider putting a change of clothes in your carry-on, just in case your checked bag does not make it to your destination.This way, you have at least one additional set of clothing to wear until you receive your checked bag.\nIt would also be helpful to include some key toiletry items, like a toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant, as long as they meet the 3.4 fluid-ounce (100.6\u00a0ml) requirement.\n\n, If you are using a suitcase, either a small one for a carry-on or a large one for a checked bag, avoid putting bulky items in the outer zipper pockets. Doing so causes the bag to become overstuffed, causing it to no longer fit airline size requirements.Put magazines, thin books, or other slim items in these pockets.\n\n, TSA checks all luggage, and they ask that it not be locked so that they can easily access it. If you lock it, they may damage your luggage trying to get it open. TSA is not liable when this happens.TSA does have approved locks that they can open with their own tools, including Safe Skies and Travel Sentry.\n\n, Airlines now allow travelers to check in for their flights and secure their seats online up to 24 hours in advance. You can do this via airline apps on smartphones or on their websites.\n\n\nChecking in online ahead of time also saves you time in getting to the airport, because you can head straight to security and skip the check-in lines upon arrival.\n\n, If you check in early, you can print or access your boarding pass through your airline's mobile app. Be sure to print it out or take a screenshot of it on your smartphone, in case you have no service in the airport to access the mobile app.\n\n\nIf you check in at the airport, then airline agents will provide you with your boarding pass at that time.\n\n, Identification is required for adult travelers who are 18 and older. Children under the age of 18 are not required to have identification when they are traveling with an adult companion. You must have a valid form of identification, including but not limited to:U.S. driver's license\nU.S. passport\nU.S. passport card\nU.S. military ID\nPermanent resident card\nGovernment-issued passport\nBorder crossing card.\n\n, Be aware of what time your flight is supposed to depart and what time boarding is supposed to begin. Plan to be at the airport with enough time to get through security and make it to your gate on time.\n\n\nAirlines recommend that you arrive 30-45 minutes prior to departure for domestic flights, depending on whether you have to check any baggage. For international flights, it is recommended that you arrive at least two hours prior to departure to allow time for completing international requirements.Accommodate for extra time if you have to drive yourself and park in long-term parking. You will have extra time for traveling from the parking lot to the terminal via the airport shuttle.\nIf your airport is large and extremely busy, take that into consideration and arrive early, just to be sure. Also think about what day of the week you are traveling. Weekends are usually busy travel times, which means the airport and security checkpoint might be busier.\n\n, You will need your boarding pass and a form of identification, and when you reach the screening checkpoint, you will need to have certain items easily accessible to put through screening. Keep them at the top of your carry-on so that you do not have to dig through it to find them.\n\n\nLiquids and aerosols in the quart-sized bag\nTechnology devices\nMedically necessary medications and liquids\nNourishment items for infants and children.\n\n, When going through security, you have to remove a variety of items\u2014or not wear them at all\u2014in order to pass the screening.You will put these in their own containers to pass through the X-ray machine, and then you can proceed through the metal detector.\n\n\nShoes\nCoats, jackets, and sweaters\nBelts\nCoins\nCell phones\nJewelry.\n\n, If you do have liquid medications or breast milk, formula, or juice for an infant or child, you need to alert the TSA or other officers so that it can be screened properly.\n\n\nLet the TSA officer or other representative know that you have medically necessary liquids or medications when you are going through the screening. If you also need items such as ice packs, syringes, pumps, and IV bags, notify the officer about those, as well. It is helpful to have them labeled for easy screening. Keep all of these items separate from other liquids, like bath and hygiene products. Any ice packs or frozen gel packs that are necessary for your medication must be frozen solid at the security checkpoint. You do have the option to not have your medication screened by X-ray or to not have it opened, but in that case, other screening measures will have to be taken.If you have nourishment items for an infant or child, you are also allowed to bring them in excess of 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6\u00a0ml) in a carry-on item, and they can be in a zip-top bag larger than one quart. However, they must be separate from other liquids that you are checking through security. Alert the officer that you have these items so that they can be screened correctly. The officer may want to X-ray or open your breast milk, formula, or juice, but you can deny that if you would like to. In that case, other screening measures will have to be taken. Ice packs and frozen gel packs will need to be frozen solid at the time you go through security. Other items such as canned, jarred, and processed baby food are permitted, as well as liquid-filled teethers, but they will also have to be screened., Once you are through security, use the signs in the airport to help you find your gate. It is best to go straight there in order to avoid missing your flight and to make sure that you know where it is.\n\n\nAfter you have found your gate, you can go to the restroom, get something to eat, or shop, if you have time.\n\n, Make the boarding process faster for yourself and everyone else by keeping any items that you anticipate you will want during the flight in the carry-on item that you will put under the seat in front of you. This will save you from digging through your carry-on item before sitting down and holding up the boarding process., After getting through security, you can go to the restaurants and shops in your terminal to buy drinks. You can also pack TSA-approved snacks in your carry-on to avoid buying them from vendors in the terminal.\n\n\nBeing prepared with snacks and drinks will help tide you over until you get to your destination, because although flights still do beverage service, many short haul flights no longer offer food or snacks. When they do offer meals, you normally have to pay for them.\nAn alternative is to eat at one of the airport restaurants. These are usually overpriced, but if you have a long time to wait or will have a long time before you can get your next meal, it is a good idea to eat at a restaurant.\n\n, It can be hard to find places to charge your technology in airports. Many other people are trying to do the same thing, so finding power outlets is tricky.\n\n\nOnce you are on your plane, you will be asked to power off your electronic devices or put them in Airplane Mode. Be sure to do this to avoid interference with airline signals. Remember that you cannot access any apps that require cellular data or Wi-Fi when your smartphone or other device is in Airplane Mode.\nMany airlines now offer Wi-Fi on flights, but it is almost always for a fee. Determine whether it is worth the money to access Wi-Fi on the flight. For example, if you are taking a business trip and have work to do while you travel, it will likely be worthwhile. If your trip is for pleasure, though, and you have no real need for using Wi-Fi other than entertainment, it might not be worth the price.\n\n, To pass time on layovers and during travel, bring books, crossword puzzles, word searches, or other types of entertainment. You can read by yourself, read to one of your travel companions, or work on the puzzles with travel companions.\n\n, Either while you are traveling or while you wait in the airport for your flight, you can take a nap. Airports and airplanes are not the most comfortable places to sleep, but if you have an extremely early flight, overnight flight, or long travel day, it is a great time to get some rest., Once your plane has reached a certain altitude, your flight attendants will announce that approved electronic devices can be used. If you would like to use your technology, you can watch a movie or a TV show to pass the time.\n\n\nSome airplanes have small TV screens in the backs of the headrests, so you can watch what is on those TVs. Keep in mind that you usually have to pay extra to access more desirable channels, instead of watching their infomercial channels or a map of your travel.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":518}

{"text":" This is so you can tell apart the white from the blue thread which makes up denim. If you skip this step then your whole shorts could get ruined because all the threads will be white and impossible to tell apart.;\n, If you look closely at the denim you can see white and blue threads running horizontal against each other. Cut two horizontal lines across the shorts using scissors, leaving a strip of fabric in between the slits. Cut them the length you want your distressed\/worn patch to be. Using a tool you want to remove the blue threads from the fabric you just cut. You could use a needle, safety pin, or food\/salad clamps to remove the blue threads, you need to do this constantly until all the blue thread has gone and you only have white strings showing, it takes quite a while so do this when you have a bit of time, don't rush otherwise you could be left with just a frayed hole.\n\n, You may want to leave some white and just cut it short to leave threads hanging to give an even better look!\n\n, All you need to do is put the shorts in the wash and that will separate the threads even more to have more exaggerated holes and to remove all the excess thread that's not needed.\n\n, Don't use a tumble dryer as the threads can get caught and break from the shorts, once they're done you're ready to start bleaching! Always wear protective gloves as bleach does burn straight through skin! Now, I wouldn't personally recommend any brand of bleach because you're not looking for the hygiene job, just how thick the bleach is. Of course you can't test the bleach in-store so you're going to have to find the best brand for you out of trial and error. Buy the thickest bleach you can afford and water it down when its in the bowl\/container.\n\n, If you only want a half an half effect there's no need for bands. Don't use red rubber bands otherwise the red dye used in the bands will leak onto the shorts leaving red stains and patches. Here are the methods to get the look you want-\n\n\nAll of the shorts in- All shorts will turn a whitey-blue colour.\nHalf of the shorts in- A two tone white and blue effect.\nTie rubber bands around shorts in a ball- Random spotty tie dye effect.\nTie rubber band knots randomly- Small clouds of white.\n\n, Don't use any other methods to dry the shorts otherwise the effect and colour could change. Leave the shorts for 3 days to make sure they are definitely dry otherwise you could burn yourself testing if the shorts are still wet.\n\n, But you can add more items to your shorts! Lots of DIY and accessory stores sell chains, studs and gems which you can sew or glue onto your shorts. Even though studding may take a lot of time it make shorts look even better and shop bought. You can write or design anything using the gems\/studs! For example your initial, just covering a pocket or making designs like a cross or a skull. Id recommend HobbyCraft for their choice in clothes decorations.\n\n, Blue isn't enough this summer and colour range all over the rainbow! Fabric dye can be very easy to get hold of and its not expensive either, you can buy fabric dye at all hobby stores or general DIY stores. Fabric dye doesn't contain anymore bleach so your shorts won't get ruined.\n\n, Lay shorts in liquid for 30 minutes then take out and lye on newspaper to prevent staining. Leave shorts to dry naturally without any heat and there you have it! Your own pair of bleached, distressed jeans! Enjoy!\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":521}

If you cannot control your urine (i.e. are leaking urine involuntarily), this is another potential sign of CES. Similarly, a sudden inability to control your bowels (such as inadvertently passing stool or leaking stool from your rectum) is a possible sign of CES. All of these warrant prompt medical attention and evaluation.\n\n, Seek medical help immediately.\n\n,\"If you notice numbness in the \"saddle area\" (picture the area of your pelvis that would be in contact with a saddle if you were to sit on one), this area it is a \"red flag\" (worrisome) symptom and you need to see a doctor immediately. Numbness in the genital (\"saddle\") area is not normal, and may be a sign of impending (or already present) CES.\n\n, You may feel an aching and severe pain in your lower back, which can be debilitating. This is another red flag symptom and it may vary in intensity or grow slowly over time., You may find that your ankle and knee reflexes are diminished. You may also experience deteriorating reflexes in the anus and bulbospongiosus muscle, located between the anus and the genitals.,\"Oftentimes, CES follows an incident that causes trauma or another problem in the spinal cord. Things to be aware of that greatly increase your risk of CES include:\n\n\nA recent infection (it is possible that this may have spread to the spinal cord)\nRecent back surgery\nRecent back trauma, such as an accident or other injury\nA history of cancer (sometimes cancer metastases can spread to the spine leading to compression of the nerve roots)\n\n, Time spent waiting or hesitating is precious time lost that could cost you your long-term function and health.\n\n, If any of these are abnormal, it may be an indication of potential Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES).\n\n\nYour doctor may test your mobility and coordination by asking you to walk on your heels and toes.\nHe or she will examine for pain when you bend forward, backward, and to each side.\nYour doctor will check your anal sensation and reflexes, as abnormalities here are key aspects of the diagnosis of CES.\n\n, The imaging test will allow the doctor to see your spinal cord, including the nerve roots, and to evaluate what, if anything, may be causing them to be compressed. Possible sources of spinal cord compression that may be detected on CT or MRI include:A primary spine tumor or cancer metastases\nA herniated disc in your spine\nBone spurs\nAn infection that has gotten into your spinal cord\nA fracture of the spinal cord\nNarrowing of the spinal canal for any reason\nInflammatory spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis (inflammatory arthritis)\nSpinal hemorrhages\n\n, This is when contrast material is inserted into the cerebrospinal fluid in your spinal cord, and then an x-ray type image is taken.\n\n\nThe contrast allows clear visualization as to whether there are any abnormalities or displacements in your spinal column.\nThe myelogram may show herniated discs, bone spurs, or tumors, all of which may be responsible for causing CES.\n\n, Your doctor may perform the following tests:\n\n\nNerve conduction velocity (NCV) \u2014 This test will measure the speed of electrical impulse as it moves through the nerve. This test can determine if there is nerve damage and can how much.The nerve will be stimulated by an electrode patch attached at one end and the electric impulse is recorded by another patch.Electromyography (EMG) \u2014 This test is often done at the same time as an NCV and it measures the electrical activity in your muscles., The surgery needs to be performed within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, if possible, and the sooner it is done the better.\n\n\nThe surgery will consist of removing whatever material (such as a tumor, or an infection) that is compressing your spinal cord.\nThe goal is that, by treating the underlying cause (the cause of the spinal cord compression), the tension will be removed from your nerve roots, and you should hopefully be able to regain function.\n\n, These may include:\n\n\nChronic pain \u2014 some people require long-term pain medications to ease ongoing nerve-related pain following CES.\nBladder or bowel dysfunction \u2014 some people continue to struggle with bladder and\/or bowel control, even after surgical resolution of their CES. (However, the good news here is that bladder and bowel function often improve in the years following surgery; it just may take longer to regain function than other affected areas.)\nSexual problems \u2014 patients are often advised to see a sex therapist for help if they are struggling to regain sexual function.\nMotor problems \u2014 problems walking or performing other movement tasks, particularly with your lower limbs.\n\n, Needless to say, these are things you want to avoid! Therefore, if in doubt, go to your local Emergency Room for evaluation of your signs and symptoms to ensure that, if you are developing CES, it is treated and resolved as quickly as possible.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":522}

Start with your palms and work to the back of your hands. Make sure that you also clean the areas between your fingers. The next step is to focus on washing from your fingers to your wrists. Finally, rinse thoroughly and pat your hands dry.\n\n\nIf there is no water source, rub your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer., It is always important to check the doctor\u2019s orders again before you begin. Giving a patient the wrong IV bag could lead to a life-threatening situation, such as an allergic reaction.\n\n\nYou should double check that you are giving the medication to the right patient, that you are doing it at the right date and time, that you are giving the correct medication in the correct order, and that the bag is the right volume.\nIf you have any questions at all, it is important that you ask the doctor before continuing so that you are 100% sure you understand what you are supposed to do.\n\n, A set is the tube and connector that regulate how much fluid the patient will get. A macroset is used when you are supposed to give the patient 20 drops per minute, or about 100 mL per hour. Adults generally receive a macroset.A microset is used when you want to give the patient 60 drops of IV fluid per minute. Infants, toddlers, and younger children generally need a microset.\nThe size of the tubing (and the size of needle) that you use will also depend on the purpose for the IV. If it is an emergency situation where the patient needs fluids as quickly as possible, you will more likely choose a larger needle and tube in order to deliver the fluids and\/or blood products or other medications as quickly as possible.\nIn less urgent situations, you may choose a smaller needle and tubing.\n\n, The trick here is that the higher the needle gauge, the smaller the size of the needle. 14 is the largest and it is usually used to correct symptoms of shock and trauma. 18-20 is the usual kind of needle used by adult patients. 22 is usually used on pediatric patients (such as infants, toddlers, and young children) or geriatric patients with ., Always wear gloves for standard protection against blood and body fluid exposure.\n\n, When the time comes to give the patient the IV, you will want to have all of your supplies right there. This will ensure that the procedure as quick and easy as possible.\n\n, Look at the bag and locate the port of entry (this is located at the top of the IV bottle and is similar to a bottle cap). The port of entry is also where the macroset or microset line will be inserted. Unwrap an alcohol swab to sanitize the port of entry and the surrounding area of the bag.If you ever get confused while assembling the IV bag, there should be instructions written on the bag that you can follow. However, if you have any questions, stop what you're doing and find someone who knows what to do.\n\n, Ensure that the drip chamber is in place (this is the part of the IV line that collects the fluid going through the patient\u2019s vein). This is also the part where medical personnel are able to regulate the IV to make sure the patient gets the right medication.\n\n\nIV pumps, or infusion pumps, are often used to help deliver a precise dose for the proper amount of time.\n\n, Make sure that the drip chamber is half filled. Once it is half filled, let the fluid in the IV flow until it reaches the end of the line (this is to remove any air bubbles are are trapped in the line). Close it when it reaches the end by clamping the tube.\n\n\nThis is also termed as priming the tubing. This is an essential step, as inserting an air bubble into the patient could be fatal.\n\n, The IV is sterile (as in it does not have any bad microorganisms on it). If the line touches the floor, the fluid in the IV could be compromised (meaning bad microorganisms could get into it and infect the patient).If the IV line does touch the floor, you will have to prepare a new IV, as the contaminated IV could potentially harm your patient. Keep the IV line close so that it does not touch the floor again.\n\n, Be courteous, introduce yourself and tell him that you will be the one administering his IV fluids. It's best to lay all of the facts out for your patient \u2014 the needle puncturing his skin will hurt. Try to describe it so that he knows what he is getting into., Wash your hands again to ensure extra cleanliness before putting on your gloves \u2014 this can also help reassure the patient that you care about her health and protecting her against unnecessary exposure to bacteria.\n\n\nLying or sitting calms the patient down and actually reduces the amount of pain she will feel. It also ensures that she is in a stable position where she won't pass out if she has a psychological fear of needles.\n\n, The cannula is the tube-like structure that you will insert at the same time as the needle, but it will stay in place after you take the needle out. You should look for a vein on the non-dominant arm (the one the person doesn't write with). You should look for a long, dark vein that you will easily be able to see when you are inserting the needle.Start by looking for veins lower down on the arm, or even on the back of the hand. Starting lower down will give you more \"chances\" if you are not successful at inserting the IV on your first try. If you need to try a second time, you will need to move higher up the arm, so there are benefits to trying lower down first if you can find a reasonably visible vein.\nYou can also look for veins that are located in the crease where the forearm meets the upper arm. These are often the easiest to insert an IV into; however, if the patient bends his arm, this can block the IV.\n\n, When you tie the tourniquet, it will cause the vein to bulge, which will make it easier to see, and easier to insert the needle into.\n\n, Use an alcohol swab to clean the insertion site (the spot that you will be putting the needle into). Use a circular motion when you clean the spot so that you get rid of as many microorganisms as possible. Let the area dry.Do not wave your hand over the area as if to dry it, as this can causes bacteria to be waved over the \"cleaned area\". Instead, allow the alcohol to air dry.\n\n, Position the cannula so that you are holding it at a 30\u201345 degree angle to the patient\u2019s arm and vein. Hold the cannula like you would hold a syringe so that you do not accidentally pass it through the vein. When you feel a \u201cpop\u201d and dark blood appears inside the cannula, decrease the angle of insertion so it is parallel to the patient\u2019s skin.If this is your first time you are attempting this procedure, make sure you are doing so under supervision.\n\n\nPush the cannula forward another 2mm. Then fix the needle and push the rest of the cannula in a little bit further.Remove the needle fully. Apply pressure above insertion site while maintaining site and connect tubing, otherwise the patient may bleed.\nDispose of the needle in a designated sharps container.\nFinally, untie the tourniquet and clean the insertion site where the cannula is sticking out of the skin with a hypoallergenic dressing or alcohol swab.\n\n, You should do this by slowly feeding the tubing into the cannula until you can connect it. Make sure that it is secure once it is connected. Slowly open the line so that the IV fluid goes into the tube and into the patient. You should also put tape on the tubing so that it stays in place on the patient\u2019s arm.\n\n\nStart by administering normal saline in order to ensure the IV is open and unobstructed.If you notice swelling in the surrounding tissue, or other problems with fluid administration, stop the saline flush and immediately remove the cannula. You will need to start the process over again.\nAssuming that the saline flows normally through the IV access you have set up, you can proceed to administering what the doctor has specifically ordered through the IV.\n\n, Regulate the IV drip rate according to the physician\u2019s order. Usually in a clinic or hospital, the physician will order a specific rate, like milliliters per hour.\n\nIn a field setting, you will need to do this manually. The IV may have roller clamps and you need to count the drops per minute. Other IV sets already have a roller knob that you can turn and set the drops per minute so that you don\u2019t have to count.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Check your patient\u2019s heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and temperature. Report any untoward signs and symptoms. These symptoms could include an elevated heart rate, respiratory rate, difficulty breathing, hives, anaphylactic shock, or an increase in temperature and high blood pressure.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":523}
{"text":" Common majors for successful strength and conditioning coaches include Strength and Conditioning, obviously, but also Kinesiology and Exercise Science, among others. By taking classes in these subjects, you will gain the knowledge you'll need to help your athletes improve.\n\n\nYour chances of being hired and paid well in this position will be higher if you hold an associate's or bachelor's degree in one of these or in a related field.\nResearch your local colleges and universities to determine which program is the best fit for you.\nIf attending college full-time is not an option for you, take continuing education classes in those fields. Even if you don't earn a degree, you will still learn the type of information you will need to perform the job.;\n, If you want to work at a high level and make a larger salary, your employer might require certification as a strength and conditioning coach. However, if the position you are trying to attain does not specifically request certification, you may be able to skip it.\n\n, Although there are many agencies for certifying strength and conditioning coaches, the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) is the most widely respected of these., The National Strength and Conditioning Association's exam costs $260 for NSCA members, and $445 for non-members. Make room for the exam in your budget.\n\n, Look up what information will be cover in your agency of choice's test. Study the format of the exam as well \u2014\u00a0will it be entirely multiple choice, or do you need to brush up your essay-writing skills?\n\n\nIf you took classes in college relevant to the exam, look at your old class notes to refresh the information in your mind.\nMost reputable certification agencies will provide study materials for people studying to take the exam. Avail yourself of those resources.\n\n, An elementary-aged athlete\u2019s body is very different from a high school-aged athlete\u2019s body, and you cannot treat every age group with the same blanket approach to exercise.With young children (6-11 years old), be aware that girls will develop motor skills at an earlier age than boys.\nWith children, plan activities that will help young athletes develop basic motor skills like jumping, throwing, catching, skipping, climbing, etc., rather than focusing on the specialized motions of the specific sport you\u2019re preparing them for. Older athletes should be encouraged to develop more complex skills like speed, agility, and flexibility.\n\n, Remember to address all the major muscle groups, including calf muscles, hamstrings, quadriceps, shoulders, etc., You cannot use a generic, blanket approach to all athletes. Each sport \u2014 and sometimes, each position within a sport \u2014 will require athletes to develop specialized skill sets. Make sure you understand the needs of your particular athletes before beginning a training program with them. For example, goalies in ice hockey and catchers in baseball spend much of their time squatting. Their strength and conditioning needs will be very different from a marathon runner, whose needs will be very different from a football running back whose position calls for quick bursts of speed and the agility to make sharp cuts.\n\n, Yoga is a terrific way to strengthen core muscles, as are sit-ups and crunches, low back extensions, Supermans, and exercises with kettle bells. You should also consider activities that will benefit players of specific sports; for example, basketball players will benefit from passing a medicine ball back and forth, while taking golf swings while balanced on one leg will help golfers., Though athletes in all sports should work on their upper bodies, some sports \u2014\u00a0gymnastics, for example \u2014 specifically require a great deal of upper body strength. Bicep curls, push-ups, tricep push-ups, pull-ups, and rope climbing are all good exercises for arm strength.\n\n, If their legs can't support them, athletes will be hard-pressed to win in a competitive setting. Running, either on a track or on a treadmill, not only develops long muscle in athletes' legs, but it also improves their cardiovascular health and endurance, allowing them to perform at a high level without tiring for longer amounts of time. To add power for athletes whose sports require it specifically, leg exercise routines should include squats, leg presses, lunges, and vertical jumps.\n\n, These exercises are meant to maintain, rather than increase, muscle mass.\n\n\nHave your athletes hold each position for a set amount of time; consider their injury and physical ability, and use your discretion in determining the duration of the hold. Add at least 10 seconds onto their best time every two weeks to improve form.\n\n, As a strength and conditioning coach, you will serve in many capacities: teacher, leader, motivator, and support system for the athletes under your guidance. Because you will see your athletes through a wide variety of experiences, you need to be able to adjust your approach from context to context, from day to day.\n\n, Although your athletes will likely be socialized to accept orders from coaches unquestioningly, there may be situations in which you have to alter the manner in which you deliver your message, depending on the emotional state of your audience in that context. Your goal as a coach is not to domineer, but to get the best possible results out of your athletes. This may mean that you have to change the delivery of your message from \u201can order\u201d to \u201cadvice.\u201d\n\n, Ethos is credibility: speak from a place of authority. Most of your communication will be ethically charged orders and commands. Logos is a logical approach: perhaps an athlete feels like giving up because he or she is having a bad day. Reason with them. Instead of speaking from authority, help them understand how logical it is to work through their bad days to reach their goals. Pathos is an emotional approach: on your athletes' worst days, you\u2019ll have to work hard to understand how they\u2019re feeling and help them change negative emotions into positive mindsets.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":524}
{"text":" Medieval can be anything from 900 (kilts and loose gowns) to 1600 (neck high corsets and hoop skirts). If you show up in an Elizabethan gown and everyone else is sporting basic tunics and pants, it will look silly.;\n, Find out if it will be cheaper to make it (if you have the skills for that) or cheaper to buy it online.\n\n, Then you can buy in bulk, cheaper. Also, you'll be able to spot your family easily in the crowd despite strange clothing you're not used to.\n\n, A man who hates the notion of wearing tights will be embarrassed and uncomfortable for the whole wedding. A woman who would never display her cleavage shouldn't wear a corset.\n\n, Offer to put them in touch with anyone else going to the wedding - often for a large order, they'll let you get things at a lower rate.\n\n, If you mention to a vendor that another place is willing to make a bulk deal, you could get better rates - but do *not* lie to them. A lot of those people work together at the same fairs, and have good friendly relationships.\n\n, The more people dressed by the same company, the more classy the wedding will look - and the less you'll stick out.\n\n, Men: Don't tuck in your shirt, strap a belt across it. And wear the belt under your belly, if you have a belly. It just looks silly when someone tries to girdle in their gut with a leather strap. It should go where your pants belt goes. Ask someone who does medieval re-enactment or a friend who is a history buff to help you try on the clothing. Some things that look like they go on easily don't. Corsets lace in the back, belts wrap around you twice, and men look very silly if they tuck in their shirt, since the shirt has a billowy loose bottom.\n\n, Find out if the venue has somewhere you can change, or at worst, wear some of the costume and put on the parts you can't wear in the car (corset, belt, etc) once you get there.\n\n, One of the best parts of medieval clothing is that you can wear loose pants or skirts that hide your shoes entirely, and medieval clothing never, ever had high heels until well after the Victorian era. Do not, under any circumstances, wear a traditional gown with heels. You'll be very off balance, more likely to fall, and look ridiculous.\n\n, By the end of the day you might be relieved to put on a pair of jeans and a sweater. Being stuck in something you're not used to wearing might be frustrating or even embarrassing if you're pulled over or have to stop for food. People who wear that kind of clothing all the time for fairs or re-enactments are used to being looked at funny in the 7-Eleven, but it might be pretty humiliating if you aren't.\n\n, Otherwise, sell it on Etsy or eBay.

{"text":" Aim for eight hours of sleep the first night after the cold starts coming on. A full night's rest improves immune function, making it easier for your body to fight off the invading virus.If you cannot get a full night's sleep, take a 20 to 30 minute nap in the middle of the day to force your body into rest-mode.\nIf possible, skip work or school at the onset of your cold in order to get more rest.Staying home can also prevent the virus from spreading to other people.;\n, Fluids can also break up congestion and ease symptoms.\n\n\nYou should drink at least eight to ten 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water each day, especially when you notice a cold coming on.\nWater, caffeine-free teas, sports drinks, pure fruit juices, clear broth, and ginger ale are all acceptable and beneficial for colds.\nLimit drinks with caffeine or alcohol in them, as these are diuretics that can cause dehydration.\nGreen tea and peppermint tea are both thought to contain properties that can help boost your body's defenses while expelling germs from the body., Dryness can help cold viruses linger and thrive, so filling the air with moisture can cut down on the length of your cold.Adding moisture can also ease your symptoms by preventing your nasal passages from feeling dry and sore.\n\n\nRun a humidifier in the room you spend most of your time in or take a hot shower to create plenty of steam.\nWarm moisture can be especially helpful.\n\n, Consuming healthy calories is also essential early on so that your body has enough energy to fight the virus.\n\n\nMake sure to drink the broth as well. The hot liquid contains a vast amount of the soup's nutrition and will also help keep you hydrated.\n\n,\n\n\nPossible negative side effects include upset stomach, nausea, abdominal pain, and mouth irritation. People who take intranasal zinc have also been known to permanently lose their sense of smell.At most, zinc may only trim a day off the duration of your cold.\nZinc supplements are available in liquid drop form, tablet form, lozenge form, and as intranasal spray.\n\n, Lemon juice contains high levels of vitamin C, and the acidic nature of the juice can also help soothe your early symptoms and reduce the amount of phlegm.By reducing the amount of phlegm, you may be able to prevent the virus from settling in and causing a long-lasting infection.\nSqueeze a lemon wedge into your tea or sip on lemonade.\nYou can also enjoy tea that combines lemon and honey for an even stronger benefit.\n\n, Some researchers believe that ginger promotes healthy sweating, which can help boost your immune system at the start of a cold. By stimulating perspiration, ginger can cleanse your system and help lower your body temperature.Sweat contains dermcidin, a germ-fighting agent that may provide protection against invading microorganisms. The ability to protect your body from these invaders is strongest when you sweat a little, which ginger can help promote.\nSteep a few slices of fresh ginger in hot water for several minutes to create an herbal tea. You could also consume foods containing ginger.\n\n, Garlic contains allicin, a compound thought to boost the immune system and relieve cold symptoms. Some studies indicate that garlic may even help fight viruses and prevent future colds from happening to you.You can prepare a garlic \"tea\" by crushing one or two cloves of garlic and letting the garlic steep in hot water for several minutes.\nYou can also increase your garlic intake by consuming foods prepared with garlic. Add a little garlic to your chicken soup or help yourself to a slice of garlic toast.\n\n, But studies seem to indicate that Echinacea and goldenseal are most effective when used as soon as you feel a cold coming on.\n\n\nTake a liquid tincture of Echinacea or goldenseal since it seems to be more effective than the capsule form of these herbs.\nIf you are taking any medications, check with your doctor to verify that it is safe to take these herbal supplements. Herbs can negatively interfere with some medications.\n\n, Have a bowl of chili or add a dash of hot sauce to your next meal. Spicy foods temporarily open the sinus passages, which can relieve congestion and keep the mucus flowing.Note that this is most effective when your early symptoms start in your nose rather than your throat. By keeping your sinus passages as clear as possible, you can help prevent infection from setting in and encourage the expulsion of the cold virus.\n\n, Manually flushing out germs can promote a speedy recovery.\n\n\nSqueeze the bulb syringe to fill it with saline fluid and place the tip in your nostril about 1\/4 to 1\/2 inch (6 to 12 mm) deep. Slowly release the bulb to empty the saline into your nose.\nIf you cannot get to the store to buy saline nasal solution, make your own by combining 1\/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt with 1\/4 tsp (1.25 ml) baking soda and 8 oz (250 ml) warm water. Use it in conjunction with a Neti pot for best results and make sure you always use water that has been filtered, distilled, or boiled for at least a minute.\nMake sure to rinse the syringe after each application and let it air dry. Doing so can prevent re-exposure to the same germs.\n\n,\n\n\nWhile decongestants often help soothe your symptoms, they may or may not help shorten the length of your cold. By easing your symptoms, however, you improve your odds of staying well-rested, which can increase your body's overall ability to fight off the virus faster.\nNote that decongestants can increase heart rate. They may also cause anxiety and insomnia in some individuals. If you are taking prescription medication for any condition, consult a pharmacist prior to purchasing medication to ensure no interactions will affect you negatively.\n\n,\n\n\nAntihistamines are generally considered allergy medicines but they stop sneezing and reduce drainage more effectively than a decongestant does. By drying up the mucus, an antihistamine limits the amount of time the virus comes into contact with the lining of your nose. This may cut down on the length of your cold as a result.\nAs with other treatments, the sooner you start taking the medication, the stronger the effect will be.\nNote that antihistamines tend to make people drowsy. Those that also contain a decongestant tend to minimize this drowsiness, however. You can look for non-drowsy antihistamines. Avoid using antihistamines if you are driving or work with heavy machinery.\n\n, Since your symptoms are mildest at the onset of your cold, take the time to squeeze in some light exercise \u2014 like brisk walking, in two to three 10-minute stretches.\n\n\nYoga and other gentle exercises can be performed instead of walking. These options may even be better if the weather outside is too nasty for a walk.\nTake precautions if the weather is chilly or rainy. Bundle up in order to keep yourself dry and warm.\nTaking a walk outside on a sunny day can also grant you the opportunity to absorb some vitamin D from the sun, thereby giving your immune system another added boost.\n\n, Vitamin C does boost the immune system, however, and some research suggests that it may shorten the duration of symptoms if taken at the beginning of a cold.\n\n\nVitamin C can be taken in supplement form or it can be consumed naturally through food and drink. Most fruits contain high doses of vitamin C. This is especially true of citrus fruits.\n\n, It also has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, which can offer further help in speeding up your body's healing response.\n\n\nTake a spoonful of honey when you notice your first symptoms in order to give your immune system a quick jolt.\nHoney is especially soothing if your first symptoms begin in your throat.\nYou can mix honey into your tea, coffee, or water as well.\n\n, Acidophilus and other active cultures in yogurt can put healthy bacteria back into your body, thereby strengthening your immune system. These beneficial bacteria can help stimulate the production of various immune system substances that help your body fight diseases.Yogurt is especially effective at returning healthy bacteria to your gastrointestinal tract, where much of your immune function actually occurs.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":527}

A person with cryptococcosis is not contagious., This tiny (microscopic) fungus similar to yeast (previously known to grow in the environment of certain warm, tropical countries) is parasitic and causes serious diseases in humans and animals. Why the fungus appeared on the east coast of Vancouver Island, B.C. in 1999 is not clear. It may have been imported or it may have always existed on Vancouver Island and increased in prevalence due to some climate or environmental changes.\n\n\nVarious Cryptococcus fungus are found growing and spreading in the environment in B.C. and in other places including tropical and subtropical climates in countries such as Brazil and Australia. The C. gattii variety of the cryptococcal fungus lives \"on trees and in the soil\". It was discovered due to finding recent human and animal cases of cryptococcusis, fungal illness, in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health Department Regions, and it is now being found in other areas as well.In Washington State, U.S.A., C. gattii was first identified in cats in 2005; since that time dogs, cats and pet birds have been found to be infected. A small number of human cases have been reported from western Washington.It is not certain how Cryptococcus gattii spread from Vancouver Island to the North American mainland. It may have been transported through the air or on people, vehicles and products traveling from the Island to the mainland. More recently it has been found in the states of Washington and Oregon, as well as in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Regions.\n\n, The C. neoformans and C. grubii cause illness mainly in people with \"impaired immune systems\". On the other hand, C. gattii can cause illness in otherwise healthy people as well as those with impaired immunity. Although C. gattii infection is rare, several Washington residents were recently discovered to be infected by C. gattii., About 25 people become sick from cryptococcosis every year in B.C., Canada.

{"text":" Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them.\n\nBarely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released.,\n\nCaution: with the negative terminal of the battery disconnected. aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution: the TDC could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up (\"It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke.\"); so then align it as explained next.\nCaution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (\"top of the compression stroke\").\nNewer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the \"number one spark plug hole\" by a \"compression gauge\" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.\nRequired: securely place a \"plastic\/rubber\" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably \"not real cork\" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the \"rubber stop-block.\" Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will \"turn\" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two \"open-end\" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).\n\n, Put on the parking brake.,, Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only.,, Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft.

{"text":" There are many types of game shows on the market, and you need to decide which genre your show will belong to. Types of game shows include:\n\n\nTrivia games like Jeopardy and Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?Puzzle games like Playmania and ConcentrationWord games like Wheel of Fortune and The Last WordPhysical competition games like American Gladiators and Battle DomePerformance competition shows like American Idol and America\u2019s Got Talent;\n, You need to find a way to set your show apart from all the other game shows on the market \u2014 you need to create an angle for yourself. The worst thing you can do is model yourself 100% off of an existing show, but you can mix and match aspects from different shows into a format unique to your own.\n\n\nDo your contestants win prize money or object prizes (like a car or a free trip to the Bahamas)? Maybe they win a donation to a charity of their choice, like many \u201ccelebrity\u201d episodes of established game shows.\nYou might narrow the scope of your game show to a specific theme: for example, a game show specifically about college football, aimed toward a sports-loving audience.\nDo your contestants get the opportunity to try to dig themselves out of a hole by fighting back over a series of rounds, or does the contestant with the lowest score get eliminated at the end of each round?\n\n, You don\u2019t want your game show to be over too quickly, but you don\u2019t want it to drag on forever, either. At minimum, your game should last at least half an hour to ensure that enough questions get asked and answered to make the audience feel like they\u2019ve had a satisfying experience. If your show goes over an hour in length, they might start getting bored and stop paying attention.\n\n, By providing a little bit of structure to the competition, you give the competitive nature of the show a narrative arc. At the end of each round, the audience can measure where the contestants stand in relation to one another; this raises the tension as to who will ultimately win.\n\n\nMake sure each round is long enough to be fully developed \u2014 at least ten minutes each. The number of rounds will depend on the length of the show \u2014 a shorter show might have only two rounds, while a longer show might have four.\nThe rounds should be roughly the same length in time.\nYou can increase the point value for questions as rounds progress, making it more difficult for winners to maintain their lead and easier for the others to catch up; this increases the drama for the audience.\nYou can have a final round that is significantly shorter in length, but provides an opportunity to the contestants to dramatically shift the final score.\nThis might include a single question that is worth a large number or points, or perhaps allow contestants to wager how many points they\u2019d like to risk on their final answer.\n\n, Do you want your contestants to go into head-to-head individual competition, or do you want your show to pit teams of contestants against one another? If you\u2019re going to have teams, do you want to randomly arrange teams from the pool of contestants, or have friends who already know each other apply together as a single team?\n\n, All quiz games, from the weekly trivia game at your local bar to Jeopardy, divide their questions into themed categories.\n\n\nCategories can be as broad or specific as you like, but have a good mixture of the two.\nExamples of broad categories might include: science, history, music, or politics.\nExamples of more specific categories might include: endangered species, World War II, punk music, or U.S. presidents.\nAlthough you can repeat categories from time to time, vary them as much as possible between episodes. You don\u2019t want contestants to be able to predict what types of questions you\u2019re going to ask, and you don\u2019t want your audience to get bored.\n\n, A successful quiz show relies on the consistent production of high quality questions. It\u2019s important that you have a large bank of questions to draw from, and that you do all the research necessary for the show ahead of time, so you don\u2019t get caught unprepared.\n\n\nDevelop more questions than you need. You can always save some questions for the future. This strategy also gives you to option to choose the best, most interesting questions from a larger pool rather than making do with the first handful of questions that came to mind.\nWork ahead of time. Don\u2019t put off research for the last second, as you may run into a time crunch\nOrganize a team of researchers. Draw on the strengths of each individual researcher and delegate specific categories to them. For example, researchers with scientific backgrounds should develop science-themed questions, which researchers with English backgrounds should develop literature-themed questions.\nFollow a research schedule. Don\u2019t allow yourself to get off track during the week if you plan a weekly show. After delegating responsibility to your research team (or simply concretizing the categories for yourself), set deadlines for when questions will be due.\nFor example, if you have a team, you might set a mid-week deadline for a pool of questions three times the size of what you need for the episode. Two days before the episode, you must winnow that pool down to the questions you will actually use that week.\n\n, Although you can find websites where trivia-type questions are provided fairly easily, you should only use them as a last resort, because everyone has access to that same bank of generic questions.Audiences and contestants will be far more engaged with interesting, challenging questions that can\u2019t be found in a generic trivia bank, but which you or your team found through thoughtful research.\n\n, When developing your questions, keep your audience in mind. Steer clear of topics that might bore them; for example, an entire category devoted to the periodic table of elements might get tiresome.\n\n\nConsider who you\u2019re writing this show for. Depending on your demographic, you\u2019ll need to develop different strategies to attract viewer interest.\nIf the show is geared toward teenagers, you can develop questions about pop music, movies, or young adult novels.\nIf the show meant for people who wish to watch academically rigorous competition, focus on the types of subjects taught in university classes: philosophy, political science, etc.\nQuestions about topical events and stories currently in the news can also make your viewers perk up.\n\n, If the questions are consistently too difficult for your contestants to answer, you might see a decrease in potential contestants. Furthermore, the audience will likely grow bored with the show if contestants are consistently unable to field the questions.\n\n\nWhile it\u2019s good to have challenging questions from time to time \u2014 ones that are designed to stump everyone \u2014 the majority of your questions should skirt the fine line between challenging and obscure.\nYou can rank the questions within each category by difficulty, beginning with easier questions and building up to more difficult ones.\n\n, Although the talent of your contestants is the real selling point in this genre of game show, you also want to vary the challenges enough to both keep them on their heels and keep your audience engaged. Before you even begin filming your pilot episode, plan out the challenges you want your contestants to complete for the entire season of your show.\n\n, Many performance competition game shows focus on skills that have a revered tradition with well-loved classics. If your game show falls into this category, the people who watch your show might respond well to watching modern-day contestants pay homage to the tradition of their art.\n\n\nFor a cooking game show, have contestants recreate classical dishes with a long tradition, such as chicken cordon bleu or a croquembouche.For a singing game show, have contestants sing old standards that demonstrate their ability to step into a song imbued with someone else\u2019s legacy \u2014 Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cChain of Fools\u201d or Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNew York, New York,\u201d for example.\n\n, While it takes a great deal of skill to execute a classical standard, asking your contestants to bring their own personality and point of view to a well-loved classic presents an interesting challenge.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, you might ask competitors to create new choreography for a song that has a beloved performance already associated with it \u2014 Gene Kelly\u2019s performance of \u201cSinging in the Rain,\u201d for example., While you want to design many of your challenges to highlight your contestants\u2019 creativity and innovation, showcasing their technical skills can also enthrall viewers.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, see how many pirouette turns dancers can do without losing their balance, for example.\n\n, Sometimes, it\u2019s hard to challenge a skilled batch of contestants. A good way to put pressure on them when challenging their technical abilities is to place a time restriction on their task.\n\n\nFor a cooking game show, for example, you might see which contestant can Brunoise dice a pile of vegetables most quickly with an even cut., Though some of the challenges can be about technical proficiency, design other challenges to set contestants up in a way that allows them to showcase their personalities.\n\n\nOn a cooking game show, you might ask contestants to cook a dish that speaks to them from their childhood.\nOn a singing game show, you might challenge the contestants to compose their own songs rather than simply perform those of others.\n\n, In some fields, such as singing and dancing, it may be more difficult to demonstrate innovation because the performers are not necessarily the ones composing or choreographing the pieces. However, if your show showcases a field where your contestants can push the envelope in their industry, design challenges that lead them toward innovation.\n\n\nFor a fashion design game show, ask contestants to create an evening look geared toward women ten years from now.\nFor a cooking show, ask contestants to deconstruct a simple dish or simplify a complex dish.\n\n, Although you want your contestants to be able to demonstrate their own personalities and styles, you also want to see how they can adapt to a wide variety of constraints.\n\n\nFor a dancing game show, have them work in styles from ballet to hip hop to classical Indian folk dance.\nHave cooking game show contestants cook vegan dishes one week, then break down and butcher sides of beef for their own steak dishes the next.\n\n, There are a number of different ways you can test contestants\u2019 strength in that are more entertaining than simply having them lift weights in a gym. Some examples might include:\n\n\nPutting them through a classic childhood exercise like a wheelbarrow race; not only do the contestants have to prove their arm strength over a long distance, but the audience can enjoy laughing along with grown contestants engaging in childish games.Recreate a fun state fair environment by having contestants throw balls at targets for prizes; however, the balls should be heavy medicine balls, and the targets should be far away.\nUse your imagination \u2014 there are any number of ways to have fun while challenging muscle strength.\n\n, You can have them compete head on in simple racing heats, or you can make it a little more interesting by asking them to complete unrelated tasks during their race. For example, contestants sprint for 50 yards, solve a riddle that\u2019s taped to a card at the 50 yard point, sprint back to the starting point, solve a math problem, sprint up a deck of stadium stairs, recite the alphabet backwards, then sprint back to the starting point. Again, you can jazz up the contest however you want, but you want to showcase your contestants\u2019 speed.\n\n, This skill set might have the most potential for entertainment value in a game show setting. You might have contestants engage in an old fashioned pie toss, a dunk tank, or an overgrown, amped up game of dodgeball. A bonus round challenge might be to award extra points to whichever contestant can hit a full-court basketball shot first.\n\n, Obstacle courses raise the stakes by forcing contestants out of their comfort zone. You might set up a military-style outdoor obstacle course, with climbing walls, balance beams, lift-and-carry exercises, and dead sprints.You might aim instead for a funnier tone, booby-trapping contestants with water balloons or flour bombs at points throughout the obstacle course.\n\n\nThe benefit of an obstacle course is that it tests many elements of your contestants\u2019 fitness at the same time, rather than isolating strength from speed from coordination.\nMake sure your contestants are safe at all times. Use rubber pads on any hard walls or objects contestants might run into, and don\u2019t aim projectiles at them that could inflict injury if it made contact.\n\n, Whether you\u2019re trying to sell your game show to a major network or local broadcast television, or even just filming it to upload on Youtube, you will need help from a team of people to make your game show a reality. You will need, at minimum:\n\n\nCamera operators \u2014 you need enough camera angles to show the host and all of the contestants. If you have individual contestants, you might just need two camera operators \u2014 one for the host and one for all of the contestants. However, if you have multiple teams, you might need a camera operator dedicated to each team.\nA production editor \u2014 someone who is familiar with video production software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut.\nA sound technician \u2014 someone who can ensure that the sound quality of all the dialogue on the show is picked up clearly.\nA charismatic host \u2014 the host you choose will set the tone for your show. Whether you pay someone, ask a friend to help you out, or go for it yourself, you need to make sure that the host brings a high level of energy to the proceedings\n\n, The host should introduce each contestant by name, asking them to share a little about themselves. This biographical information can be cut and dry (\u201cMy name is Amy, and I\u2019m an accountant for the city of Austin\u201d) or more whimsical (\u201cMy name is Amy, and I have a cat who likes to go hiking with me on a leash every weekend\u201d).\n\n, Even if your show has been running for a while, you may have new viewers on a given week who are unfamiliar with it. It\u2019s a good practice to introduce the show by briefly explaining the rules and format of the game at the top of each to make sure everyone knows what\u2019s going on.\n\n\nCreate a set script for the introductory rule explanation. This will both ensure that the rules are clearly stated every episode and create a comfortable, familiar segue into the episode for returning viewers.\n\n, If this is a televised show, there will be consistent breaks for commercials \u2014 but even if your show is online, it\u2019s a good idea to allow resting spots every once in a while, ideally between rounds.\n\n\nWhen a round ends, the host should recap the scores at that point in the game.\nThis is a good time for the host to comment on how the game is going so far, or to ask the contestants how they\u2019re feeling about their performance.\nThese little breaks will give both the audience and the contestants time to reset for the next round of competition.\n\n, If your show has a format that changes from round to round, make sure your host explains the new rules at the beginning of each round. You might have a stable format for each different round, like Jeopardy or Chopped, or you might have completely different challenges in each round from week to week, like Project Runway or Top Chef.\n\n, The audience wants to like the people they\u2019re watching, especially the host who remains a constant from episode to episode. Make sure the host is personable throughout, joking with contestants, complimenting them when they do something well, and allowing them to display their personalities.\n\n, As each episode draws to a close, the host should thank the contestants for participating and congratulate the winner on their victory. Take a brief moment before the show ends to thank the audience for watching the show, and invite them to join you again for your next episode. Tell them the date, time, and channel on which the show appears so they know exactly when and where they can find the next episode.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":533}

About twenty to thirty minutes after the paste is applied, the henna will lose its shine and the mud will dry and begin to crack.\n\nApply the lemon and sugar mixture gently with a clean cotton patch to that part where henna has been applied; so that the henna does not get dry and fall off. This lemon sugar mixture will create protective \u201cglue\u201d between your skin and the henna. Be careful not to over saturate the paste as designs can run and bleed together.

A pot of boiling water or tea kettle works well or heat 2 to 3 cloves on an iron pan and put your hands over its fumes. The extra heat and steam help to deepen the stain color., After the paste has been on your skin for 6 \u2013 12 hours it is ready to be removed. Peel off wrappings and scrape off the paste. Using a paper towel and vegetable oil (corn, olive, and canola) or lemon juice, gently rub off the dried henna paste if it is sticking to the skin. Do not use water to remove the paste, it can ruin the tattoo., Once you have unwrapped and removed the dry henna paste you will see an orange-yellow tattoo stain left on your skin. The tattoo will deepen into a richer reddish-brown tone over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin). Moisturizing with natural oils, such as olive, sesame seed, or coconut, will also help extend the lifetime of the tattoo, as skin exfoliation is what causes the henna tattoo to fade.\nIt is best to avoid water for the first 24 hours.\n\n, Corn, canola, or olive oil all work well. Avoid using any petroleum products such as baby oil or Vaseline as they will contribute to the demise of your stain.\n\nAvoid excess rubbing of the area.\nAvoid shaving over your henna\/mehendi stain. Shaving removes layers of skin.\n\n, The color becomes darker within 2 hours. But that color will only last for 2 days. It is the last possible remedy.

{"text":" You should always prepare your hair for cornrows\/weave prior to executing the style. Wash your hair as you normally do, and give it a good conditioning treatment as well. Make sure that your hair is totally dry before starting the cornrow process.;\n, To create the base to sew your weave onto, you have to braid your head in a series of cornrows. To do this, you\u2019ll need a wide tooth comb, a fine tooth comb, and a hair pick. You will also need 2-3 large hair clips to hold your hair away from your face, and a detangle spray of some sort (3 parts water mixed with 1 part oil in a spray bottle works well).\n\n, When you add your weave, you\u2019ll place it in layers around a part in your natural hair. Your part is the exposed area of the scalp, and is typically located down the center of your head or slightly off-center. Choose the location of the part, and separate out \u00bd-inch sections of hair on either side of it. Pin the rest of your hair back using the clips.\n\n\nYour part only needs to go about halfway back on your head.\n\n, To show your part, you will braid two rows of hair on either side of the part, away from each other. Start with one of the \u00bd inch sections of hair, and separate a small piece about \u00bc of an inch thick on one of the ends. Braid this in a french braid towards the ear on the same side of the part. Braid this strand about \u2154 of the way down, leaving the ends loose (they will be incorporated into a larger braid later on).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Work down both sides of the part, braiding small french braids \u00bc-inch wide. Remember that the braids should always go towards the ear on the side of the part they are on; this will expose the straight part down the center. Because you won\u2019t be able to french braid each strand all the way, the ends should stick out after you\u2019ve braided all the hair near the scalp. Each of the strands that are sticking out will be the start of a row of braids going all the way around your head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The first braid you will complete is a small braid that wraps around the outer edge of your face, head, and to the nape of your neck. The perimeter braid will have two starts - on either side of the part - but you will combine the ends of the braids together at the nape of your neck. Take your hair out of the hair clips, and section off a strand of hair \u00bc-\u00bd inch thick all the way around the outer edge of your head. Starting with the edge-braid from your part, braid as far as you can around the edge of your head. Then, do the same on the other side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might combine the perimeter braids off to the side rather than directly in the center on the nape of your neck, if your part is off-center.\nKeep the braid as tight as you can, and as close to your scalp as you\u2019re able.\n\n, Each of the braids you began on either side of your part will continue on to form full braids that wrap around your head. This means that from a birds-eye-view of your completed head, there will be concentric circles formed around your part. Follow the pattern of the perimeter braid, by sectioning off thin pieces of hair around the outer edge and working in. Go to the next braid closest to your hairline, and braid on either side of your part towards the back of your head.\n\n\nContinue spraying your hair with the oil\/water mixture or your detangler spray to make braiding easier.\nYour braids should be very tight and may hurt while braiding, but shouldn\u2019t be painful when completed.\nThe braids will likely become quite thick about halfway through, because of all the hair you gather. Don\u2019t be worried if because of this your braids are uneven.\n\n, Work inwards on your braids, away from your part. Each of the small braids you started on either side of your part should serve as the start for each new braid. If you run out of part-braids though, you can create more near the part on the back of your head. Tie off all the ends and tuck them into\/under the finished braids so as to hide the tails.\n\n, For your weave, you\u2019ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You\u2019ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you\u2019ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well.\n\n, Get your special weave-thread out, and cut a piece that is 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) long. Thread one end of the string through your needle, and pull it so that both ends are even. Then, wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of your finger, and tie them together in a knot. This will form a loop on which your needle is strung. Cut the excess thread off that is left over from tying your knot; try to cut it as close to the knot as you are able, so as to make it as discreet as possible when woven into your hair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t cut too much thread to start, as the longer your thread, the more tangles and knots that are likely to be formed.\nYou\u2019ll probably run out of thread often, so you\u2019ll have to repeat the aforementioned process each time that happens.\n\n, Pull your wig cap out and stretch it out, sliding it over your head. Cover your entire hairline all the way around; the wig cap should go over your ears, forehead, and the nape of your neck as bit so as to make sure your braids are completely covered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Start at the beginning of your perimeter braid near the part, and pull the needle under the braid and through the other side, pulling the thread taut against the knot. Then, pull the end of the knot out just a bit and pull the two strings apart to expose the loop. Wrap the needle around one edge of the loop twice, and pull it through the center of the loop to create the base knot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid.\n\n\nEach knot should be about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm) apart from each other.\nMake sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids.\n\n, When you\u2019ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you\u2019ll complete the \u2018loop\u2019 by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you\u2019ve sewn around the part, you should have a large \u2018U\u2019 shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid.\n\n\nThe finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you\u2019ve been sewing the whole time.\nCut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.\n\n, Take your shears and cut up along your part to split the wig cap. You\u2019ll be removing all the excess fabric around the edge of your sewing (the part that went over your forehead, ears, nape of your neck, and the covers your part). Once you\u2019ve cut up your part, cut all the extra fabric off as close to the edge of your thread as possible, without getting close enough to cut the knots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you accidentally cut the thread or a knot, you\u2019ll have to remove what work you\u2019ve done and start over with a new wig cap.\n\n, The first extension that you will measure and apply is the piece that goes around the perimeter. Take your extensions out of the package, and open one weft so that all the hair is exposed. Starting at the beginning of your perimeter braid, hold the extension in place, and wrap it around your head. Hold it to the perimeter braid the entire time to make sure it is the right length. When you get to the end of the perimeter braid on the other side, measure a little extra hair, and then trim it to fit.\n\n\nPlace this piece of perimeter-extension off to the side, so that you don\u2019t misplace it or confuse it for another section of hair.\n\n, The second major section of hair you need to measure is the piece that will go around the \u2018U\u2019 shape of your part. Hold the end of the extension over the beginning of the \u2018U\u2019 shaped part near your forehead, and wrap it around where you have already knotted. When you get to the end on the other side (back to your forehead), add a little extra length to your measurement, and then cut the piece of extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep track of this extension, and make sure you don\u2019t confuse it with the perimeter extension.\n\n, You\u2019re going to be working with a long strip of extension, but you won\u2019t be able to use all the necessary thread in a single shot. Cut a piece of your weave thread that is 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8\u00a0m) long, and use the same process as you did for your wig cap by threading it through the needle, matching the ends, and tying them together in a knot. Cut off any excess string.\n\n, Every time you section out a new piece of extension to sew on, you\u2019ll have to create a knot to secure it. The extension is made up of two primary parts: the strands of hair, and the weft which holds them together. Stick your needle through the weft at the very beginning of the extension to secure it. To tie your first knot, you\u2019ll wrap the needle around, pull it through the weft a second time, wrap the loop that is formed around the needle twice, and pull the needle through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe knotting process involved is the same as you used to sew your wig cap to your cornrows.\nYou should have plenty of excess thread when you\u2019re finished tying your not; don\u2019t cut this, as you will be using it to weave your extension to your head.\n\n, Start at the very beginning of your perimeter braid near your part, and insert the needle through the wig cap, under the perimeter braid, and up through the other side. Pull it tight to bring your extension piece close to your head. Then, make your first knot by wrapping the needle\/thread around the weft (not through it) and repeating the same knotting process as you used for sewing your cap. Repeat your knot twice to secure the extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll only double-knot the extension at the very beginning.\n\n, Using the exact same process as you did to sew on the wig cap, work around your head sewing on the extensions that attach to the perimeter braid. Make each knot about 1-inch apart, and hold the extensions taut so that they are securely attached to your head. Do this all the way around your perimeter braid until you\u2019ve made it to the very end, on the opposite side of your part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful not to tie strands of hair into the knot.\nTrim off any excess that you might have once you have completed sewing on the perimeter extension.\n\n, To finish off the \u2018border\u2019 of your hair, you\u2019ll have to sew your extension piece around the edge of the \u2018U\u2019 shape that your wig cap forms around your part. Start by preparing a new piece of thread and attaching it to the end of the weft. Then use the exact same process as explained above to sew the extension to the braids\/wig cap around your part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrim off any extra that you might have at the end.\n\n, Starting at the second row of braids (the second to the perimeter braids) you should begin filling in the space on your head with the rest of your extensions. Continue the same process as above, except that when you get to the end of your row (on the opposite side of the perimeter braid), you should use the \u2018fold over\u2019 method to begin an additional row. This means that instead of cutting off the excess extension when you reach the end of a row, you fold it back on itself and begin sewing the new row directly above it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways sew a knot directly over a fold when you fold over a section, in order to make it lay flat. It is helpful to do this twice, to make sure it is 100% secure.\nDon\u2019t measure and cut your pieces prior to sewing additional rows, because the fold-over method will make it easier to continue working with the same weft for a large portion of your head.\n\n, Work around your head, using the exact same process of sewing your weave to your cap\/braids as you have been. Remember to always double knot over a fold or the beginning of a weft, to properly secure it. When you have finished filling in your head, trim off any excess that might hang over the front., If you\u2019ve done all of your sewing correctly so far, you should be left with about 1-inch of exposed braids all the way around your part. Sewing your weave onto this section is similar to when you originally braided it, as you will be working with small sections away from the part. Measure the exposed braid, and cut off the same amount of your weave. Sew each small section (about 1-inch wide) onto the exposed braid. This means that you will have many small pieces to sew, and each should run somewhat parallel to your forehead. Use the exact same process, making sure to double-knot both the beginning and end of each thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be helpful to have several needles with thread prepared before starting this, because you\u2019ll be working with so many small pieces of weave which may be difficult to do with a single long piece of thread.\nAs the layers build, your part should look more and more natural, and the weft of each piece of extension should begin to be covered up.\n\n, When you\u2019ve sewn on extensions to all the small braids along your part, you should be left with a space in the back that is still open. To fill this in, you\u2019ll have to prepare a special piece of your weave. Measure the space that you have to fill, and cut a piece of your weave that is twice that length. Start with your regular double knot at the end, and then roll the weave in to create a small circle. Create an additional knot by looping around the two layered sections of weft, and pulling it tight. Continue rolling and knotting the extension until you have finished the whole piece.\n\n\nWhen you tie the last knot, pull the needle through all of the layered wefts to secure them together.\nCut the excess string off when you\u2019re finished tying it.\n\n, Turn your closure piece upside down so that the weft is facing the ground, and the hair is upwards. Begin flattening the hair so that it falls down over the top of the rolled up weft. Because of the roll that you created, the hair should fall evenly around it, hiding the weft and your sewing. It may be helpful to use a flat iron on the hair to get it to cooperate with what you\u2019re trying to get it to do.\n\n\nSecure the ends of the hair with a small elastic to making sewing it to your scalp much easier.\n\n, Turn your closure piece back over so that the weft is exposed, and insert your needle and thread through it to tie your regular double knot. Bring your closure to your scalp, and place it where you want it to go. Insert your needle through a braid or a piece of weft from another extension nearby on your scalp, and pull it tight to create your regular knot. Continue doing this in a circular movement around your closure piece, until you\u2019ve gotten back to the beginning.\n\n\nCut off the excess string, remove the elastic from your hair, and you\u2019re done!\nAdjust the strands of your closure piece to cover up any weft that may be visible.\n\n, Attaching your weave to your head is now completed, so you have the option of cutting and styling it to your personal preference. Keep in mind that your cut is permanent since your hair isn\u2019t going to grow in, so be very careful about cutting your hair. Maintain your weave regularly, but avoid washing it too often as this may loosen up the ties and your wig cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":536}

{"text":" This will come with a huge power wire, a short ground wire, a remote wire, and many times an inline fuse and various connectors to help keep the install organized and looking clean. Some stereo shops have huge spools of wire available by the foot. This is another cost effective alternative to buying a wiring kit, if you know the dimensions of your car.;\n, You can find a hole somewhere in the bottom right of the firewall. Don't connect the power wire to the battery or the amp just yet.\n\n, You'll need to stay within 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) of the amplifier to maintain the best ground connection. A way you can do this is pull up the carpet and scrape the metal until it is bare metal with no paint left on it. If the amplifier is to be mounted in the trunk, many times bolts from the suspension can be found directly above one of the rear wheels. These suspension components usually bolt directly to the frame, making them an ideal grounding point.\n\n, There is a blue wire with a white stripe hanging out of the back of the deck known as the remote wire. The remote wire is a simple 12v signal that the cd player outputs to tell the amplifier to turn on.\n\n,, If your cd player does not have a \"Subwoofer Output\", or if you are using a stock cd player, you will need a device called an inline converter. It's a small box that has 4 input wires and the 2 necessary RCA output that will run to the amplifier. It takes the high level speaker voltage and drops it to a low level signal the amplifier can process. The 4 input wires can be connected to the rear speakers (+ and - for left and right).\n\n, RCA cables should be run down the center of the car as RCA cables can pick up sounds from wire looms and also air con vents power wires.\n\n, Gauge isn't extremely important here, as long as the wire is copper, the resistance-per-foot is in the mili-ohm range, meaning there will be minuscule, if any, voltage drop across the wire.\n\n, There are many different types of enclosures (sealed, vented, bandpass, infinite baffle, etc.). There are numerous articles explaining the pros and cons of each type of enclosure, far too many to list in this article. If you really want the best response possible, your subwoofer manual will list the ideal enclosure volume for each type of enclosure. If you don't want to go through all of the volume calculations, just buy a box slightly bigger, and stuff it with pillow stuffing from walmart until the subs respond the way you want them to.\n\n, For example, if you have an amp that is 500w @ 4 ohms, and 1000w @ 2 ohms, you'll want to try to run your speakers at 2 ohms. Two 4 ohm subs can be wired in parallel to achieve this. If you're new to the impedance calculations, many amplifiers will have specific wiring diagrams in their manuals to assist.\n\n, If your amp kit came with an \"inline fuse holder\", you'll want to find a nice location to mount it in your engine bay. Once it's secure, cut a length of the power wire to reach the fuse, and connect it to one side of the fuse holder. The other side (the side you just cut) is stripped and connected to the other side of the fuse holder.\n\n, There's nice ring connectors and even new battery terminals you can buy (and sometimes come with the amp kit), that make the battery connection much more solid, and looks better too.\n\n, Then under the hood clamp the wire down to the battery. A word of warning, sometimes you'll see a nice big spark the first time you touch the power wire to the battery. Don't worry about it! This is the amplifier charging the huge capacitors contained inside.\n\n, This is where the output of the amplifier peaks and stays there for a split-second. This is bad for the subwoofer because it holds the cone (the big circle part!) in it's fully extended or fully compressed state for the duration of the clip. Not only are you not producing a single decibel of sound during this microsecond, but you're also working the voice coil very hard and damaging it. A good rule for beginners is to play a nice loud song of your genre at your cd players 3\/4 volume setting. Now, with the gain at zero, turn it up until it's obvious that it isn't getting any louder. The gain knob isn't a \"volume\" knob by any means. A gain knob should usually never be at it's full position.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":538}

{"text":" Butter is best fresh, and in a perfect world, you'd purchase and consume the butter weekly.However, this isn't realistic for many people, so the key is to stick to small amounts, and fast consumption, fitting this in with your usual shopping routine. If you have found butter for a bargain price and don't want to overlook the savings, consider freezing the bulk of any excess butter.\n\n, Butter easily absorbs the odors of other foods, thus it's important to provide a guard against this possibility., Alternatively, if you don't wish to wrap the butter, place it straight into the sealed container in its original packaging; the seal will prevent the transfer of odors and exposure to air.\n\n\nLeft unopened, salted butter will keep for several weeks., Once you start to use it, aim to work through it quickly.\n\n,, While butter can be frozen as a whole block, it is probably more useful to cut it into usable chunk sizes, which will make it easier to thaw quickly and provide just the amount you need each time.\n\n, Ensure that the foil completely covers the butter and overlaps for added protection.\n\n, Alternatively, place it inside a freezer-proof container which is airtight.,, Unsalted butter has a shelf life of three months in the refrigerator (unopened), while it can be frozen for up to six months.Once opened, it will keep for two to three weeks in the refrigerator., If you cannot consume it within this time, you will need to freeze the unsalted butter, to ensure that it stays fresh for longer.\n\n\nWrap the butter well in foil to avoid other flavors from mingling with it.\nBefore wrapping, consider cutting it into smaller chunks that you can remove for use as needed.\nPlace a resealable freezer bag over it to prevent odor penetration.\nPlace in the freezer. Keep it away from any frozen food that might impart a strong odor. As noted, unsalted butter will keep for up to six months in the freezer.\n\n, Butter spoils quickly at room temperature, due to its high water content., The salt as a preservative will help the butter to stay fresher a little longer.\n\n, Store it in a cool, dark and dry cupboard or pantry when not in use. When on the table, keep the lid of the butter dish on when the butter is not being used.\n\n\nAir is the source of turning butter rancid. Hence, keeping the lid on helps to slow down this process.If you like the idea of room temperature storage, consider getting a European storage crock. These come with a water seal that keeps the air out, the moisture in and retains the freshness of the butter for longer (up to two weeks).Inquire about this at your local kitchen store, or check online for providers.\n\n, The butter will go rancid very quickly. For room temperature butter when it is hot, remove only the needed amount from the refrigerator a half hour to an hour before use and place in the butter dish\/keeper; leave to warm at room temperature, with the lid firmly on. Then transfer to the table. Discard what has not been consumed at that meal.\n\n, Ghee has had the milk solids removed. This means that it is less likely to go rancid and has a longer shelf life.\n\n, Provided the room temperature is normal and not too hot, and you intend on using the ghee quickly, it is usually fine to store it at room temperature.If ghee has been made properly and is stored properly, it is possible to store it at room temperature for several decades.However, this is not advisable, as foods are best consumed within a short period of time of their production. If any moisture or milk solids remain in the ghee, it will not store well for a long period of time; it must be pure butter fat for it to stay fresh at room temperature.The container used to hold the ghee must be airtight, opaque and waterproof.Pickling crocks or porcelain jars\/earthenware jars can be used for short-term room temperature storage.Colored glass jars or commercially specific hermetically sealed containers can be used for longer-term room temperature ghee storage., For long-term freshness and absolute certainty, it is a good idea to keep ghee refrigerated, especially once opened, and especially if you've made it yourself.Ensure that it is in an airtight container; it will still absorb the odors of aromatic foods around it.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":542}

This should help you decide whether to take the vehicle into service vs doing this yourself.\n,, You will be in and under the wheel well most of the time., you can remove the plastic rivets with a large screwdriver or stretch the rubber guards over the heads of the rivets., (just aft of the strut). The starter will not fit through this space without moving this brake line first., It is held in place by an O ring. twist and pull the upper section up. It comes out reasonably easy, plug the top of the bottom section with a paper towel as to not contaminate the transmission fluid.,, You will have to go under the truck and come in from behind the starter through a maze of brake lines etc. The swivel headed ratchet makes this job MUCH easier. Using a 12 to 14 inch (30.5 to 35.6\u00a0cm) extension and the same 14mm socket and swivel ratchet remove the top bolt., Depress the plastic locking key and slide the plug out. Fortunately this removed easy, because there is little room to maneuver and no room to use pliers. If you had to use force there is no room for leverage., THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE JOB. I was unable to do it myself and ended up having a Toyota Service supervisor come to my home and assist me. He said only two of his three techs are able to perform this task. The starter needs to be removed gears first, through the wheel well opening, it needs to be lifted (gears up) and rotated toward the opening so that it is removed not quite horizontally. As the starter is moved toward the opening it has to be rotated so the positive battery lead bolt can clear obstructions. The starter is then advanced in position and rotated opposite direction. Advance the starter in position and wiggle it in position until it can be removed. This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds. As I said I was unable to perform this task., You will need an impact driver to take the starter apart and check the bushes (also called lunge contacts). The brushes are usually just over an inch long and spring-loaded, if they appear to have plenty of carbon left then look to your stator. Bluish burns on the copper windings indicate bad spots, and the starter should be replaced. As difficult as this job was, replacing the starter is worth every dime. After market starters are approx. $100. Toyota I believe is closer to $300., wiggle it around until it goes into the engine compartment, maneuver the starter until the gears go into the flywheel housing then line it up and push it into place. It is difficult to tell whether the gears and flywheel mesh, but rotate the starter back and forth and the gears should mesh. Using a 12\u201314 inch (30.5\u201335.6\u00a0cm) flat piece of anything, prop the starter up so that you may start the bolts into the starter housing. I had better success with the lower bolt first, and pulling the starter up to the flywheel housing cautiously to check the gear mesh. Leave the lower bolt loose and start the top bolt. After re-installing the starter, I had difficulty tightening this top bolt. I was able to reach this bolt through the wheel well (with no extension or flex socket) for final tightening. Tighten the bolts checking the gap between the flywheel housing and the starter to ensure the gears meshed properly. If they are coming together unevenly remove either bolt, loosen the other bolt and rotate the starter back and forth until it goes into place. The limited access to the starter makes this process more difficult because of lack of mobility of the starter. Repeat the re-bolting process, and tighten down the bolts. I do not know the torque values if any. I use the tight is tight, too tight is broke, method., Rebolt the brake line bracket, replace the negative battery lead and start the truck.

{"text":" If you plan on driving, don\u2019t drink enough alcohol to raise your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08, which is the legal level for intoxication in every state., Consider using an online calculator, such as the one available at this link. Factors influencing BAC include your gender, weight, and what type of alcohol you drink.The calculator can be a useful tool, but don\u2019t rely on it to be completely accurate.\n\n, Medications affect people differently, so make sure that any prescription (or non-prescription) drugs you take won\u2019t impair your ability to drive., Instead of risking a DUI, call a taxi or ask a friend or family member to pick you up if you\u2019re too impaired to drive. The consequences of a DUI conviction far outweigh the cost of a cab ride.\n\n, Every state has laws that govern driving under the influence. There are certain basic DUI elements that you\u2019ll find in these laws, such as:\n\n\nBAC intoxication levels, some of which can trigger stiffer penalties\nthe possibility of jail time\nfines\nthe possibility of suspension or restriction of driving privileges., This will enable you to learn the specifics of what constitutes a violation of the law where you live. It will also let you know the possible penalties involved. You can look up the laws for your state here.\n\n, If you\u2019ve been arrested for a DUI, the police will most likely let you know some of the details of your arrest, such as your BAC level. If they don\u2019t tell you immediately, you should have access to this information within a few days. Once you have this available, compare it to what you\u2019ve found in your state\u2019s DUI law, to get a better idea of what you're facing. Knowing this may also influence your decision as to whether or not you want to retain an attorney.\n\n, If a police officer stops you, and believes you may be under the influence, he or she will normally administer tests at the scene of the stop. Try to recall as much about this as you can. The typical tests are:\n\n\nNystagmus test. You\u2019ll be asked to shift your eye gaze from one side to another while the officer shines a light in your eyes.\nWalk and Turn (WAT) test. The officer will ask you to walk heel-to-toe on a line, while giving you other instructions.\nOne Leg Stand (OLS) test. You\u2019ll have to stand on one leg for 30 seconds, so the officer can assess balance and coordination.\n\n, If a police officer believes you\u2019re driving under the influence, in all likelihood he or she will want you to take a chemical test. This is usually a breath test, but also could involve a urine or blood sample, depending on the circumstances. All states have laws that require you to take the chemical test (\u201cimplied consent\u201d laws). As with the balance tests, try to remember as much as possible., As soon as you can, make written notes of everything the officer may have told you, and any responses you gave, from the time you were stopped until you were released. This includes how well you believe you did on the balance tests, and what you saw or heard during the chemical test. If the officer said or did anything to imply that you may have been stopped for something other than suspected DUI (such as race or gender), the evidence collected may not be admissible in court. This is also true if the officer didn\u2019t read you your rights after you were arrested., Some attorneys advise against taking any of the field sobriety or chemical tests if you think you'll fail. Depending on your state, you may not be obligated to take the field tests or preliminary breath test at the scene of the stop. But be aware of the following:\n\n\nIf you don't take the formal chemical test at the police station or hospital, this could lead to a legal inference that you're guilty, which can be used against you in court.\nThere are separate penalties for refusing the formal chemical test, such as loss of driving privileges, fines and possibly jail.\nYou could end up with two convictions: DUI and refusal to take the test., If you have been arrested for DUI, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you. A criminal defense attorney can help you challenge your stop and arrest and will help you craft and make logical legal arguments.\n\n\nIf you can afford a criminal defense attorney, hire one who concentrates on DUI defense. There are plenty of DUI attorneys out there so look for one with excellent communication skills, a good record of success, and great ethics. In general, a DUI defense at this stage will cost between $1,000 and $5,000. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.\nIf you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.\n\n, In order to stop a driver, an officer must have \u201cprobable cause\u201d, such as erratic driving, for example. If probable cause didn\u2019t exist, the stop could be declared illegal, and the evidence against you may be inadmissible in court.You should also note that some states have outlawed DUI roadblocks or checkpoints. So if this was the reason for your stop, check to see if it's permitted in your state., The officer will need a basis for his or her suspicion that you were under the influence. Usually these are facts such as an odor of an alcoholic beverage, slurred speech, and\/or watery or bloodshot eyes. It might help your case if you were able to prove that none of these tell-tale signs existed, or that if they did, there were other, reasonable explanations for them. (Such as using mouthwash or having allergies.), An officer can establish probable cause for the administration of a chemical test, or even an arrest, if you fail the field sobriety tests. It can help your case if you can show that the tests weren\u2019t valid field sobriety tests, or that the results were inaccurate. For example, perhaps you failed the Walk-and-Turn test because of a leg injury., If you can prove that any of the chemical tests were improperly administered, or that the results were compromised, you may be able to exclude the results from a trial.The primary basis for challenging chemical tests (i.e., blood or breath tests) relates to what is called the \"blood alcohol curve.\" The blood alcohol curve helps determine what your blood alcohol content is at any given time.To challenge a chemical test, you will generally argue that because of the science behind this curve, your blood alcohol content was lower at the time of the arrest than at the time of your test. You would argue that, at the time of your arrest, your blood alcohol content was below the legal limit but rose above the legal limit while you were being arrested and processed. For more information about the blood alcohol curve look here.\n\n, If you have been arrested for DUI and you are going to trial, you might want to consider hiring an attorney or having an attorney appointed for you.

Lawyers are usually paid on an hourly basis so your costs may be more or less depending on how much work needs to be done. For more information on hiring a criminal defense attorney, look here.\nIf you can't afford an attorney but you still want one, the law requires that you be appointed a public defender. If you have not had a court appearance yet, invoke your right to counsel by telling any law enforcement official that you would like an attorney and that you cannot afford one. If you have already had a court appearance, ask the judge to have an attorney appointed for you.\n\n, If you\u2019ve retained a lawyer, he or she will guide you as to what to expect, and how you should act. If you\u2019re representing yourself, consider going to the courtroom where your trial will be held\u2014before your actual trial date. Go inside when a trial is in progress, and pay attention to how the participants conduct themselves. Even though you may not be a lawyer, and even though a judge may give you a little leeway because of this fact, he or she will expect you to obey court rules and regulations., Make sure you have all your witnesses available for your trial date. If an important witness won\u2019t be able to make it, ask the court if you can postpone your case. If you have a lawyer, he or she will review your testimony and your evidence with you in advance. Whether you\u2019re represented by an attorney or not, have your evidence in order, including all documentation and photos you plan to use. You don\u2019t want your case to fall apart because you left a crucial piece of evidence on the dining room table.\n\n, If the prosecutor in your case is willing, consider a plea agreement. In this situation, you\u2019ll plead guilty to an offense other than DUI. For example, the prosecutor may dismiss the DUI charge if you enter a plea of guilty to reckless driving. The benefit is that you avoid a trial, and you don\u2019t have a DUI on your record. There\u2019s no guarantee, however, that a prosecutor will go along with a plea bargain request., If you don\u2019t have an attorney, introduce your evidence, and make your legal arguments, as professionally as possible. If you\u2019ve retained an attorney, listen to his or her advice at all phases of the trial. Whether with an attorney or without one, always conduct yourself properly. Be courteous to the judge, the prosecutor, and any witnesses. The last thing you want to do is alienate a judge or jury by behaving badly. , If you\u2019ve pleaded guilty to DUI, or were found guilty after a trial, the judge may order you to take certain actions, including participating in alcohol rehabilitation or education programs. This is in addition to the penalties imposed. Following through on these orders is required, and failing to do that could lead to more penalties, including not having your driving privileges reinstated, or even jail., If you have a DUI, at some point down the road you may be able to have that conviction removed (expunged) from your criminal record. Not every state allows a DUI conviction to be expunged, and even if it\u2019s removed from any criminal record, it might still remain on your driving history. It\u2019s probably best to consult an attorney to determine if you\u2019re eligible to have your DUI conviction expunged.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":544}
{"text":" Some aesthetic changes will clash against each other. Even worse, you can run out of space to fit all of the pieces on your car. Run all of the ideas past a car expert before making any financial commitments to them.;\n, If all you're looking for is a better look, you might find a paint job does everything you want it to. Cars can be painted with specialized spray paint in your garage. Due to the value of your vehicle, it's very important to be slow and consistent with your paint.\n\n\nIf you're painting the car from home, don't forget to give your car a primer coat beforehand.Car modification garages can offer more intense paint jobs with graphics like flames. These are very stylized, but make sure your car model is worthy of the flair before you commit to something so flashy. Graphic flames on a Toyota Camry won't get you the sort of attention you're looking for.\n\n, Tinted windows add fast class to a vehicle. The mystery factor and privacy of tinted windows can make even an average car look posh by comparison.\n\n\nBy replacing factory parts, you may void your vehicle's warranty. Check with the manufacturer before proceeding.\n\n, Changing them for a snazzier design is relatively inexpensive by car mod standards. The subtle difference it makes to your vehicle's appearance won't go unnoticed by those who know where to look.\n\n\nMake sure your taillight modifications are road-friendly. Although you can change your car's look by replacing the lights on it, you still want to make sure they comply with road regulations.\n\n, While a lot of car modification focuses on the outside presentation, you can revamp your experience on the vehicle by changing the seating. Most stock car seating is cloth-upholstered. For a fashionable touch, replacing this with leather seats is very luxurious.\n\n\nIf you go with leather seating, make sure you take care to maintain it as leather demands.\n\n, This is because car modders tend to have preferences for certain models over others, and more popular models will have a greater number of readymade options. Even a broken down beater can be souped up into something special if you have the money for it. If it's your first time pimping out a car however, you can make it easier on yourself by picking a mod-friendly vehicle to start with.\n\n\nLook online for some examples of your car model being modded. Some car models will come up with lots of results, while others will draw a blank. The number of results will probably give you an idea whether your car is seen as mod-friendly or not.\n\n, This can be done at a car modification garage. Even a slight drop can have a big effect on the look of your vehicle.\n\n\nOn the other hand, you can boost your suspension up for a more rugged look. This option is popular on trucks and SUVs.\nThere is a safety concern involved in lowering your car's suspension. Although it may look cool, you'll be sacrificing some of your car's handling in the process. Keep this in mind if you are considering lowering suspension. A faster-looking car doesn't necessarily mean a better one.\n\n, Spoilers are meant to give your car the visual impression that it's fast enough to need some aerodynamic support. Of course, for all except the fastest race cars, spoilers are just for show.Even so, many gearheads find the look of a spoiler very appealing on a car. Depending on how common the add-on is to your model, your mechanic specialist may be able to direct you to a spoiler specially suited to the car you want modded.\n\n, A stereo system doesn't change your car's appearance in any significant way, but a new subwoofer will be felt. If you have the money to spend upgrading your car, giving your stereo a facelift will give your vehicle the soundtrack to boot. Best of all, you can be as cheap or expensive as you'd like with reinventing your sound system. A new pair of front speakers might only set you back $50, while a full-blown stereo system can cost you thousands of dollars.\n\n\nBass isn't everything to a stereo system. A rich sound will give you more listening enjoyment than a rig with all its power on the bass end of the spectrum.\nDon't be inconsiderate by blasting your subwoofer in crowded areas.\n\n, Hydraulics are a theatrical twist on your car. With hydraulics, you can boost your car's suspension and make it \"dance\". Hydraulics are a big part of car modder culture, and are preferred on vehicles with low suspension, called low-riders. If you want a playful trick to your car, take it to a garage and get this specialized suspension control installed.\n\n\nHydraulic suspension is pricey, and many outside the car modding community associate it with gang culture.\nIf you're in with a car modding community, you might try joining a car hydraulics \"dance competition\".\n\n, If you are interested in increasing the functionality of your vehicle, getting a higher-quality brand of tire for your vehicle can change your experience of driving it. This is an important trick whether you're a car modding or a \"casual\" car owner.\n\n\nKeep your area's weather in mind when you pick out tires. Some tires are specially designed to function in rain or snow.\nGenerally speaking, the bigger your wheels are, the less responsive they'll be when you're driving.Try to strike a balance between form and function with your tires.\n\n, These computers determine how much fuel is injected into the engine at different RPMs. If you want to get an added boost (and fuel economy) from your car, you can buy an input panel for your ECU and have it installed in your car. Although it's only recommended you change an ECU's default settings if you know what you're doing, you can squeeze some extra power out of your car just by improving the efficiency of parts you already have.\n\n\nBy cutting out fuel at precise times, you can make your car \"backfire\", shooting a burst of flame out the exhaust when you rev it. This is not recommended for street vehicles however, and should only be approached if you know what you're doing.\n\n, Having you exhaust and muffler replaced with something more sleek can help improve the vehicle's efficiency. Some car modders also enjoy playing around with the sound a car makes. Removing a muffler will make your car sound considerably louder. While this might make the car sound faster, it's also inconsiderate to other people using the road.\n\n, However, these erode with time. Replacing them with durable polyurethane may be a largely invisible improvement to your vehicle, but it can do wonders for a vehicle's handling if you've been driving it a while.\n\n, Car modifications can affect your insurance premiums. It's best to look into the ways each modification may affect your insurance before committing to them. Talk to your insurance company if you're unclear., All the same you'll want to keep legality in mind while modding your car to make sure it's not taken away from you once you're on the road.\n\n\nLegality will depend on the specific country you're living in. As a general rule, if your car looks more like it's designed for a racetrack, there's probably something about it that conflicts with regulation.\n\n, At the end of the day, you should make sure you're keeping your car safe and useable. Even if something may look cool, nothing is worth putting your life and others in danger.\n\n, Most tasteful mods will be received positively, while more bombastic changes might be seen as a joke by other street users. Make a point of avoiding inconsiderate mods. Removing your car's muffler vastly increases the noise pollution your car will create, and anything that creates excess smoke should be rightly avoided.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":545}

You can also manually clear off any precipitation that may be impeding your view. You may leave the wiper on, if you feel you need it to continue your journey.\n\n, Look specifically for the gas amount and temperature controls. Although the gas will tend to not be so much of a factor, the car does run for a short time on gas. Temperature ranges are read just like any other car.\n\n, The car will give you a readout in digital form.

This is done by pushing in the pedal furthest to the left which is marked \"Push On Off\".\n\n,,, Recognize that there is no Park position on the gearshift itself.

Look at the joystick-like shifter to the right of the button that powers the car to an on position.\n\n\nWhen the car is in P mode, your dashboard will light up the P mode light (it will place a square around the letter P to the left of the digital speedometer. This selector is positioned in the middle right area of the gear selection knob where there is a large filled dot. This mode is much similar to the Park position on a Automatic Transmission car.\nShift into R mode when you need to reverse the car. However, shifting into R mode will trigger to turn on the rear camera on the vehicle. If you enable the feature by pressing the button, R mode will be the first mode you'll need to shift into to begin a ParkAssist maneuver with your Prius. R mode runs the same way as Reverse does in an another automatic transmission car. This mode is positioned at the top left of the shift column from the shift lever.\nUse the N mode when you need to use the Neutral gear. Shifting into this gear on a flat slope will cause your car not to move anyplace, however on a downward slope the car will start to roll forward without any gas applied. N mode is straight across from P and must be shifted into each and every time to get it out of park and into a drivable gear.\nUse the D mode when you want to drive the vehicle. D mode operates the same way shifting an automatic into Drive does. D mode is in the bottom left corner of the shifting column.\nUse B mode occasionally. The B mode (shown on the gear lever) can also be used to make the car move forwards. When B mode is activated, engine braking is much more pronounced. It can be found immediately under P mode, and you shouldn't need to shift it into any other gear on the left to operate this mode.\n\n,,,,,,,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":548}

They spin, taking power, even when they are not actively being used. Wherever possible, try to run on virtual drives.\n\n, Clean your battery's metal contacts every couple of months with a cloth moistened with rubbing alcohol. This keeps the transfer of power from your battery more efficient.\n\n, Usually, there is a switch, but sometimes you have to do it in the WiFi config.\n\n, Once charged, you should at least use the battery at least once every two weeks.\n\n, Although placing a laptop in standby mode saves some power and you can instantly resume where you left off, it doesn't save anywhere as much power as the hibernate function does. Hibernating a laptop will actually save more power as it will completely shut down itself.\n\n, The faster your hard drive does its work the less demand you are going to put on the hard drive and your battery. Make your hard drive as efficient as possible by defragging it regularly.\n\n, All laptops come with the option to lower brightness. Some even come with ways to modify CPU and cooling performance.\n\n, All these add load to the CPU and cut down battery life. Shut down everything that isn't crucial when you're on battery.\n\n, USB devices & WiFi drain down your laptop battery. Remove or shut them down when not in use.\n\n,, This will allow you to process more with the memory your laptop has, rather than relying on virtual memory. Virtual memory results in hard drive use, and is much less power efficient.\n\n, Clean out your air vents with a cloth or keyboard cleaner.\n\n, Do one thing at a time when you're on battery, rather than working on a spreadsheet, letting your email client run in the background, and listening to music at the same time, which puts unnecessary overhead on your computer's CPU\n\n,, Laptops are getting more and more efficient in nature to the point where some manufacturers are talking about batteries lasting all day long. Picking up a newer more efficient laptop to replace an aging one is usually a quick fix.\n\n, Exceptions to the rule are Li-Ion batteries (which most laptops have) which do not suffer from the memory effect.\n\n, Microsoft Word and Excel autosave functions are great, but because they keep saving at regular intervals, which work your hard drive harder than it may have to. If you plan to do this, you may want to turn it back on as the battery runs low.

{"text":" The easiest way to do this is to type internet speed into Google and then click the RUN SPEED TEST button near the top of the search results. This will give you an estimate of your computer's current download speed.\n\nIf you see that your download speed is significantly faster than files are actually downloading, the problem most likely isn't with your Internet.\nIf your download speed is much slower than your Internet package and router allow for, you need to minimize the number of devices connected to the Internet.;\n, The more devices you have on your network, the slower your Internet will be. If you can disable consoles, phones, televisions, tablets, and alternate computers, your own computer's downloads will be faster., When you're downloading a big (or a small) file, it helps to turn off apps that are taking up your bandwidth.\n\n\nFor example, you'd close BitTorrent if it was running in the background while you attempted to download a Windows update.\n\n, Netflix, Hulu, and even YouTube can be a serious drain on your download speed. Even if it's only by a marginal amount, disabling these services will boost your download speeds.\n\nYou should also close any non-essential browser windows or tabs.\n\n, If your computer isn't using an Ethernet connection, connect it to your router with an Ethernet cable and see if your downloads increase in speed.\n\nIf your downloads do increase in speed, your wireless connection to the router is poor. Try staying closer to the router or purchasing a stronger router.\nIf the download speed doesn't increase, the problem is either with the router or your computer.\nYou can reset your router's cache by unplugging both the router and the modem, waiting for a minute or so, and then plugging everything back in.\n\n, As noble as it may be to give back to your favorite torrenting community by uploading, doing so while downloading will all but kill your download speeds. Wait to seed until all of your downloads have completed and you're no longer using the Internet (e.g., when you're at work or asleep)., This action disguises what you're downloading so that your ISP doesn't selectively throttle it. (ISPs will throttle if they know a BitTorrent client is doing a lot of downloading.) To do this:\n\n\nClick Options in the BitTorrent or uTorrent window.\nClick Preferences.\nClick BitTorrent.\nClick the \"Outgoing\" drop-down box.\nSelect Forced.\nClick Apply, then click OK.\n\n, If your router is more than a couple of years old, it will invariably begin to slow down, and it won't handle downloads as well as a newer one.\n\nWhen purchasing a new router, make sure you look at models that support the same download speed as your Internet package (or, ideally, higher download speeds).\n\n, Some Internet connections simply aren't able to handle hefty downloads, such as console or computer game installations. Many ISPs have a \"Gamer\" package that prioritizes download speed, though you'll likely have to pay significantly more for this package than you would for a standard Internet package., If you've tried everything else and you can't get your download speeds to increase, you'll need to call your ISP and tell them about the problems you're experiencing.\n\nYou may even need to switch your ISP if you live in a remote-enough area.\n\n, Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen, or press \u229e Win., It's in the bottom-left side of the Start window., It's near the top of the Settings page., This option is beneath the \"Change your network settings\" heading on the Status tab., It will be on the Connections page.

{"text":" Make sure you're not putting yourself in harm's way by administering CPR to someone unconscious. Is there a fire? Is the person lying on a roadway? Do whatever is necessary to move yourself and the other person to safety.\n\n\nIf there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see whether there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire, if possible.\nHowever, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or coat underneath their back and dragging it.;\n, Gently tap his or her shoulder and ask \"Are you OK?\" in a loud, clear voice. If he or she responds agreement \"Yeah\" or such, CPR is not required. Instead, undertake basic first aid and take measures to prevent or treat shock, and assess whether you need to contact emergency services.\n\n\nIf the victim does not respond, continue with the following steps.\n\n, The more people available for this step, the better. However, it can be done alone. Send someone to call for emergency medical services (EMS).\n\n\nTo contact emergency services, call\n\u2022 911 in North America\n\u2022 000 in Australia\n\u2022 112 by cell phone in the EU (including the UK)\n\u2022 999 in the UK and Hong Kong.\n\u2022 102 in India\n\u20221122 in Pakistan\n\u2022 111 in New Zealand\n\u2022123 in Egypt\n\u2022120 in China\nGive the dispatcher your location, and notify him or her that you're going to perform CPR. If you're alone, put your phone on speaker mode so your hands are free to start compressions. If you have someone else with you, have him or her stay on the line while you do CPR on the victim.\n\n, Unless you're a trained medical professional, odds are you'll spend too much valuable time looking for a pulse when you should be doing compressions.\n\n, And, make sure that the airway is not blocked. If the mouth is closed, press with your thumb and forefinger on both cheeks at the back of the teeth to help open the mouth and then look inside. Remove any visible obstacle that is in your reach but never push your fingers too far inside. Put your ear close to the victim's nose and mouth, and listen for slight breathing. Watch for rising and falling of the chest.If the victim is coughing or breathing normally, do not perform CPR.\n\n, Make sure he or she is lying as flat as possible - this is to prevent injury while you're doing chest compressions.Tilt their head back by using your palm against their forehead and a push against their chin.\n\n,,, Don't flex the arms to push, but nearly lock your elbows, and use your upper body strength to push.\n\n, Press down with both hands directly over the breastbone to perform a compression, which helps the heart beat. Chest compressions are more critical for correcting abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, heart rapidly quivering instead of beating).\n\n\nYou should press down by about 2 inches (5 cm).\nDo the compressions in a relatively fast rhythm. Some agencies recommend doing compressions to the beat of the chorus of \"Stayin' Alive,\" a 1970s disco hit, or at roughly 100 beats per minute.\n\n,, Place your hand on the victim's forehead and two fingers on their chin and tilt the head back to open the airway.\n\n\nIf you suspect a neck injury, pull the jaw forward rather than lifting the chin. If jaw thrust fails to open the airway, do a careful head tilt and chin lift.\nIf there are no signs of life, place a breathing barrier (if available) over the victim's mouth.\n\n, The American Heart Association no longer considers rescue breaths necessary for CPR, as the chest compressions are more important. If you are trained in CPR and totally confident, give two rescue breaths after your 30 chest compressions. If you've never done CPR before, or you're trained but rusty, stick with only chest compressions.Keeping the airway open, take the fingers that were on the forehead and pinch the victim's nose closed. Make a seal with your mouth over the victim's mouth and breathe out for about one second. Make sure you breathe slowly, as this will make sure the air goes in the lungs and not the stomach.\nIf the breath goes in, you should see the chest slightly rise and also feel it go in. Give a second rescue breath.\nIf the breath does not go in, re-position the head and try again. If it does not go in again, the victim may be choking. Do abdominal thrusts (the Heimlich maneuver) to remove the obstruction.\n\n, If you're also doing rescue breaths, keep doing a cycle of 30 chest compressions, and then 2 rescue breaths; repeat the 30 compressions and 2 more breaths.\n\n\nYou should do CPR for 2 minutes (5 cycles of compressions to breaths) before spend time checking for signs of life.\n\n,, If an AED is available in the immediate area, use it as soon as possible to jump-start the victim's heart. Make sure there are no puddles or standing water in the immediate area.\n\n, It should have voice prompts that tell you what to do.\n\n, Remove any metal necklaces or underwire bras. Check for any body piercings, or evidence that the victim has a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (should be indicated by a medical bracelet) to avoid shocking too close to those spots ().\n\n\nMake sure the chest is absolutely dry and the victim is not in a puddle. Note that, if the person has a lot of chest hair, you may need to shave it, if possible. Some AED kits come with razors for this purpose.\n\n, Follow the instructions on the AED for placement. Move the pads at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from any metal piercings or implanted devices.\n\n\nMake sure no one is touching the person, when you apply the shock.\n\n, If a shock is needed for the patient, the machine will notify you. If you do shock the victim, make sure no one is touching him or her.\n\n, Stick on adhesive electrode pads are intended to be left in place.\n\n,, Then position the free hand onto the opposite shoulder, and roll the victim onto the side with the straight leg. The raised knee\/bent leg is on top and helps stop the body from rolling over onto the abdomen. The arm with the hand tucked under the edge of the hip is kept from sticking out in the way when rolling the patient onto that side.\n\n, This position keeps saliva (spit) from accumulating in the back of the mouth or throat, and helps the tongue to hang to the side without it falling\/flopping into the back of the mouth and obstructing the airway.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":556}
{"text":" Place it on a table or counter so the refrigerator is completely emptied out. You will want to have empty space so that you can easily assess what items to sort through.\n\n\nAlthough most food will be fine when left out for a short period of time, make sure that such food is not left out more than an hour or so. Food can reach \"the danger zone\" in a relatively short period of time.\nHaving a cooler can make the process a bit safer for food safety, especially during hot summer months.\nIf you are cleaning out the refrigerator in cold weather, you may be able to put the items outside while you sort at your leisure.;\n, If possible, bag securely to prevent leakage or mold distribution. The yearly or quarterly refrigerator clean often alerts us to items we've completely forgotten about.\n\n\nCheck expiration and \"use by\" dates. These are indicators that a given item should be cleaned out.\nThrow away items that you are unlikely to use. If no one in the house likes olives, get rid of the jar that has been in the refrigerator since the martini party.\nEmpty the bin afterwards to make sure your house doesn't smell of all the food you throw out!\n\n, In order to get the job done quicker, you'll probably want to remove shelving and the like and place it near the kitchen sink, where it will be much easier to clean.\n\n\nFor a quick clean, you do not necessarily have to take out all shelving. But doing so assures a more in-depth clean.\nUsually shelving comes out in a similar fashion to oven racks, or drawers in a bureau.\n\n, Dish soap will be fine. Most of what you took out of your fridge either won't fit or shouldn't be placed in a dishwasher. Instead, lather up some suds, get a nice brush or sponge to scrub with, and start going at the removable items from your fridge.\n\n\nNever wash a cold glass shelf with hot water. The sudden temperature change could shatter the glass. Instead, use cold water or remove the shelf and let it come up to room temperature before washing it.\nFor heavy-duty spills and\/or stains, don't be afraid to use the power of hot water and ammonia. Dilute a little bit of ammonia in hot water (1:5 ratio should be plenty) and let the item(s) soak before scrubbing.\nBe sure to let the shelving, and drawers dry out completely on a drying rack before inserting back into the refrigerator.\n\n, Attack any big or stubborn stains and hit all the remaining surfaces with a clean cloth or sponge.\n\n\nYou probably don't want to use a strongly scented soap or cleaner on the inside of the fridge, as food may absorb the smell. Instead, use one of the following natural cleaning solutions:\n\n2 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 quart hot water1 part apple cider vinegar to 3 parts hot water\n\n\nFor really stubborn stains or buildups, try using a dab of white toothpaste. It serves as an abrasive cleanser and it smells mighty fine to boot., If your refrigerator door has shelving space and is regularly used, make sure to hit that area too, either with a chemical cleaner or a gentler one (explanation above).\n\n, With a clean cloth, wipe off any excess water from your removable shelving and place it back in the refrigerator.\n\n, Don\u2019t saturate the seal with undiluted bleach as this may ruin the integrity of the gasket. Pat the gasket dry and then apply lemon oil, mineral oil, or body lotion on the gasket to keep the rubber supple.\n\n, Wipe off any jars, bottles, or tupperware and place them back into the refrigerator. Double-check the expiration dates on any perishable items before placing them back.\n\n,\n\n\nPull the refrigerator forward to expose all sides. To avoid scratching your wood floor or tearing linoleum, use an appliance glide when moving your refrigerator.\nClean the all exterior surfaces using a towel and all-purpose cleaner.\nIf your model has the coils mounted on the back of the unit, skip wiping the back until Part 3.\n\n, For information on your refrigerator's condenser coil location, reference your Use and Care manual. Depending on your refrigerator model, the condenser coils can be located in several places:\n\n\nAlong the back of the unit, or\nMounted under the unit and accessed via the rear panel, or\nIn the front of the unit and accessed via the toe grill.\n\n, It is important to unplug the refrigerator to prevent electric shock. If your unit is built-in or difficult to pull forward, turn off\u00a0power via your home\u2019s breaker box.\n\n, Be extremely careful not to puncture the coils.\n\n\nAfter cleaning the coils with a coil brush, use a vacuum with attached brush to clean up the excess dust and dirt on and around the coils. Do not use a cleaning solution on the coils\n\n, The fan circulates are across the coils, which aids in releasing excess heat. If the fan blade is obstructed in anyway, the coils will have a hard time releasing heat.\n\n,,,, Every three months, remove most or all of your food from the fridge and wipe all the surfaces with a baking soda or vinegar solution. Regular maintenance will save you time and energy in the future.\n\n\nThis almost goes without saying, but if you notice a spill or stain in the fridge, try to clean it up quickly and remove the source of the stain. Spills or stains that aren't cleaned quickly can set and become harder to remove in the future.\n\n, Before food goes bad, and starts coating the inside of your fridge with regular blasts of bad odors, it's time to act. Here's what you can equip your fridge with to combat these smells:\n\n\nA clean sock filled with activated charcoal \u2014 from an aquarium store, not from your bbq briquettes. The charcoal absorbs bad odors for up to three months.\nAn opened box of baking soda. Baking soda is another excellent odor absorber.Most baking soda packages say you should change your baking soda out every 30 days, but you can probably get away with 60 to 90 days of use before exchanging.\nFreshly ground coffee, placed in a small dish at the back of the fridge, also works very well at absorbing odors.\nUnscented chlorophyll cat litter is yet another odor buster. 1\/2\" kitty litter in a shallow pan at the back of the refrigerator should eliminate most offending smells.\n\n, This may not be for everyone, but some people might enjoy the subtle hint of vanilla, for example, when they open their refrigerator. The operating word in this whole step is \"subtle.\" You probably don't want any fragrance to be overwhelming upon opening of the fridge. Like cologne or perfume, a nice \"afterthought\" is much more pleasant, especially coupled with food:\n\n\nSprinkle a little vanilla extract, tea tree oil, or essence of lavender, lemon, or even bergamot in a cotton ball and place the cotton ball in a small dish at the back of the fridge. Exchange every couple of weeks.\n\n, A crumpled paper bag works wonders at removing smells in the crisper.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":557}
{"text":" Conures are active birds that like to keep busy.Your conure will need a cage that gives him lots of space to move around and play with his toys.If you have a small conure, his cage should be at least 18 x 18 x 18 inches (46 x 46 x 46 centimeters).A larger conure would need a cage that is at least 36 x 36 x 36 inches (91 x 91 x 91 centimeters). The cage can be either horizontal or vertical.The cage bars should be horizontal so your conure can climb on them.The bars should be spaced no further than 3\/4 inches to one inch (two to 2.5 cm) apart.\nConsider purchasing a cage cover to give your conure a sense of security when he sleeps.Alternatively, you could use a blanket or large towel to cover his cage at night.;\n, Your conure\u2019s cage should be in a room that is not in the direct path of harmful kitchen fumes.Within the room, make sure not to place the cage in direct sunlight.Conures are most comfortable in rooms that are 70 to 80 \u00b0F (21 to 27 \u00b0C), which is the typical room temperature for most homes.\n\n\nThe room should also be free of drafts.Many types of fumes are toxic to conures, including perfumes, aerosols, and fumes from cleaning products and non-stick cookware.\n\n, Perches are an essential item in any bird\u2019s cage. For your conure, choose at least two perches that are 1\/2 to 5\/8 inches (about 1.5 centimeters) in diameter.\n\n\nPosition the perches such that your conure\u2019s tail feathers will not rub against the cage bars when she sits on the perches.Place one perch close to your conure's food and water dishes.Consider using perches that have various sizes, shapes, and textures. This will help keep your conure's feet healthy and strong.Many types of perches are available at your local pet store.\nPlace two to three food and water dishes in her cage. One dish would be for water and one or two would be for food.\nConures love to take baths. Place another water dish in your conure's cage,preferably one that is large enough for her to step in. Look for these dishes at your local pet store or housewares store.\nLine the bottom of your conure\u2019s cage with newspaper or paper liners., Conures can be messy, so you will need to maintain a regular cleaning schedule for your conure\u2019s cage. On a daily basis, you should clean his water and food dishes.Conures like to dip their food in their food bowls, so you may need to clean your conure\u2019s water dish several times a day.Replace the cage lining each day.Clean your conure\u2019s toys and perches on a daily basis. Dishwater detergent is sufficient for cleaning these accessories. Make sure to completely rinse off the soap before placing the cleaned items back in your conure's cage.Depending on how messy your conure is, you will need to disinfect his cage either weekly or monthly.Since bleach fumes can be toxic to your conure, you will need to keep him in a separate room when you disinfect his cage and allow it to dry.Speak with an avian veterinarian or avian expert about safe cleaning products to use in your conure\u2019s cage.\n\n, Conures like to be kept busy. Without things to do, your conure could become bored and resort to feather picking.Giving your conure a variety of toys will keep her happily entertained. Popular toy types for conures include foraging toys, wooden chew toys, and shredding toys.Foraging toys mimic your conure\u2019s natural food foraging behavior in the wild.Shredded toys can help your conure relieve stress and boredom.If you don\u2019t want to purchase a shredded toy, you can place some newspaper in the cage for him or her to shred.\nAvoid toys that have small parts. These parts could catch on your conure\u2019s beak or claws, possibly leading to damage or injury.Keep different types of toys at your conure\u2019s cage at all times to prevent boredom with any one toy.\nConsider installing a play stand in your conure\u2019s cage that can hold toys.All types of toys can be found at your local pet store.\n\n, Conures need lots of exercise to stay happy and healthy. Swings, and ladders would provide your conure with plenty of exercise during the day.For the ladders and swings, install them at heights inside the cage that will keep your conure\u2019s tail from rubbing up against the cage bars.\n\n, Mirrors can be a good choice of enrichment to keep your conure busy. However, introduce him to a mirror only after he has bonded with you\u2014otherwise he may bond with the mirror instead of you!Mirrors can also encourage mating behavior (e.g., regurgitating food, tail lifting).Mating behavior can be especially problematic in female birds, since they can lay eggs without a mate. If you have a female conure, mating behavior can lead to spontaneous egg laying that could result in physical stress and illness.Your conure could see the mirror as a \"love toy.\"Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure about placing shiny objects in your conure\u2019s cage.\n\n, Pelleted bird food is commercially available at your local pet store. Pellets should make up approximately 60 to 70% of your conure\u2019s diet and seeds no more than 10% and fruits and veggies for the rest. They can come in different colors, which adds a little variety to an otherwise uninteresting food.Pelleted bird food, along with seed mixes, provide a good, nutritious diet.\nSome commercial seed mixes have fillers or harmful additives.Ask an avian veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store if you are unsure about which pelleted food and seed mix would be best for your conure, or select a seed mix that is labeled as \"organic\" or \"all natural.\"\n\n, Variety is key to feeding your conure a nutritionally balanced diet. Fruits and vegetables are a great way to add this variety. Examples of fresh vegetables to feed your conure are collard greens, spinach, pumpkins, and zucchini.There are many types of fruit you can feed your conure, such as mangoes, blueberries, kiwi, and apples.Fruits and vegetables also add important vitamins and minerals to your conure\u2019s diet.Wash the fruits and vegetables thoroughly with water to remove pesticides.Consider purchasing organic produce but not \u00a0avocado because it is poisonous to your bird.Cut the produce into smaller pieces.\n\n, Nuts add healthy protein and fat to your conure\u2019s diet, and should be a mainstay in her daily eating regimen.Examples of nuts to feed your conure are hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, peanuts, and brazil nuts.The nuts should be low in salt.\nAlthough important, nuts should be fed only in small amounts because of their high fat content. Your conure could become obese if she eats a lot of nuts.If you feed your conure peanuts, they must be unshelled. Peanut shells contain a fungal toxin called aflatoxin that could make your conure very sick., In addition to nuts, grains and legumes are mainstays of a conure diet. There are many types of healthy grains you can feed your conure, such as cooked brown rice or barley, as well as cereal, pasta, and crackers.Conures cannot break down sugar very well, so avoid sugary cereals.\nExamples of legumes are lentils and different types of beans (e.g., green beans, black beans).Legumes and grains have vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are essential components of your conure\u2019s diet., You may need to supplement your conure\u2019s diet with certain nutrients, including calcium and vitamin K. Incorporate foods into his diet (dark leafy greens, soy oil, and fish meal) that are high in these nutrients.Adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin K are important to prevent a condition called Conure Bleeding Syndrome.Calcium perches are available that your conure can chew on to get extra calcium in his diet.Cuttlebone is another calcium source, but is not recommended for conures.Water-soluble vitamins can be added to your conure\u2019s water.\nSpeak with your veterinarian before supplementing your conure\u2019s diet.\n\n, Conures are not picky eaters.However, there are certain foods that she should not eat. For example, your conure should not eat avocados, cocoa, or onions.These foods contain toxins that could sicken your conure.\n\n\nHuman foods that are high in sugar, salt, or fat should also be avoided, since a conure\u2019s digestive system cannot break them down very well.Processed foods tend to be high in these ingredients.\n\n, Feed your conure once in the morning and once in the evening. At each feeding time, place a variety of fresh foods, cooked foods, and seeds in his food dishes. After about one hour, remove any remaining food.In the morning, give him some pellets after you have removed the other food. He can snack on the pellets throughout the day.Conures are prone to obesity. To prevent him from overeating at mealtime, feed him only as much as he can eat in one sitting.It will probably take some trial and error to determine how much to feed him at mealtime.\nSince conures are messy eaters and like to dip their food in their water, you may have to replace your conure\u2019s water dish at each meal time.\n\n, Since conures are very social and outgoing birds, interacting with your conure is important to his overall care. To have quality interactions with her, you will first need to gain her trust. One way to gain her trust is to talk to her in a smooth and calming voice.Talk to her throughout the day, especially when you are feeding her and cleaning her cage.\nThe more she hears your voice when you are near her, the more comfortable she will be with you.\nAnother way to gain her trust is to approach her cage slowly and calmly. When she sees that you are not a threat, she will be much more at ease when you are nearby.\n\n, In addition to trusting you, your conure will also need to be comfortable with your hand. Begin by gently placing your hand either on or near the outside of his cage.Talk to him while you hold your hand nearby to calm his anxiety.\n\n\nWhen your conure is comfortable with your hand outside his cage, slowly place your hand inside his cage.Hold some treats (e.g., millet spray, dark leafy greens) in your hand and keep your hand still while he approaches and explores your hand.\nIt may a few days or a few weeks before your conure is comfortable with your hand. Just be patient with him.\n\n, When your conure trusts you and is comfortable with you, you can have all types of fun with her. For example, you can teach her to step up. Using your index finger as a perch, gently press your finger against her lower chest (just above her feet) to encourage her to step up onto your finger.Give her a treat and verbal praise when she steps onto your finger.\nWhen she gets good at stepping onto your finger, you can take her out of his cage and practice stepping up in a different room, such as the bathroom.\n\n, Parrots are known for their ability to talk. However, conures are not as good as other parrot species when it comes to talking ability.Try as he might, your conure will probably be able to learn only about five or ten words.\n\n\nYour conure will need to focus all of his attention on you to learn how to talk. Turn off any other noises (television, radio, phone) that may distract him.Choose simple words and phrases, and associate them with a specific object or action.For example, you can say \"Are you hungry?\" when you feed him and \"Goodbye!\" when you leave the room.\nSpeak with enthusiasm to your conure. The more excited you sound, the more excited and motivated he will be to mimic your words.Your conure\u2019s voice will be high pitched., Another way to interact with her is to help her take her morning bath. Use a spray bottle to gently spritz her with a mist of water.If she will let you, gently wrap your conure in a towel after her bath and hold her close to you until she is dry.Conures are very cuddly, so your conure will probably enjoy being so close to you after a good bath.\nWhen she is dry, your conure will preen herself. To preen, she will use her beak to reach back to her oil gland (located at the base of her tail) and spread the oil over her plumage., Believe it or not, conures have rhythm and like to dance!When your conure is excited or is trying to copy your movements, he will sway back and forth. If you like to dance, turn on some music and dance in front of your conure. Watch in amusement as he sways from side to side to match your movement.\n\n, Playing with your conure is a great way to interact with her. A simple game is \"peek a boo.\" Simply wrap her in a towel and say \"peek a boo\" when you uncover her face.Do this any many times as you want\u2014chances are your conure will love to play this with you over and over.\n\n\nPlay fetch with your conure. Toss a soft stuffed toy towards your conure.Be aware that she might not be very good at catching what you toss, but she will have fun anyway. She may even toss the toy back to you.Mimic your conure\u2019s actions and vice versa. For example, when your conure stretches her wings, stretch your arms out in response.Move side to side, and see if your conure will do the same.\nMake a mess with your conure. Conures love to shred things. When you have your conure out of her cage, sit on the floor with her and make a mess by shredding some newspaper. Give her her own newspaper to shred., Conure owners like to teach this popular trick to their birds. With your conure perched on your finger outside of his cage, place him against your chest with his back facing away from you. Gently place your free hand on his back and begin to bend your body forward very slowly.\n\n\nKeep your hand on your conure\u2019s back as you bend forward. Lying back may feel a bit strange to your conure at first, so he will need your hand on his back to feel more secure with this movement.\nWhen he is comfortable lying back on your hand, you can play with him by tickling his tummy.You could also give him small toys that he can play with when lying on his back.When your conure can lie back, you can teach him more advanced tricks like doing back rolls., As important as it is to interact with your conure, you should not pay her attention when she screeches. Conures are prone to making very loud noises.As ear piercing as these screeches can be, do your best to ignore her when makes this noise.\n\n\nIf you go over to her cage when she screeches, she may learn that she can screech to get your attention. To her, your attention is a reward for her behavior.\nInteracting with your conure on a regular basis and giving him plenty of toys to play with may help to temper his screeches.\n\n, Molting happens to a bird when its feathers naturally shed and new ones replace the old ones. Molting is necessary to any bird's (including conures') growth., Molting begins when the conure is around 8 to 10 months of age and continues on every year. The season in which molting occurs depends on the species of the conure., The conure will be more annoyed and won't be too cooperative. The conure will feel itch due to the new feathers growing out. Water could be sprayed on the conure to relieve the itchiness.,, This could be done by gently brushing your hand on the conure's body to help the new feathers to come out. If you have a couple of conures who are molting at the same time, the conures can support each other by preening each other and rubbing their bodies against each other.Preen gently as new feathers could be painful to the conure when touched.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":558}
{"text":" If it's not on the Dock, you can find it in your Applications folder, or search for it in Spotlight.;\n, To make a movie with iMovie, you must first import the video from your camera to your computer. Most cameras make this a fairly painless process using either USB or Firewire cables directly from the camera, or flash memory cards such as Secure Digital (SD) or CompactFlash (CF) connected through a card reader. You can also import movies from the iPhone or the iPad through the normal 30-pin or Lightning connector.\n\n\nConnect the most appropriate cable to your camera. Using the cable that came with your camcorder, connect the small end to the camera, and the larger end to your computer.\nPower on your camera, and set it play out through the cable. This function will have different names depending on the brand and model of camera you are using. It might be PC\nSelect the image definition of your movie. If you are shooting HD video, select that, or select \"Large,\" or \"Full\" in the import window. If it doesn't open automatically, select \"Import from Camera\" from the File menu.\n\n, The Import window will show you all the clips available on your camera. (Every time you stop and start your camera, you're creating a new clip).You can choose to import all the available clips, or click to deselect the clips you don't want to import, then click \"Import Checked.\"\n\n\nIf you're using a tape-based camcorder, you can import everything, or use the on-screen camcorder controls to fast-forward or rewind to locate a particular piece of film you want to import, and use the Play and Stop controls to start and stop the import.\n\n, Make sure you choose a location with a lot of room: video files, especially HD files, can be quite large. You don't want to run out of room before you even get started!\n\n,\n\n\nThe first time you import video from your camera, there won\u2019t be any existing events in your Event Library.\nTo create a new event, type a name for it in the \u201cCreate new Event\u201d field.\nIf you\u2019re importing video that recorded on different days, you can have iMovie create a new Event for each of those days by selecting \u201cSplit days into new Events.\u201d\nTo append the new video to an existing event\u2014video that you imported into iMovie previously\u2014select \u201cAdd to Existing Event\u201d. Edit the new event\u2019s name from the pop-up menu.\n\n, Choose \"Stabilization\" from the \"After import analyze for\" menu. iMovie will analyze your footage, and smooth any shaky cam motion (such as you might remember from a film like \"The Blair Witch Project.\"\n\n\nThe other option in the Analyze menu is to search your footage for people. This will place markers in the footage when iMovie detects the presence of humans.\nBoth stabilization and searching for people can take a long time to complete.\n\n, If you are importing HD video, choose a size for the movie from the \"Optimize video\" popup menu. When all your settings are set, click the OK button and take a break. It will take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.\n\n, First, from the File menu, select \"New Project\u2026\" or press Command-N. This will create the basic project framework. With that created, you can add a theme to your movie. iMovie comes pre-loaded with a number of unique and interesting themes that help give your movie a unique, interesting look and feel. There is everything from a scrapbook theme to a Hollywood blockbuster movie. Preview the options, select the one you like\u2014or select \"No Theme\" if you want to roll your own, then click the Create button.\n\n, Before you add content, you have to give that content somewhere to go.\n\n\nNext to the Themes list, assign a name of your project in the \"Name:\" field.\nChoose an aspect ratio for your movie. The aspect ratio is a dimension describing the height and width ratios. For example, iPads and iPhones before the iPhone 5, standard TV screens, and older computer monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Newer televisions and monitors will use the widescreen 16:9 format.\nChoose a frame rate for your video. Use the same rate the video was shot using. Most video cameras in the U.S. use \"30 fps - NTSC,\" whereas European cameras generally use \"25 fps - PAL.\" If your camera supports 24 fps, and you elected to shoot with that format, then choose that option.\n\n, When you join two clips together, you have several ways of moving between them. You can set up iMovie to always chose a particular transition, though you may switch any preset transition at any time.\n\n\nThe Project Themes automatically add cross dissolves (gradual crossfades between one clip and the next) and other transitions, but allow you to deselect that option if desired.\n\n, When you're done setting up your project, click the \"Create\" button, and the new blank project will open in the Project Browser window.\n\n, Once you've defined a new project, you can add video clips into the movie. All the clips you imported will be listed in the Event Library section below your Project Library and Preview screen.\n\n\nIf you closed iMovie before beginning this section, launch iMovie, then double click on the Project Name of the project you created earlier.\nIf you want to change projects, click on the Project Library button, and choose one from the list.\n\n, In the Event library, all events available will be listed. Select the event you wish to work with by clicking once on it.\n\n\nIf you don't see the event list, look in the lower left hand corner of the iMovie window.\n\n, Select clip or a range of video frames from the film strips in the Event Library.\n\n\nTo select an entire clip, hold down the Shift key, then click once on the clip once, so that it\u2019s outlined in yellow.\nTo select a specific range or section of a clip, click and hold on a section of the clip, then drag across the clip while holding down the button on your mouse or trackpad. Selected frames are outlined in yellow.\nDrag your video selection to the Project browser in the top left of the screen. A vertical green line, along with a green Add (+) symbol, appears anywhere you can place the clip.\n\n, Drag in each clip, or section of a clip, into the Project browser in any order you prefer. You can place the clips sequentially, or place a clip between two others.\n\n, You can add more than movies to iMovie, and add a documentary feel to your film by adding still photographs. Whether scanned or shot digitally, the process is the same.\n\n, Click on the camera icon located on the lower right side of the screen, above the video clips. The Photo Browser will slide in from the right, and lets you choose all the files in your iPhoto library.\n\n\nIf you haven't imported you're stills into iPhoto, you can do so, then click on the Last Import button to see only those images. Otherwise, you can simply drag them in from wherever they are located on your hard drive\u2014though keeping all your images together in one folder is best.\n\n, If you drag it before or after a clip, there will be a green vertical line, indicating that it's safe to place the image in that spot.\n\n\nIf the line is red, you are placing the image in the middle of an existing clip, and you'll be asked if you wish to replace the existing clip, insert the clip, or cancel the operation.\n\n, You can intersperse still images in between a clip of an action scene\u2014for example, grabbing a clip of a snowboarder catching air, extracting a single frame in mid-jump, and then placing that in the video where it was cut from.\n\n\nYou can set the duration of the still, so the end result will be something like: jump begins, boarder starts to lose balance, freeze! The clip lingers on the boarder, giving your audience a moment to realize what's about to happen, then unfreeze! The jump completes, and the boarder does a yard sale\u2014exactly as expected. You could top it off with another still of the the boarder smiling with a face full of snow!\n\n, Once you have everything in place, you can add elements to your film to really make it look special. You can use (or change) themes, add transitions, music, and titles.\n\n, If you didn't choose a theme at the beginning, you can add one now. From the File menu, choose \"Project Theme\u2026\" or press Shift-Command-J.\n\n, Fine one of the thumbnails that you like (you can preview them by clicking them), and choose whether or not to include the automatic transitions.\n\n\nWhen you select a theme, you will see a 30-second sample video so you know what to expect.\nIf you're new to iMovie, use the automatic transitions and titles option. It will help you get a feel for how they work, and you can always change or edit them later.\nMake your choice by selecting or un-selecting the \"Automatically add transitions and titles\" checkbox.\n\n,, You can add transitions between clips by opening the Transitions browser on the iMovie toolbar.\n\n\nSelect the desired transition, then drag it between two clips. iMovie will automatically manage the transition. You can easily change transitions by double clicking on the transition icon in your movie, and selecting a new one from the popup menu.\n\n, A movie without music is what they used to call a \"slide show.\" Nobody liked to sit through those back when that was the only way to see those vacation pics, let alone now, when it's so easy to do.\n\n, This will switch the browser from your photo library to your iTunes library, as well as your Garage Band folder and Sound Effects folders.\n\n\nLook through your list of music until you find the song you want to add. When you find an appropriate selection, click on the song, and drag it to the end of the video clips in the Project browser. Don't drag it over a particular clip. When you see the green vertical line, release the mouse, and your clip will be placed into the movie.\nThe background behind the movie clips will be shaded green for the duration of the music clip, beginning at the first clip in your movie, and ending at the end of the music. Note that this may end before your video track, or go beyond your video track. If the music is too short, you can always add another clip at the end of the project. If it's too long, you can fade it out at the end.\n\n, In the Music and Sound Effects browser, there is a sound effects folder. Click on that, and select a sound effect for a spot in the movie. For example, if you have a clip of people walking, you can add footsteps to the movie, even if you have background music! Drag the sound effect to the first frame you want it to appear. If it's too short, add another sound effect, or if too long, trim and fade out as desired. (See following).\n\n, If the music or effects are too long, too loud, or you want to add some studio effects, click the Action pop-up menu (the gear icon at the top left of the green audio clip), and then click on Audio Adjustments. Play your movie. As long as the Inspector window is open, your movie will loop through the selected sound\u2014making it easy to adjust the settings for short snippets of audio like sound effects, so they're not too loud, or too soft.\n\n\nIn the resulting Inspector window, you can adjust the volume, fade in or fade out, EQ, and other adjustments as desired.\nVolume: adjusts the volume of the selected audio track.\nDucking: drops the volume of all other audio tracks. This is useful if you have a clip of somebody talking over background music. Ducking makes the volume of the background music lower, so the voice can be heard more clearly.\nFade In\/Fade Out: lets you ease in or out of a sound by a specified duration. Click on which one you want to alter, then drag the sliders to the set the length of time for each.\nReduce Background Noise: reduces \"noisy\" sounds, useful for traffic, crowds, etc., to make voices more intelligible. Too much can eliminate background sounds completely.\nEQ: this is just like the EQ on your stereo, and adjusts the tonal qualities of the sound.\nNormalize Clip Volume: this will make the loudest sound in the clip as loud as possible without distortion, making every other sound in the clip louder as well (unless the loudest sound is already at maximum, in which case this will have no noticeable impact on the sound. You can remove added normalization by clicking the \"Remove Normalization\" button below it.\n\n, At the top of the audio Inspector window, click the Clip button, and then the \"Audio Effect:\" popup menu.\n\n\nAudition the reverbs, echoes, and pitch effects by rolling over them (not clicking), and if any are desirable, click on them.\nWhen you're satisfied with all adjustments, click Done, and your choices will be saved.\n\n, You can add text anywhere within the movie, and at the beginning or end as credits.\n\n, A series of different text treatments appear. To add those to your movie, click and drag one to the relevant clip.\n\n, Replace the temporary text with words of your own, as necessary. To alter the font, right click on the text and select \"Show Fonts\" from the menu. Choose from the available list or click \"System Font Panel\" at the bottom left of the window, and choose from your available fonts. There are 9 different color options in the basic panel, but you can set any desired color in the System font panel.\n\n, Select the title clip in the Project browser, and adjust the length as desired by clicking on the side, and dragging in necessary direction.\n\n\nTo view the Title inspector, double click on the title clip.\n\n, If you didn't use a stock theme, you can add credits at the end by dragging the Scrolling Credits title to the end of the movie, and filling in the correct credits.\n\n, iTunes will build your project, with all transitions, effects, titles, and settings baked in. Depending on the length and complexity of your movie, this could take an hour or two, so be ready to take a break!\n\n\nWhen you're done, your movie will be ready to play, burn to DVD, or upload to YouTube. Congratulations!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":559}
{"text":" \u00a0If in doubt, install a clean copy of the OS on a new partition of your computer or on a bootable USB.\u00a0This isn't a mandatory step, but if you want to be truly secure it's a good idea.\n, As of July 2016, the most popular, open source paper wallet creation site is\u00a0bitaddress.org and these instructions will use that site.\u00a0Verify that you are on the correct bitaddress.org site by checking the https certificates by clicking to the left of your browser URL as seen in the photo.\n\n\nAdvanced users can be even more secure by downloading a copy of BitAddress from GitHub, verifying the software using the PGP signature, and moving it to a fully offline computer via USB key. You can then run the BitAddress code offline by clicking the HTML file.\n\n, You can do this by\u00a0turning off your wifi router and or unplugging your ethernet cable. Killing the web connection reduces odds that your private keys will not be leaked\u00a0over the internet without you knowing it. Bitadress.org was designed to run just fine without an internet connection., \u00a0This random movement generates a random seed that BitAddress will use to generate your wallet.,\u00a0Congrats, you just created a basic, low\u00a0security paper wallet!\n\nOn the left is a your Bitcoin address. In the example in the photo the address is \"15TfQt6RyNrqjJknd3b3CRkbwfXJ3i3BNC\".\u00a0 Think\u00a0of this as your email address. \u00a0It's OK to share it in public so people (or yourself) can send Bitcoin to the address.\nOn the right is your private key. In this example it's \"L4vfUiBm9XGeaXk8HWPkQfiTogQoZC6kzNnyPnqGEoBQaRXoAYkT\" Think of this as the password to your email address. \u00a0Never, ever share your private key with anyone or store it on a computer or the web. \u00a0Anyone who can access your private key can immediately and irretrievably empty your wallet.\nIf you are storing a small amount of Bitcoin and are OK with low security you can print out this wallet and stop now. \u00a0If you need\u00a0higher security continue following the steps in Part 2 of this article.\n\n, Treat it like gold or jewelry. \u00a0If someone finds it and takes it, they can easily empty your wallet. Store a backup copy of the wallet in another secure location.,\n\nIt's also possible to do this with the other options such as Bulk Wallet, but for the sake of simplicity we'll use the Paper\u00a0Wallet example.\n\n, Create\u00a0a long passphrase that you do not use anywhere else. Store\u00a0that passphrase separately from your bitcoin wallet., Congrats you have now created 3 high security paper wallets with encrypted private keys!\n\nUnlike in the example\u00a0Part 1,\u00a0the private key in this wallet is not stored in plain text. You will need to use your passphrase to\u00a0open the wallet. \u00a0This additional layer of security makes your wallet much more secure.\n\n, \u00a0By not using the network to print, you avoid the albeit low risk that your network is compromised and might read your private keys.\n\nPrint multiple copies of your paper wallet. This is a beauty of BIP38 paper wallets, you can have multiple backups, one in a bank safe deposit box, one in a home safe, one with your law firm, or whatever -- when BIP 38 protected all you have to be is trusting enough that the bank or whoever has it won't do a brute force attack.\n\n, \u00a0Close the private window on your browser and verify that no copies were stored in the cache. Close your browser. Reboot your computer. \u00a0Only then can you turn your internet back on., You now have encrypted paper wallets that have never accessed the internet. Read Part 3 below to learn how to safely use these paper wallets.,\u00a0\u00a0If you want you can send a very small amount of bitcoin to one wallet for testing you can do that, or you can practice with an empty wallet. \u00a0Either way works. The following steps will explain the procedure., This example will use Blockchain.info, which is open source, free and the most popular web\u00a0wallet as of June 2016. Go to Blockchain.info and follow their steps to create a wallet., \u00a0On the next screen click \"Import Address\"., Put the\u00a0private key QR code from your paper wallet in front of the webcam till you get the verification checkmark. \u00a0This can take a little futzing to make work. \u00a0It helps to have good lighting and to keep the QR code in focus., If all works out, you will be notified that you have successfully opened your private wallet. \u00a0Congrats! You've successfully decrypted your test wallet!\n\nNow that you have exposed the private key of this paper wallet to the internet, do not use it to store funds. Put this\u00a0wallet away and don't use it again.\nRepeat the above steps with other paper wallets if you think you need practice decrypting. \u00a0Make sure you've figured this step out before placing real funds in the wallet.\nNote that this process is the exact same process you will use to spend or move bitcoins from your paper wallet. The reason we are testing them now is to make sure you can successfully get your coins off your paper wallet when you are ready to do it.\nDo not proceed to later steps until you are confident you can decrypt wallets with your passphrase.\n\n, You do this by\u00a0using your public bitcoin address. \u00a0So say you having your friend send you bitcoin, just email or text her your bitcoin address. \u00a0Or if you bought coins on a bitcoin exchange like Kraken, Circle or Coinbase, log in to your exchange account and send the bitcoin from there to your bitcoin address.\n\nDo not reuse any of the wallets your opened during testing. Use a brand new one.\n\n, You can do this using any of the blockchain watching services. \u00a0Blockchain.info is helpful here. \u00a0Just go to the Blockchain.info homepage and enter your bitcoin address (but not your private key) into the search field. \u00a0You should see exactly how much bitcoin your wallet holds., Your coins are now\u00a0safely locked into your paper wallet. \u00a0As long as you\u00a0don't ever enter your private key to just \"check\" on your wallet, your funds will stay totally safe.\n\nAs long as only you have the ability to access both your private key and passphrase remain your funds will stay safe for years. This security costs you absolutely nothing. No bank fees ever.\n\n, Keep a backup in another location in case the first location is burned down or flooded. Store the BIP38 passphrase in a still separate location. It's okay to leave the passphrase in a computer or password manager program. Access to your BIP38 passphrase without your wallet's private keys can cause you no damage., If you want to spend or move your bitcoins it's important that you don't leave any funds in the paper wallet you spent with. If you do want to spend with your wallet, sweep all the funds into an online wallet like Blockchain.info and use all the funds there. Do not attempt to reuse a paper wallet.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":560}
{"text":" As soon as the noodles have come to a boil, turn off the heat and strain the noodles. Submerge shirataki in a bowl of cool water.\n\n\nThe shirataki shouldn\u2019t need much cooking. Rather, the par-boiling is designed to remove some of the odor from the noodles. Then the shirataki can absorb the full flavor of the sukiyaki sauce.\nIf using other kinds of noodles, look at instructions and par boil until they are only a couple minutes away from being al dente.;\n, Sukiyaki calls for very thin beef. Choose a marbled sirloin (or similar) cut for very good results.\n\n\nPlace the beef in the freezer for a couple of hours if you want to slice the beef yourself. When hard but not completely frozen through, beef is much easier to slice very thin., The stalks of the cabbage are a little more fibrous and take longer to cook. Therefore, cut right around the stalks of the cabbage until the stalks can be separated from the leaves. Cut the stalks into 1-inch (or smaller) pieces. Coarsely chop the leaves into larger pieces.\n\n, If you weren't able to get shiitake mushrooms, cut whatever mushrooms you have into bite-size pieces. If you were able to get the shiitake, here's how to traditionally prepare them:\n\n\nRemove the stem from the shiitake with a knife. Score a small star or cross into the cap of the mushroom with a knife. Imagine a straight line going through the middle of the cap. Take a knife and make a 30\u00b0 angled cut along this straight line, digging only a small amount of flesh from the mushroom, enough to show the whites. Angle the knife in the opposite direction and make another 30\u00b0 cut along the other side of the line. Repeat this process at the perpendicular to make a cross, and once more to make a star.\nFor enoki mushrooms, simply wash and cut off the root bulb to prepare.\n\n,, If substituting spinach or watercress, rinse thoroughly and separate the leaves from the stalks. Discard the stalks.\n\n, In a pot, bring 1\/2 cup sake, 1\/2 cup mirin, 1\/3 cup soy sauce, and 1\/4 cup sugar to a boil over medium heat. As soon as boil is reached, remove the sukiyaki sauce from the heat. The goal is to burn off the alcohol from the sake, not reduce the sauce.\n\n, The traditional way of cooking sukiyaki involves an earthenware or cast iron hot pot with a kerosene burner underneath. This way the chef can cook at the table where he intends to serve. Alternately, an electric pan can be put to great use to cook at the table as well.\n\n\nIf you have neither a hot pot or an electric pan to cook with, you can of course cook the sukiyaki on the burner away from the table. Just make sure to choose a large pot with an accompanying lid.\n\n, Beef suet is traditional, but lard or even vegetable oil can be used if the aim is a healthier meal.\n\n, You will keep the beef in the pot while the other ingredients cook, so be careful not to overcook it. Once the beef loses its pinkness, move it over to the side of the pan so it doesn't cook at quickly.\n\n\nSome cooks introduce a little bit of the sukiyaki sauce to the pan while they are cooking the beef.The sukiyaki sauce will bubble and reduce quickly because of the soy sauce.\nOther cooks prefer sweetening the beef a little with plain sugar while it\u2019s frying in the pan with the fat. There's no reason you can't do both.\n\n, Keep all ingredients separate; each separate ingredient should be bunched together on the pan.\n\n, Since shirataki contains a compound that makes beef tough, segregate it from the beef while all the ingredients are cooking.\n\n, Introduce the cabbage leaves, chrysanthemum, and onions into the remaining spots of the pot.\n\n,,, Traditionally, a dipping sauce of raw eggs is served alongside sukiyaki.The combination may not sound especially appetizing to westerners, but it is a surprisingly good combination, even if you aren\u2019t predisposed to liking it.\n\n\nIf you are worried about uncooked eggs carrying salmonella or don\u2019t like the flavor, omit them. For what it\u2019s worth, salmonella is very rare in raw eggs., Simply grab whatever looks appetizing out of the hot pot and dip it into the egg.\n\n\nIf you are not eating with family or close friends, use the thicker ends of your chopsticks to grab food out communal pots. This is considered polite.\n\n, If there are leftovers that didn\u2019t find into the first generation of the meal, cook them now in the remaining broth. Meat and leafy greens will take less time to cook than vegetables will.\n\n, In Japan, it is traditional to use the leftover broth as the broth for udon noodles. If you don't have enough broth but wish to make more, use the recipe for sukiyaki sauce above and combine it with the remaining sauce. Heat the broth back up to boiling, then reduce the heat to a simmer. If the broth tastes too overpowering, cut the broth with 1\/3 cup of water and taste again.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":561}

{"text":" You should have at least an undergraduate degree in order to become a private banker. It is helpful (but not necessary) for the degree to have a concentration in a finance area.Good choices include finance, business administration, or economics.Otherwise the degree can be in any area you excel in.\n\n\nMany private bankers supplement their initial education with a master\u2019s degree or even a Ph.D. in finance, business, or economics.\nAn undergraduate degree is not a legal requirement, but may be the requirement of the bank for banking officers generally.;\n, However, any sort of experience in banking, investment, or related areas can be beneficial. If you gain some experience, then you can prove your capability to private banking firms who might hire you in the future. In addition, you may have the chance to network with HNWIs while completing an internship.\n\n\nTalk to professors, a university career center, and anyone you know working in a financial field about the possibility of doing an internship. Many private banking firms and other financial companies already have established internship programs, so you should check with these directly as well.\n\n, These can raise your professional profile and the chances of landing your dream job.\n\n\nThe Wealth Management Institute (WMI) offers the 10-week Wealth Management Private Banking Programme and an associated certificate.This course is comprised of several sessions covering topics such as understanding the needs of business owners, private equity and hedge funds, estate planning, and asset allocation.\nThe Globecon Institute offers a nine-month course and certificate in \u201cPrivate Banking and Wealth Management\u201d as well as a three- to four-month course and certificate in \u201cOperations in Investment Banking and Securities Markets.\u201d\n\n, In the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) administer licenses that private bankers must have in order to collect commissions of the sale of financial products.The Series 6 license permits private bankers to advise clients on \u201cpackaged\u201d products such as mutual funds, annuities, and trusts. The licensed is awarded by passing a 135-minute exam on investing, regulations, and ethics. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member.\nThe Series 7 license allows private bankers to advise clients on individual securities such as stocks and bonds. The license is awarded by passing a 6-hour exam on securities trading. In order to apply for the license, you must be sponsored by a firm that is a FINRA member.\nThe NASAA administers the Series 63 license that every state requires private bankers to have in order to advise clients on investments. The license is awarded by passing a 75-minute exam. You must have the Series 63 license before you can apply for the Series 6 or Series 7 license.\nThe NASAA also administers the Series 65 license, which permits private bankers to advise clients for an hourly fee rather than a commission. This license is awarded by passing a 180-minute exam.\n\n, Get to know some of these individuals and their needs very well. If you do not already know potential clients, then you will need to seek some through networking. Much of the networking for private bankers might take place in social or informal settings.\n\n\nStart by working with any HNWIs that you know. Have lunch with them, try to get invited to events they might attend with other HNWIs, etc.\nWhen you meet HNWIs, make sure to get their contact information (including social media profiles), and share yours with them.\nOnce you form initial connections with HNWIs, begin asking them about meetings or informal events like a round of golf. Use these as an opportunity to get to know each other better.\nBe present at any events that HNWIs are likely to attend, such as fundraisers. These are opportunities to meet potential clients, but also to learn about what is important to them.\nBe firm about how you can help HNWIs with private banking services, but don\u2019t be pushy. Show genuine care for their work and interests.\n\n, You can work with these clients on your own, essentially setting up your own business. However, you may be more likely to attract and retain clients if you have the name recognition and security of an existing private banking firm, and so you may want to seek a job at one of these.\n\n\nIf you do have a list of potential or current clients, ask them about whether or not they would be willing to have you continue advising them if you moved to an existing private banking firm. If so, mention this to firms that interview you or that you approach about a job.\n\n, If you create a professional profile and make connections with others in private banking and other financial fields, then you have a better chance of being contacted about jobs that open up.\n\n\nKeep things professional. If you have social media accounts with public or semi-public profiles, make sure there is no content on them that you would not want clients to see.\nA general rule of thumb is if you would not share it with your grandmother, it should not appear on your social media profile.\nFocus on forging worthwhile, meaningful relationships rather than on increasing the sheer numbers of your followers, friends, or connections on social media. If you intend to use your social media accounts for professional purposes, then those relationships should be professional.\nIf you have social media accounts and intend to use them professionally, then it is important to regularly check and update them. If an account has not been updated in awhile, it will look odd, and if you don\u2019t check it regularly, then you might miss out on important communication or potential connections.\n\n, Make sure that yours emphasizes your skills and experience in private banking and\/or other financial fields, so that you increase your chances of landing an interview and your dream job.\n\n\nYou can send out resumes to apply for any posted openings in or related to the private banking field. However, you can also communicate with institutions that aren\u2019t currently hiring. Let them know you are working in or looking to enter the field. Give them a copy of your resume, and ask them to keep it on file in case they hire in the future. Showing initiative like this can be beneficial and make you a memorable job candidate.\n\n, One alternative is to get a start in personal banking, providing services (investing, retirement planning, etc.) to regular individuals. While you wait for a job in private banking to materialize, you will gain useful banking experience.\n\n\nPersonal banking is not a direct or obvious path to enter private banking. While serving in personal banking, you will still need to focus on networking with HNWIs who can potentially become your clients.\nIn addition, you will need to aggressively seek any opportunities to move out of personal banking into private banking. Keep sending out resumes and holding informational interviews, let supervisors at your current institution know that you are looking to enter private banking, and keep offering to work with any HNWIs that you know.\n\n, These are offered to select clients with larger portfolios or net worth (though not as high as HNWIs). Many of the same products and services offered to HNWIs are also offered to privilege banking customers, with the exception of hedge funds and private equity.\n\n\nPrivilege banking can offer more opportunities to meet or network with HNWIs, so actively seek out these individuals while working in the field.\nIn addition, continue to send out resumes and otherwise seek jobs in private banking. Stress how the skills you have developed in privilege banking will make you an effective private banker.\n\n, These help with scheduling, documents, and other demands of private banking. There may also be occasional opportunities to meet with HNW clients, although assistants do not normally advise them on financial matters.\n\n\nIf you are good at your job, your firm may eventually offer you some clients to service, or you may be able to take over the position when one of the firm\u2019s private bankers retires or leaves.\n\n, While this can provide you with knowledge and experience in the financial world, it will not provide the same opportunities to develop relationships with HNWIs. Thus, if you want to enter private banking from another area of finance, you will have to work hard to network with potential clients in addition to performing your regular job duties.\n\n, This means constantly reading financial news and reports, keeping up with the fine details of investments, staying abreast of financial laws and regulations, etc. If you do not keep up with this knowledge, then you risk providing your clients with bad advice and losing them; without your clients, you will not be able to work as a private banker.\n\n, To keep your clients happy (and gain new ones), you must be prepared to work very closely with them.\n\n\nMake sure that your clients can reach you at any time, and in many ways (phone, text, email, etc.).\nBe prepared to work long or odd hours in order to work around your clients\u2019 schedules.\nPrivate bankers will benefit from knowing about their clients\u2019 personal lives, family, businesses, etc. This knowledge can help you provide services and products that are tailored to a client\u2019s specific situation.\nBe able to engage with clients about the world in general\u2014current events, hobbies, politics, etc. HNW clients often want to see that their private bankers are well rounded, knowledgeable, and trustworthy, since that implies that they will provide excellent service.\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your clients ask you to do things that may not seem directly related to financial matters. This may mean they ask you to discuss a deal over a round of golf; it might also mean that they ask you to pick up their pet from doggy daycare so that they will have time for a meeting. Remember that your clients are your number one priority, and be flexible in meeting their requests.\n\n, Private bankers have to offer their clients excellent discretionary portfolio management.This service is \u201cdiscretionary\u201d in the sense that it is up to the portfolio manager (the private banker) to determine how to best maintain and grow a client\u2019s assets. This involves:\n\n\nUnderstanding the whole range of investment products: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), etc.\nHaving an in-depth knowledge of domestic and global markets, business trends, and investment strategies.\nMaking superior buy and sell decisions of investment products, based on the private banker\u2019s analysis of markets and trends.Determining how to allocate a client\u2019s assets among different investment products in order to ensure that the client\u2019s investment or personal goals are met.\nWorking with clients to explain the risks of any investment, and how to recover from any losses.\n\n, Each HNWI has different goals and needs, and your account management strategy will need to take these into account.\n\n\nUnderstand the different components of an individual\u2019s wealth and estate, which may include retirement accounts, insurance packages, annuities, real estate, personal assets (such as homes, vehicles, art or other collections), etc.\nAdvise your clients with both short-term and long-term goals in mind.Clients are interested in finding ways to make their wealth grow (short-term goals), but also think about how to maintain it for retirement, to pass on to descendants, etc. (long-term goals).\nDevelop a flexible strategy for managing your clients\u2019 wealth, since their needs and goals will change over time.For instance, you might advise a client to invest more aggressively when they are younger, in order to take advantage of opportunities for growth; as the client ages, however, you might advise them to stabilize their investments in order to protect them.\n\n, Laws, regulations, and strategies regarding estates and trusts can be complex and very particular, and so a private banker will have to work hard to advise clients well in these areas.\n\n\nPrivate bankers may advise clients on financial aspects of wills and choosing an executor.Since different assets are subject to different regulations and strategies, private bankers assist clients in planning for each asset class. For instance, you may help a client decide to leave real estate as an estate for heirs, while utilizing other investments as a philanthropic gift.\nMany HNWIs plan to create trusts for their dependents, and a private banker will assist in the creation and management of these.Charitable gifts are another common part of estate planning, and private bankers are called upon to help clients select and structure these.Estate and gift taxes can be substantial, and so a major part of a private banker\u2019s job can be helping clients plan to minimize these costs.Estate and trust plans will have to be reviewed and updated regularly, since clients\u2019 needs and circumstances change over time.\n\n, A key performance indicator (KPI) of private bankers is the amount of AUM they have.This refers to the amount of clients\u2019 money and investments that you manage. It is directly related to the fees that you or your firm charges your clients, and thus to your commission and salary. To succeed as a private banker, you will need to keep your AUM high and growing by providing services and products to established and new clients.\n\n\nThe salaries of private bankers working with established firms can vary widely, with estimates ranging from $30,000 to well over $100,000. Much of a private banker\u2019s salary is determined by the value of AUM.\nIn order to succeed in the long run, private bankers must always be thinking about the needs of their current clients as well as attracting new ones.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":564}

{"text":"\n\n\nIf someone says you are a racist person, this suggests a bigger problem. Maybe you've done multiple things that came off as racist. Or maybe they're just having a really awful day.;\n, When someone says they think you're a racist, take them seriously. Make time to listen to their concerns.\n\n\nLet the other party talk first before you respond; do not interrupt the other speaker. Then, in a calm and measured way, say, \u201cWow, I am very concerned that you consider me a racist. I\u2019m interested in discussing this matter further. Let\u2019s do so in the privacy of (my office, a cafe, a quiet room, etc.).\u201d\nIf there is a power imbalance, they may be afraid to speak to you in a completely private place. If so, try a semi-public place, like a restaurant, a park bench, etc.\n\n, Especially if they are a minority, they may be afraid of you, so do your best to put them at ease. This shows them that you are an understanding person who is willing to listen.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cI'm sorry if I've said or done anything hurtful. I'm really concerned about this. I want people of all races to feel safe and relaxed around me, so if I'm making people uncomfortable, I want to hear about it so I can learn from it.\u201d\n\n, Listen closely to what they have to say.It may be that you've made some mistakes, or that you said things that were interpreted differently than you intended.\n\n\nTell them, \u201cI want to know why you think this. What have I done that's racist?\u201d Listen attentively to their response.\n\n, Show sympathy for any racism they've faced, whether it was a misunderstanding or not. Make it clear that you care about their pain. (Some of it might be from other experiences that were not your fault.) This will help them feel calmer, and feel like they can trust you.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cThat must be difficult,\u201d \u201cI'm sorry to hear that you had to deal with that,\u201d and \u201cthat's too bad\u201d are examples of validating statements.\n\n, If you are white and the other person is a person of color, they probably know more about racism than you do. Listen carefully to their explanations; you may be surprised.\n\n\nThey might think you\u2019re racist because you support racist policies such as criminalization of certain drugs or exclusionary zoning policies. While such policies in theory are not aimed specifically at minorities, their implementation and impact are decidedly biased for or against a given race and therefore racist.Expressing support for politicians who pursue strengthening these policies might be perceived as racist.\nFinally, the most obvious and common definition of racism is one in which a person believes one race is superior or inferior to another. Using explicit racial slurs, supporting slavery\/segregation\/deportation, believing race drives behavior (e.g. \"Mexicans are rapists\"), are all examples of serious racism. If you said \u201cI believe it was a mistake to free the slaves,\u201d for instance, you are a racist.\nIf you don't understand, ask. \u201cI don't understand why that's racist. Would you please explain for me?\u201d\n\n, Mentions of your black friend, your Asian boyfriend, your time volunteering with Latinx children, etc. aren't going to fix things.Mentioning your ancestry doesn't help, either; just because you are of a minority race, doesn't mean you can't be racist to those of other minority races. Not all racists are hateful people who burn crosses, and you can be accidentally racist even while disliking racism in general.\n\n, Remind yourself that in the West, where governments and societies have long been controlled and guided by white men, everyone is racist to some degree or another. Recount to your accuser that many examples of unconscious racial bias exist in you, and that you will try to do better.Use the specific circumstances of the conversation or situation which led to you being accused of racism in order to clarify your position on the issue at hand.\n\n, It may have been that you said something that sounded racist, even if that's not how you meant it. If so, apologize for the misunderstanding and any discomfort on their part, and clarify what you truly meant.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cWhat I meant to say is that I disagree with Obama's policies, and dislike what he's done with the country. I am glad that America has had its first black president, and hope there will be many more. I'm sorry if I gave you the impression otherwise. That is definitely not what I meant.\u201d\nAcknowledge any surprise you feel. For example, \u201cOh, no, I'm so sorry! I'm surprised and horrified if my words came out that way! I think your fiancee is charming, including her dark skin! And I'm happy to have her joining the family, I promise, and I will call her and tell her that today.\u201d\n\n,\n\n\nThink about your culture\u2019s history in a framework which acknowledges the structural challenges to a fully egalitarian society. You have most likely absorbed some cultural biases without knowing.\nList some examples to demonstrate you understand the issue. Listening less intently to minorities; showing more caution around people of color; and being less likely to hire someone whose name is not traditional or sounds ethnic are just some of the many unconscious but racially biased behaviors everyone in a white society will likely exhibit., If you unintentionally hurt someone, own up to it and apologize. If they aren't ready to forgive you, ask if and how you can make it up to them. You want the person to walk away feeling satisfied and safe around you.\n\n\nIf someone was insulted, tell them a few things that you admire about them. Explain that you value them as a friend\/colleague\/mother-in-law\/etc., and assure them that the racist remark doesn't reflect your feelings about them.\nFor a friend or loved one, spend some extra time on the relationship. Take them somewhere fun, do something nice for them, or take extra quality time together.\nIf someone doesn't want to see you, give them space for as long as they need. This shows that you respect their wishes.\n\n, If they publicly called you names, ask them if they would rescind it.If you've been empathetic and willing to make amends, they will most likely agree. If they refuse, you can do little about it, but continue to explain yourself and let people know, if necessary, that you and the accuser have buried the hatchet, and you've made amends for any racist actions.\n\n\nAt the end of the conversation with the person who called you a racist, ask gently, \u201cAre you satisfied with how this turned out? Do you still consider me a racist or bad person? If not, would you please let others know? I want to move on from this, and would like to keep my reputation intact if possible.\u201d\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":566}
{"text":" This is useful because conditional formatting is best understood by testing it on data you already have. While you can apply conditional formatting to empty cells, it is easiest to see if the formatting works by using pre-existing data.;\n, Conditional formatting allows you to change font style, underline, and color. Using conditional formatting, you can also apply strike-through as well as borders and shading to the cells. However, you cannot change the font or the font size of the contents in the cell.\n\n, In Excel 2007 this can be found under \"Home\" > \"Styles\" > \"Conditional Formatting\".\n\n, For this example, two conditions are used to see how each one plays off the other. Excel allows up to three conditions per cell. If you need only one condition, skip the next step.\n\n,,, If it is based on other cells, change the first drop-down to \u201cFormula Is.\" For \u201cFormula Is\" directions, go to the next step. For \u201cCell Value Is\" directions, do the following:\n\n\nSelect what kind of argument works best using the second drop-down box. For conditions between a low setting and a high setting, select \u201cbetween\" or \u201cnot between.\" For conditions using a single value, use the other arguments. This example will use a single value using the \u201cgreater than\" argument.\nDetermine what value(s) should be applied to the argument. For this example, we are using the \u201cgreater than\" argument and cell B5 as the value. To select a cell, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n, After selecting \u201cFormula Is,\" all the drop-downs disappear and you are left with a text field. This means you can type in any formula you want using Excel\u2019s formulas. For the most part, you want to stick to simple formulas and avoid text or text strings. Keep in mind that the formula is based on the current cell. For an example, think like this: C5 (current cell) = B5>=B6. This means that C5 will change formatting when B5 is greater than or equal to B6. This example can actually be used in \u201cCell Value Is,\" but you get the idea. To select a cell in the worksheet, click the button in the text field. This will minimize the conditional formatting box.\n\n\nFor example: Imagine you have a spreadsheet with all the days of the current month listed down in Column A; you need to enter data in this worksheet everyday; and you would like the entire row associated with today's date to light up in some way. Try this: (1) Highlight your entire table of data, (2) Select conditional formatting as explained above, (3) Select \"Formula Is\" and (4) Enter something like =$A3=TODAY() where Column A contains your dates and Row 3 is your first row of data (after your headings). Note that you want the dollar sign in front of the A but not in front of the 3. (5) Select your formats. , You will notice that it automatically places dollar signs ($) before the row and column designations. This makes that cell reference non-transferable. This means if you were to apply the same conditional formatting to other cells through copy\/paste, they will all reference the original cell. To turn this off, simply click in the text field and delete the dollar signs. If you do not want to set a condition using a cell in your sheet, simply type the value into the text field. You can even enter text, depending on the arguments. For example, don\u2019t use \u201cgreater than\" as the argument and \u201cJohn Smith\" in the text field. You can\u2019t be greater than John Smith...well, you could, but - oh, never mind. In this example, the whole condition, if you were going to say it out loud, would read something like this: \u201cWhen this cell\u2019s value is greater than the value in cell B5, then...\"\n\n, Keep in mind that you want to offset the cell from the rest of the sheet, especially if you have lots of data. But you also want to make it look professional. For this example, we want the font to become bold and white and the shading to become red. To begin, click \u201cFormat...\"\n\n, Then click \u201cBorder\" and make any changes there. This example does not make border changes. Then click \u201cPatterns\" and make changes there. At whatever point you are finished making the formatting changes, click \"OK.\"\n\n, Make changes as needed until the formatting appears the way you would like.\n\n, You will notice in the example that the second condition also includes a small formula (=B5*.90). This takes the value of B5, multiplies it by 0.9 (aka 90 percent) and applies formatting if the value is less than that.\n\n, One of two things will happen:\n\n\nNo changes will appear. This means that the conditions are not met, so no formatting was applied.\nOne of the formats you selected appears because one of the conditions has been met.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":567}

This type of exercise also helps you work high speeds into other routines. To do a simple acceleration drill:\n\n\nJog for 10 yards.\nSprint for 10 yards.\nShift back to jogging for 10 more yards.\nShift back to sprinting for 10 more yards.\nBreakdown in 5 yards.\nWalk back to your starting point.\n\n, This horizontal tool requires you to alternate your feet across successive rungs as you run. To improve your speed, train with the ladder while using a stopwatch, and work on improving your best time.\n\n\nSpeed ladders are available at many athletic supply stores.\n\n, To accomplish this, do 30 minutes of interval training. Alternate light jogging (5-10 min) with short bursts of more powerful exercises, such as:\n\n\nSprints\nRunning stairs or hills\nLadder drills\nUsing a ball in combination with any of the above\n\n, To improve your reaction speed, practice while a coach or friend calls (or better, uses a visual signal) for you to change your exercise. Respond as quickly as possible. Try incorporating a combination of exercises like:\n\n\nChanging direction rapidly when running\nSprinting on command\nPlaying \u201cRed Light Green Light\u201d\n\n\n, To accelerate, you will have to extend and use your hip, knees, and ankles.When running or doing other exercises, focus on making long, even strides that stretch out. Increasing your stride length and muscle output in this way will boost your speed.\n\n, While training to increase your speed at moving across the field, do not neglect your control of the ball. Remember that soccer is primarily a sport where the player\u2019s lower body moves in contact with the ground and ball. To be not only fast, but fast and in control of the ball, you must work on your agility.\n\n\nDribble at every opportunity, using all parts of your foot (outside, inside, top, and bottom).Do speed dribbling exercises by kicking the ball slightly forward and running after it.\nPractice changing direction quickly while dribbling and doing speed dribbling exercises. You can also do this while attempting to evade another player in order to practice using quick dribbles as a way to beat opponents.\nDo lateral ball drop exercises. Have a coach or partner hold a ball at shoulder height, 5 meters away from you. When your coach\/partner drops the ball, attempt to reach and control the ball before it bounces a second time.\n\n, Always do stretches and short exercises to warm up before beginning a speed training session.This will prepare your mind and body. If you do not properly warm up, you risk injuring yourself.\n\n, Since it utilizes great power and force, you should do speed exercises while you are still fresh. Otherwise, you might not be able to reach and push your speed potential.\n\n, In addition to exercises that aim to improve your time, try doing plyometric (explosive) exercises and weight training, such as:\n\n\nJumps\nSquats\nBurpees\nBench press\nLifts\nLeg curls\n\n, It is very important that you take a day to rest between practice sessions. If you try to train for speed while you are sore or fatigued, you will be unsuccessful and risk injuring yourself.\n\n, Make sure that you have a fundamental knowledge of and good practice with soccer skills before attempting to increase your speed.

{"text":" Tobacco is an extremely hardy plant. It grows pretty much where any other agricultural crop will grow, although, as a rule of thumb, tobacco grows better in soils which drain well. The important thing to note is that tobacco will be extremely affected by the soil in which it is grown; lighter soils will generally produce lighter colored tobacco, while darker soils will generally produce darker colored tobacco.;\n, Tobacco requires a frost-free period of 3 to 4 months between transplant and harvest.For best results, tobacco should be ripened without heavy rainfall; excess water causes tobacco plants to become thin and flaky. The ideal temperature for growing tobacco is 68\u00b0 to 86\u00b0 F (20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 C).\n\n, Be sure you place your starting mix in a small flower pot, preferably with holes in the bottom. These seeds should be grown indoors for 4-6 weeks.Seed starting mix consists of compost and other nutrients which promote healthy seed growth. They are available at most gardening and home improvement stores.\nTobacco seeds are extremely small (not much larger than a pin prick), so be sure not to sow them too thickly. Allow adequate spacing between seeds to avoid overcrowding.\nBecause tobacco seeds are so small, it's not advisable to begin them outdoors. Also, their nutrient requirements are different from many other plants, so adding a bit of gravel or special fertilizer designed for tobacco is a good idea.\nTobacco seeds require warm temperatures ranging from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit to properly germinate. If you aren't growing in a greenhouse, make sure your indoor area meets these temperature requirements.\nDo not cover the seeds with soil since they need light for germination; covering can slow down and even prevent germination from taking place. Seeds should begin to germinate in 7-10 days., The soil should never be allowed to completely dry out.\n\n\nBe extra careful when watering because the force of the water can uproot the freshly emerging tobacco seedlings and cause them to die.If possible, water the seedlings from the bottom. If you used a flower pot with holes in the bottom, set the pot on top of a tray of water. Leave it there for a few seconds so that the water is absorbed by the soil. This will water the seedling without wetting the leaves.\n\n, Your seedlings should be large enough for transplantation if you watered and stored them correctly.\n\n\nTransplanting seedlings to a larger container will allow them to grow a strong and healthy root system.\nTo see if your seedlings are the right size, try grasping them. If you can easily pinch them between your thumb and index finger, they are ready for transplanting. If they are still too small, allow the germination process to continue until they have reached the right size.\nTransplanting tobacco plants bare-root (without soil) directly from the seedling pot to the garden is an easier method, as it only involves one transplantation. However, once planted, the bare-rooted plant can go into \"transplant shock\" where some or most of its largest leaves turn yellow and wilt. After a week, the tobacco plant will begin to flourish once more, but avoiding transplant shock altogether will save you a week of waiting as the potted plant will begin growing immediately once transplanted.\n\n, This should be sufficient food for the plants until they are ready to be transferred to your garden in approximately 3-4 weeks.\n\n\nIf your plant begins to look yellow or look stunted, another dose of fertilizer may be needed. Do so sparingly, however, since over-fertilization while in pots may burn the plants roots or lead to overgrown, spindly plants., Be sure the area you plant the tobacco is constantly exposed to sun, well-drained, and tilled.\n\n\nLack of sun will result in spindly plants, poor growth, and thin leaves. This may not be problematic if you intend on planting tobacco for cigar wrapper use, since growing tobacco under shade can create desirable leaf characteristics.Also test the pH levels of your garden. Tobacco plants need to be planted in moderately acidic soil, otherwise they won't flourish. The soil itself should have a pH of 5.8. Poor growth and some growth disorders may occur if the soil pH is 6.5 or higher.Avoid preparing your garden on soil that is infested with diseases and nematodes. Nematodes are parasitic worms which feed on tobacco and are extremely difficult to exterminate once infestation occurs.\n\n, Space the plants at least 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m) apart in a row, and space rows 3 1\/2 - 4 feet from each other.\n\n\nTobacco plants are \"heavy feeders,\" meaning they will deplete the nutrients in the soil in about 2 years. To counteract this, employ a 2 year rotation in your growing space by planting for 2 years in a different location and waiting 1 year before transferring it back to its original location.Rather than having an empty garden plot, you could rotate tobacco with plants that are not susceptible to common soil-borne pests, like corn or soybeans., Once they become better established, you can water less frequently to avoid over-watering.\n\n\nKeep the plants well watered without making the soil soggy. If your garden area may experience drought, consider installing an irrigation system. This will prevent the soil from becoming excessively dry, which can then hinder tobacco growth.If you expect a few days of light drizzles or rain, you can water even less frequently. The structure of the tobacco plant's leaves enables the plant to collect and funnel the water down to the base of the plant., Fertilizers used for tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes are also suitable.Over-fertilizing is a serious concern, as it can cause damaging salt accumulation. The application amount will depend largely on the grade of the fertilizer, the natural fertility of the soil, losses of nutrients due to leaching, and other subjective factors. Consult your fertilizer's directions for the most optimal usage.\nIt is recommended that you apply the fertilizer several times. Once the tobacco begins to flower, there should be no need to fertilize further.\n\n, Topping is the removal of the terminal (center) bud and allows the upper leaves to get larger and thicker than if they were untopped.The terminal bud is the most prominent and is typically located at the very top of the stem.The top can be removed by simply breaking or cutting it off, preferably before any flowers open.\nSoon after the top is removed, axillary buds or suckers will develop at each leaf. Remove these by hand as well, otherwise they will reduce the tobacco's yield and quality.\n\n, You can also pull up soil around the base of the plant to help strengthen it.Tobacco roots grow quickly and the root structure is quite large, with thousands of small hair-like feeder roots that grow close to the soil surface. Be careful when tilling or hoeing, as penetrating the soil too deep can damage the roots.\nAfter 3-4 weeks from planting, heavy tilling should be stopped and only light scrapings to control weeds should be done.\n\n, Common tobacco pests include budworms, hornworms, and pathogens.\n\n\nTobacco is subject to infestation by many different bugs and diseases. The rotation process should help reduce the likelihood of infestation, but it is no guarantee.\nIf you still find your tobacco to be infested, many gardening and home improvement stores sell tobacco-specific pesticides. Brand names include \"Nemacor,\" \"Prowl,\" and \"Admire.\" Keep in mind that some pesticides are specifically geared towards insect control on young plants, while others just kill fungus. Find a pesticide which is most suitable to your situation.\n\n, Alternatively, you can remove the leaves from the stalk in the field. Your plants should be ready for harvest about 3 months after planting.\n\n\nStalks should be cut about 3-4 weeks after topping. The lower leaves will be partially deteriorated at this time. If you remove the leaves in the field, there should be 4 or 5 harvests at intervals of 1-2 weeks, starting with the lower leaves. The first harvest should start soon after topping and when the leaves show a slight yellowing.\nFlowers will inhibit the growth of your leaves and will compete for sunlight; removing them is important for obtaining the broadest tobacco leaves possible.\nYou will need to keep the leaves intact because they will be hanged during the curing process. Curing is necessary because it prepares the leaves for consumption; the process produces various compounds in the leaf which give cured tobacco its hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor. Curing also contributes to the tobacco's \"smoothness\" when consumed.\n\n, The suggested temperature for curing ranges from 65 degrees to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, while the most optimal humidity ranges from 65-70 percent.Be sure to provide adequate space between the stalks to allow for satisfactory drying of the leaves.\nProper curing should take a few weeks in order to achieve good quality. Tobacco that cures too fast will be green and will likely not have good aroma or flavor. Leaves that cure too slow may develop mold or rot. Be sure to monitor your tobacco leaves closely for these signs and adjust your temperature\/humidity accordingly.\nIf curing leaves on the stalk, remove the leaves from the stalk once curing has completed.\nA building that can be opened and closed as needed to control the humidity and drying rate is ideal. Some producers of homegrown tobacco have built curing facilities and may offer them for sale.Air curing tobacco is primarily reserved for cigar use. Tobacco can also be cured using fire, the sun, or can be flue-cured. Fire-cured tobacco typically takes between 10-13 weeks and is used to make pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco. Sun-cured and flue-cured tobacco is used in cigarettes.\n\n, Commercial tobacco is typically aged for a year or more, but aging your own tobacco can take up to 5-6 years.\n\n\nAging will not occur if the temperature and moisture content is perfect. If the tobacco is too dry, it will not age; if it is too moist, it will rot. Unfortunately, the proper temperature and humidity vary widely and will require some experimentation on your part.\nMonitor your leaves closely during the aging process to ensure that they remain moist, yet rot free. Aging is not an exact science and will require impromptu adjustments when necessary.Aging your tobacco leaves is optional, but know that un-aged tobacco is often harsh and lacks good flavor.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":571}

They are popular options.\nPointers are good for finding birds in light cover and notifying owners., There are a variety of options, and you will want to keep in mind not only your target, but long hours of walking and carrying the gun.\n\n\nStick with a gun that weighs less than 8 pounds.\nA 12-gauge shotgun is always popular for hunting pheasants, although 16- or 20-gauge are possibilities.\nDouble-action shotguns are most common, although some hunters prefer semi-automatics.\nLead shot is often banned on public lands, so you\u2019ll need steel. Pheasant hunting requires a heavy shot, like size 4.\n\n, It's likely to be wet and cold, and you'll be doing a lot of walking on uneven terrain., It\u2019s usually in the late fall through the early winter, but the specific dates can change based on where you live.\n\n\nThe best pheasant hunting in the U.S. is in the Midwest and Plains states like Iowa or South Dakota, although pheasants can be found in other parts of the country., You can't just hunt anywhere.Public grounds often provide good hunting during cold weather or later in the season, but you will be competing with many other hunters, as well as their car doors and noisy friends possibly scaring off the birds.\nPublic grounds can be more challenging, and more dangerous since there will be less control over who is there and what they are doing.\nArrive early, and try to find less popular spots.\n\n, Dogs can smell better in cold, wet environments. It\u2019s also easier to track pheasants in mud and snow., The birds are out looking for food in lighter cover at those times and are more easily located.\n\n,\n\n\nIf the weather has been dry, the birds will gather near water.\n\n, They offer several benefits, including guides.\n\n\nThey often begin earlier than hunting season on public lands, so you can practice with your dog.

{"text":" For this recipe you will need the following items: Paring knife\nZester\nSaucepan\nCandy thermometer\nCandy molds\nAirtight storage container.;\n, Start by peeling the ginger with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. Fresh ginger is available at most supermarkets in the produce section.\nGinger has anti-inflammatory properties and is commonly used in cough remedies as an effective antihistamine and chest decongestant.Cut the ginger into very thin slices using a paring knife.\nUse a zester to get at least 1 teaspoon of lemon zest.\n\n, Bring this to a boil over high heat.You will know when the pot is at a full boil when you have a constant stream of large bubbles coming to the surface and a good deal of steam.\nOnce the pot has come to a full boil, reduce the heat to low.\n\n, Then remove the ginger and cinnamon stick. The easiest way to remove the spices is with a strainer.\nPlace a strainer into a clean saucepan.\nPour the hot mixture through the strainer.\nThe ginger and cinnamon will be left in the strainer and the liquid will be caught in the clean saucepan underneath.\n\n, Bring this mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Honey has been studied in clinical trials. It has been proven to be as effective as cough syrup in suppressing coughs. You will want the sugar to dissolve.\nYou can tell if the sugar is dissolved if you take a spoon of the liquid and cannot see any grains of sugar in it.\nOnce the sugar is dissolved, you will use a candy thermometer to get this syrup to the hard-crack candy stage.\n\n, You will use this to monitor the heat.The candy liquid will need to be heated to a high temperature in order to harden into lozenges.\nIt is very important that you closely watch the temperature of the syrup so it doesn't burn onto the saucepan or become too hot to form hard cough drops.\nThe goal temperature for hard-crack lozenges is 300-305 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n, It will rise quickly as you cook the liquid.As the liquid rises in temperature, it may darken. This is expected as the sugar in the syrup caramelizes.\nWhen the candy thermometer reaches 300-305 degrees, remove the liquid from heat.\nYou will now add the final ingredients before pouring the mixture to cool in candy molds.\n\n,\nAs you add the juice, it may cause the hot liquid to splash.\nStir completely to make sure the liquid is evenly mixed.\n\n, You can use unflavored cooking spray to do so. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the molds.\nTake care to fill only the small candy mold and not to spill too much of the liquid over the top each.\nThis recipe will make about 50 small lozenge sized pieces.\n\n, This will take an hour or more.When the cough drops are cool, crack them out of the molds onto wax paper.\nTo crack the drops out of the candy molds, tap the mold gently on a hard surface. The cough drops should fall out.\nYou may have to bend the candy mold tray in order to get the cough drops out, similar to cracking ice.\n\n, If you don't have superfine sugar at home, you can put regular granulated sugar in a food processor or blender. Process this until it is a finer consistency.Shake the jar to coat the cough drops with sugar.\nThis will prevent them from sticking together.\nYou can also use powdered sugar to coat the drops, but it tends to clump.\n\n, You don't need to refrigerate them.Use them as needed.\nSince these don't contain any of the common drugs found in cough syrups, these are ideal if you want to avoid the side effects of over-the-counter cough remedies.\nThe cough drops will have a pleasant, sweet taste of lemon, ginger, and cinnamon.\n\n, There are several suggestions for herbal medicines that are effective at treating coughs and colds. Elderberry and elderflower has been used to relieve congestion. Slippery elm has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat coughs and gastrointestinal conditions.Chamomile may be an effective treatment for coughs as it can help to reduce inflammation and mucus production.To make a strong tea, place a generous pinch of each herb into a cup of water in a saucepan.\nHeat the water and herbs to a simmer on high heat, then cover and reduce the heat.\nLet the tea steep for 15 to 20 minutes over the lowest heat.\nStrain out the herbs and reserve 1\/2 cup of the tea for the cough drops.\n\n, You can make DIY molds rather than using candy molds to make cough drops using sugar and a baking sheet.In a 9 x 13 pan or any cookie sheet, add a few cups of powdered sugar.\nUse your finger or a measuring spoon to make indentations in the sugar.\nThis is where you will pour the syrup for your cough lozenges.\n\n, Start by putting the 1\/2 cup of herbal tea from Step 1 into a saucepan, then add 1.5 cups of honey and 1\/2 teaspoon of peppermint extract.Use a medium to medium-high heat to heat up the ingredients.\nStir constantly to make sure all the ingredients are mixed.\nClip a candy thermometer on the side of the pan to monitor the temperature.\n\n, You will want it to get to about 300\u00a0\u00b0F (149\u00a0\u00b0C). This will allow the liquid to harden into lozenges as it cools.The mixture may get slightly foamy as it heats up.\nIf this occurs, give the cough drop liquid a stir.\nYou will be able to tell once the mixture gets near to the correct temperature as it will thicken.\nThis process generally takes about 30 minutes.\nOnce the liquid is at a temperature of 300 degrees, remove it from the heat.\n\n, Pour slowly and carefully.Pour the hot liquid into each of the small depressions in the powdered sugar on the baking sheet you prepared earlier.\nAlternatively, you can use a greased candy mold.\nIf you don't have a candy mold or don't want to use sugar, you can pour the liquid onto a piece of greased parchment paper. Be aware that this is the messiest way to do this.\n\n, Try not to disturb the cough drops as they cool.Once the drops have cooled, carefully move them out of their sugar molds. If using candy molds, crack the cough drops out of the molds.\nCoat the cough drops in powdered sugar.\nYou can store these in single layers between wax paper in the refrigerator for about 3 weeks.\nYou can also freeze them between layers of wax paper. If you choose to do so, they will last for several months.\n\n, This recipe calls for slippery elm powder, cinnamon, honey, orange essential oil and lemon essential oil.You can buy slippery elm bark and the essential oils from most health food stores, herbal shops, or online herbal retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs.\nSlippery elm contains a substance called mucilage. This becomes gel-like when combined with water or honey. This can help coat the mouth, throat, and digestive tract.Native Americans used this herbal remedy for centuries to calm coughs and gastrointestinal problems.Slippery elm has not been shown to cause any medical complications, unlike other herbal supplements. Little formal research has been conducted to show how effective it is at treating medical conditions. Remember that clinical studies have shown that honey is a very effective treatment for coughs. Cinnamon may also have some effectiveness at controlling a bad cough., Stir very thoroughly to combine.If the honey is too stiff has crystallized, try warming up the jar under warm water.\nThis should thin the honey or reconstitute it.\nSometimes this mixture is very dry and crumbly. If this is the case, you can add two more tablespoons of honey to make it easier to work with.\nWhen finished the mixture should resemble a soft dough. It may be sticky because of the honey.\n\n, Use a dropper to make sure you get the right amount of drops for each.You will need 10 drops of orange essential oil and 6 drops of lemon essential oil.\nMix these into the cough lozenge mixture thoroughly.\nYou want to make sure they are incorporated evenly into the dough.\n\n, These should be roughly the size of a teaspoon.Place these on a sheet of wax paper or parchment.\nYou can lay this on a counter or a baking sheet.\nPlace the lozenges in an area where they won't be disturbed.\nThese cough lozenges may not be very attractive but they contain effective ingredients.\n\n, You may need to leave them longer if you live in a humid climate.To store the lozenges, wrap them in wax paper.\nAlternatively, you can store them in an airtight jar.\nThese will last approximately 3 weeks when stored properly.\nThe recipe should make about 36 lozenges.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":575}
{"text":" If a new player asks how to play Mao, you have to tell them it's a frustrating card game and that you can't tell them the rules; they have to find out the specifics themselves. There is no limit to the number of players in a game, but you'll want a deck for every 4 to 5 players, maybe more if you have new players or complicated rules and are likely to need a lot of penalty cards.\n\n, He or she has the authority to initiate the game, choose what rules to use, judge and resolve disputes, and deal with any unusual complications that might arise.\n\n\nSince the dealer may be the only player who knows all the rules from the beginning of the game, it is critical that he or she enforces them consistently and fairly.\nSome groups prefer to have a second player who also knows the rules so that the two of them can call penalties on each other.\n\n, 5 to 8 cards per player is typical, but the exact amount doesn't matter as long as everyone gets the same number. Place the remainder of the deck in the center of the playing area to be used as a stock of penalty cards, then flip one card over and place it next to the deck to start.\n\n,, They vary with every game. Look below for guidelines to figuring out rules for each particular game of Mao.\n\n, In fact, no talking at all except when required by another rule, to call a point of order, or when in the middle of a point of order.;\n, Counterintuitive as this seems, you have to do it when mandated or else you'll receive another penalty card.\n\n, The game is similar to Uno in this respect, because you have to alert all the other players that you're close to winning, and if you don't you can be penalized.\n\n, Additionally, no playing out of turn or trying to call a penalty on another player if that player hasn't broken any rules--if you're going to disrupt the game, it's better not to play at all. If a player unintentionally inflicts a penalty on another player because they themselves do not fully understand the rules, any other player except the one penalized can inflict a penalty card on the first player for \"inflicting an incorrect penalty\".\n\n, They will then end their turn by adding this card to their hand.\n\n, A point of order occurs when the game comes to a halt so the players can confer and discuss to clarify certain things about the game, although they still cannot talk about the rules directly. Points of order are an important part of the Mao process, and come with their own rules, which are:\n\n\nDo not refer to the point of order directly by name (you can get around this by calling it \"P of O\", for example, or simply \"point order\", eliminating the \"of\")\nPlayers must not look at their cards during a Point of order. If they are still holding their cards after someone calls a Point of order, they can be penalized.\nThe point of order ends when someone calls \"point of disorder\", \"point taken\", or even just \"pick up your cards\"\nIn some variations, only the dealer can start and end points of order; however, you can allow anyone to do so in your game\nIn another variation, point of order must be said before and after you speak during play. Players who do not do so will be penalized for \"speaking out of turn.\"\n\n,,\nRequiring a player to draw penalty cards\nChanging which cards can be legally played to the discard pile\nRequiring a player to make a choice (such as specifying the value of a wild card).\n\n, It's up to you!\n\n\nMusical Chairs. A Four of Clubs forces everyone to get up from the table, run around once and sit back down in their original spot. The last player to make it back to their spot draws a penalty card.\nDeuces. A Two requires everyone to touch their middle and index fingers to the table. The last player to do so draws a penalty card.\nHave a Nice Day. A seven requires the next player to draw a penalty card. Sevens can add up, requiring players to draw 2, 3, 4, etc. penalty cards when multiple 7's are played in a row. Whoever plays it must say \"Have a (Very) (Very, Very) (etc.) Nice Day.\nRoyalty. A King requires a player to say \"All Hail the King (of spades)\". A Queen requires the player to say \"Neeumph\" (Queen of Spades).\nManners. A person must say \"Thank You\" when dealt a penalty card.\nSoap. Any cursing results in a penalty card.\nHoliday. A six requires a player to say \"Merry Christmas\".\nJacks. A Jack allows a player to change suits (wild card).\nSpades. Spade cards must be named when played.\nAces. Aces cause the next player to skip their turn.\nReverse. An eight causes the turn order to reverse.\nRhyme Fest. A nine causes the person who played it to say a word and all other players must say a rhyming word in turn without stating a previously said word. If a player says a non-rhyming word, takes too long to say a rhyming word, or says a previously stated word, he draws a penalty card.\nChauncey. If two identical cards are played in succession, everyone must say \"Chauncey\". The last player to do so draws a penalty card.\nDiamonds. If any card with a suit of a diamond is played, the person who played it must say \"Shine bright like a diamond\".\nChange of Suit.

This is because your weaknesses will likely only continue to deteriorate with time, given that they signify the area with brain damage.Unfortunately, sign language does not work as an alternative mode of communication for people with progressive aphasia, as it relies on the same areas of the brain that are already damaged due to the disease.Using apps on an iPhone or an iPad that can speak for a person may be of help.\nHaving family members and friends communicate simply and clearly can also aid with comprehension.\n\n, All she can do is help you to develop strategies to manage your condition most effectively, and to preserve your language and communication abilities for as long as possible by working with you on adaptive techniques.\n\n\nIt is important to know that the condition cannot be cured, so as not to have unrealistically high expectations of the therapist you are working with.\n\n, Not only does it aid in not feeling alone, but you may also pick up valuable tips and strategies by seeing how others have coped with their illness.\n\n\nCheck to see if there is an Aphasia Community Group in your area.\n\n, To avoid the confusion of others not understanding your difficulties, some people find it helpful to carry printed information about their illness and to bring it with them to public or social situations.\n\n\nYou may wish to carry an ID card with you, if introducing yourself clearly and coherently is a problem.\nYou may also wish to carry a small amount of printed information detailing your condition and explaining how it is best for people to interact with you, as this can help to smooth your ability to fit in socially.\n\n, Because progressive aphasia is a condition that is usually mild at the start, and progresses at a slow rate, many people can continue working for several years even after being diagnosed with the condition. You may wish to let your boss know that you have the condition, and\/or to ask for modified duties should you find that it is interfering with your ability to effectively communicate (either in written or spoken language) in your current job.\n\n\nYou may also wish to look into whether you have any employee insurance or other health care coverage that can help with medical appointments, and\/or with paid time off work.\n\n, In progressive aphasia, you will have only language and communication deficits on exam. You will have no other mental challenges, such as problems with your memory, with your physical ability to perform day-to-day tasks, or with any of your other thinking processes.\n\n\nYour doctor can run through a series of cognitive tests with you to rule out other common conditions, such as Alzheimer's dementia.\n\n, Your doctor will be able to rule out other conditions such as a stroke or a traumatic brain injury by performing a neurological exam, as well as by offering you a head CT or MRI which can give further insight into any anatomical or structural problems.\n\n\nProgressive aphasia will show shrinkage of certain brain tissues (related to the language functions) on CT scan.\nHowever, the appearance of progressive aphasia can be differentiated on imaging from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury.\n\n, Progressive aphasia occurs when brain cells in the areas related to language malfunction and die. It is usually caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). (It is important to note that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia.)FTLD occurs when parts of the brain atrophy or shrink,and AD is caused by microscopic abnormalities in the brain.When FTLD and AD occur in the areas of brain that control speech and language, the person develops progressive aphasia.Progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD in 60\u201370% of cases and AD in 30\u201340%. Whether progressive aphasia is caused by FTLD or AD can only be determined by autopsy.In most cases, progressive aphasia is not genetic.Remember that progressive aphasia is not the same as Alzheimer's dementia \u2014 while language skills degenerate, the person should be completely functional otherwise. A person with progressive aphasia usually can continue taking care of himself and pursue hobbies and interests.A person with Alzheimer's dementia will experience a progressive loss of all cognitive function, not just speech.Progressive aphasia is also not caused by brain trauma, stroke, tumor, or infection., This condition is one that is not curable, and can only be managed as best as possible as it continues to progress gradually with time. (This is another feature that differentiates it from a stroke or a traumatic brain injury, as both of these can show improvements with time and a slow regaining of function, rather than a continual deterioration.)\n\n\nWhen you understand that the goal is to effectively manage the condition, rather than to cure it, it can help you to go into your doctor's and therapist's appointments with realistic expectations in terms of what they can do for you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":577}
{"text":" If they are extremely tight, spray some lubricant on the nuts - a silicone lubricant or even vegetable oil will do the trick very well. (Many modern bikes will not have nuts. They have a quick-release which you can easily loosen and remove the wheel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Every brake setup is a little different but you should likely be able to slip the brake cable out of a socket on the brake arms to release them. Some brakes may require that you loosen the cable from a clamped position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If it's the rear wheel, you will need to lift the chain clear of the gear cluster. To ease the removal of a rear wheel, shift the chain to the smallest gear on the wheel before loosening the skewer or nuts. If it's the front wheel, it will be easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, With a presta valve you need to unscrew the top part of the stem to release the air in the tube. During this step you'll also want to remove the lock ring that screws onto the stem and sits flush on the rim if your bike has one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, With all the air out of the tube squeeze the tire together and you'll see the tire release from the inside of the rim, this will help when removing the tire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You can use the handle of a spoon or similar object if you don't have tire levers but be very careful, as you risk scratching or damaging the rims of the wheel and\/or puncturing the inner tube. Ease one lever in under the wheel rim and lever out the edge of the tire (taking great care not to puncture the inner tube) and pry it up over the wheel rim. Move around the rim about an eighth of the circumference and repeat the process again, leaving the first tool in place. Now zip the second lever around the wheel and the tire should come right off on one side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,, Best way to find an air leak is by inserting the tube with air in water. Where air bubbles come out , there is a hole in your tube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Use caution when feeling inside the tire as a nail, or glass can cut you. Be sure to remove any thorns, glass, or nails with pliers if you find them. Adjust rim tape to cover protruding spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Unwrap your new tube and remove the plastic dust cap and the lock ring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Putting a few pumps of air in the tube before will help to avoid pinching the tube when putting the tire on the rim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This process is difficult but try not to use tire levers, a screwdriver, or other similar object as you vastly increase your chance of puncturing your new tube. Check the tire wall for an arrow or similar to indicate the direction of rotation - some tires have a \"direction specific\" tread pattern. Put one side in first, then ease the partially inflated tube into the tire and put the other side on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,,,,,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":578}
{"text":" Contract the corners of your mouth to form a round shape with your mouth before phrases like \u201cOh dear\u201d or \u201cMinnes-ohhh-ta\u201d and extend the emphasis on this vowel.\n\n\nThis is a similarity to Canadian accents in some areas.\nPractice by saying the word \u201cSound\u201d. While it only has one syllable and can be said quickly, a Minnesotan might say \u201cS-ownd\u201d or \u201cS-ow-und\u201d as a part of regular speech.;\n, The \u201cI\u201d should be drawn out and spoken with the mouth open and the tongue behind the bottom front teeth. This is also true when using names and words with the letter \u201cy\u201d.\n\n\nPractice by saying the word \u201cWhy\u201d and drawing out the vowel.\n\n, For example, the words \u201care,\u201d \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d rely more heavily on the letter \u201cR\u201d in the Minnesota dialect. Stress the \u201cerr\u201d sound.\n\n\nTry saying the phrase \u201cOh, dear\u201d to practice the \u201cO\u201d and the \u201cR\u201d together. It can sound like \u201cOo-ha, De-arr\u201d.\n\n, This is often called \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d because they use an inquisitive tone when speaking with other people. There are several changes in tone throughout a sentence.\n\n\nUse the phrase \u201cOh, that\u2019s interesting\u201d. Although it is a statement and shouldn\u2019t end with an inflection, the Midwestern accent would include an upward inflection with the word \u201cinteresting\u201d. it is basically being passive in an aggressive way.\n\n, Thanks to a large influx of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries, the Minnesota accent has a sing-song quality, employing inflections and words like \u201cYah\u201d for \u201cYes\u201d.Try the comic phrase \u201cYa sure, you betcha\u201d to practice your use of the regional pronunciation.\n\n, For example, \u201cHave to\u201d is often \u201chafta\u201d, while \u201cI\u2019m going to\u201d is \u201ceye-mina\u201d and \u201cwhat are you\u201d is \u201cwhat-cha\u201d.\n\n, It is a generic, but common reply to questions like \u201cYou doing alright?\u201d or \u201cAre you full?\u201d\n\n, Almost all of Minnesota and most of the Midwest call Coke, Pepsi and other sodas \u201cpop\u201d.\n\n, For example, \u201cI didn\u2019t buy that dress because it was too spendy\u201d.\n\n, Other like \u201ccan\u201d are pronounced with a similar soft \u201ceh\u201d sound.\n\n, This phrase and \u201cNice to meet you\u201d are used to indicate you\u2019d like to depart. You also might want to draw out your goodbye like a true Minnesotan and talk about the weather, sports, and politics. This is known as the \"Minnesotan goodbye\".\n\n, For example, \u201ccash\u201d is sometimes pronounced \u201ccaish\u201d. The word \u201cdifferent\u201d is often pronounced with two syllables as \u201cdiff-rent\u201d.,, This is the act of being outwardly nice, without conveying your real opinions or emotions. It is often referred to as \u201cpassive aggressive\u201d or \u201centhusiastic neutral\u201d tone because of the friendly inflections while saying something negative.\n\n, This form of non-verbal communication is used when driving and greeting oncoming cars or pedestrians. You lift your index finger off the steering wheel for a second and set it back down.\n\n, If someone asks your opinion and you want to show a little opinion, \u201cthat\u2019s different\u201d will show that you don\u2019t like it, without having to go into detail., Minnesotans may talk while at a 45-degree angle or while looking out at something else. This is a way of remaining nice, non-confrontational, but not too personal.\n\n, It\u2019s better to say \u201cNot bad\u201d than \u201cNot good\u201d.\n\n\nPronounce \u201cNot Bad\u201d as \u201cNaaht Bah-d\u201d.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":579}

{"text":" A personal allowance reduces your taxable income. The more allowances you claim on your W-4, the less money will be withheld from your paycheck for taxes. In contrast, if you claim fewer allowances, more money will be withheld from your paycheck for taxes., Generally, parents claim their children as dependents, but you can claim other relatives if you provide over half of their support and they meet the other IRS requirements to qualify as a dependent.If no one is claiming you as a dependent, you can enter a \"1\" in the blank provided for line A on the form.\n\n, In line B, you will enter \"1\" to claim an additional allowance if you are single and only have one job. You also need to enter \"1\" if you are married, have only one job, and your spouse doesn't work, or if the total income from all work is $1,500 or less., If you are married, enter a \"1\" in the blank for line C to claim the allowance. If you have a working spouse or more than one job, you can enter \"0\" or leave the line blank if you prefer your taxes to be withheld at the higher single rate., If you have any children or other dependents, enter that number in the blank for line D., You qualify for Head of Household if you are unmarried and pay for at least half of the household expenses of your dependents.\n\n\nIf this description applies to you, enter a \"1\" in the blank for line E.Allowances you claim decrease the amount of money that is withheld from your paycheck for taxes. Therefore, if you are unsure whether you qualify as Head of Household, you should leave the line blank. If you have too little withheld from your paycheck for taxes, you'll end up owing the federal government money.,, This credit allows you to reduce your tax liability by as much as $1,000 per qualifying child. Sons, daughters, stepchildren, foster children, and siblings generally are included as qualifying children for the purposes of this credit.If your total income for the year will be between $65,000 and $84,000, or between $100,000 and $119,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter a \"1\" for each qualifying child in the blank for line G.If your total income will be less than $65,000, or less than $100,000 if you are married filing jointly, enter \"2\" for each qualifying child. Subtract one if you have between two and four qualifying children; subtract two if you have five or more qualifying children.For example, if you have three children, you would enter \"5\" in the blank for line G: 2 + 2 + 2 - 1 = 5.\n\n,, If you plan to itemize your deductions, you'll need to complete the Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. If you have more than one job, or if you're married and both you and your spouse work, you'll need to fill out the Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet.If neither of those descriptions applies to you, you can enter the amount from line H directly into line 5 on your withholding allowance certificate., In the boxes numbered 1 and 2, you will enter your first and last name, address, and Social Security number., In box 3, you must check the appropriate square to indicate whether you are single, married, or married but want taxes withheld from your paycheck at the higher single rate.You are considered single if you are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated according to state law. You also are considered single if you are married but your spouse is a nonresident of the United States.\nYou are considered married if you are married according to state law. If your relationship status on the last day of the year is \"married,\" then for the purposes of federal taxes you are married for the entire year.You can choose to withhold taxes at a single rate, which is higher, if you are married but would prefer to have more money kept from your paycheck., Take the number you entered in line H of your Personal Allowance Worksheet, or the result from the other worksheets you needed to use on the second page, and write it in box 5., You may want additional money withheld, for example if you have other taxes such as self-employment taxes to pay.If you do, write down that amount as a dollar figure in box 6., If you had no tax liability last year, and expect a full refund this year, you can write \"exempt\" in box 7., You've finished filling out the form, but it isn't valid until you sign and date it, declaring under penalty of perjury that all the information you provided is true and complete.When you've completed and signed your form, return it to your employer. Check your pay stubs to ensure the proper amount of money is being withheld each pay period.\n\n, You may want to add allowances if you received a large refund and would like to keep more money in your paycheck. In contrast, you may want to decrease your number of allowances if you had to pay the IRS last year.\n\n\nIf any event happens that changes your withholding status, such as a birth or a divorce, you must file a new W-4 with your employer within 10 days of the event's occurrence., You should use this worksheet only if you plan on itemizing your deductions such as mortgage interest, or taking certain credits or adjustments.This worksheet also takes into account other non-wage income you might have, such as dividends and interest.\n\n, Deductions reduce your tax liability. You can take the standard deduction, or itemize your deductions. Typically people choose to itemize their deductions when their total itemized deductions are greater than the standard deduction.For example, suppose you are single when you file your taxes in 2015. Your standard deduction would be $6,300. When you add up your itemized deductions, the total is $5,000. In that situation, you probably would choose to take the standard deduction.Enter the dollar amount of your estimated itemized deductions in the blank on line 1., The worksheet provides the standard deduction amounts based on your filing status. For example, if you are married filing jointly in 2015, you would enter $12,600 on line 2.\n\n, If the result of that calculation is zero or a negative number, write \"0\" in the blank on line 3. To continue the previous example, subtracting $6,300 from $5,000 would produce a negative number, so you'd enter \"0\" on line 3., and enter that amount on line 4. Adjustments, also called \"above-the-line deductions,\" are amounts such as IRA contributions or student loan interest that you claim directly on your 1040 or 1040A.To continue the example, suppose you paid $2,000 in student loan interest that you planned to claim on your taxes. You would enter $2,000 on line 4.\n\n, This is the total amount of deductions, credits, and adjustments you estimate you will claim in the year you fill out the W-4. If you are claiming tax credits, you will have to complete an additional worksheet to convert those credits to withholding allowances.The total in the example for line 5 would be $7,000.\n\n, Non-wage income includes money you receive without working for it, such as interest or alimony.If you received $500 in interest income, for example, you'd enter $500 on line 6.\n\n, If the result is zero or a negative number, enter \"0.\"To continue the example, you would subtract $500 from $7,000. The result is not zero or a negative number, so you would enter the result of $6,500 on line 7.\n\n, In the example, you would divide $6,500 by $4,000 and the result would be 1.625. You would drop the decimals and enter \"1\" on line 8., Since in the example you are single with no dependents, you have \"1\" on line H as well.\n\n, If you're planning on completing the Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet, enter the total on the first line of that worksheet. If you don't need that worksheet, enter this number on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate.To finish up the example, you would enter \"2\" on your Withholding Allowance Certificate.\n\n, The Two-Earners\/Multiple Jobs Worksheet is designed to make sure that single people with more than one job, or married couples who both work, have the correct amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks.You should only use this worksheet if the instructions under line H on your Personal Allowance Worksheet directed you to do so., However, if the highest paying job pays $65,000 or less, you should not enter a number greater than \"3.\"\n\n,\n\n\nIf the number on line 1 is greater than or equal to the number on line 2, subtract line 2 from line 1. Enter that number on line 3 and on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate, and you are done with this worksheet.If the number on line 1 is less than the number on line 2, enter \"0\" on line 5 of your Withholding Allowance Certificate. You should then complete the rest of the worksheet to figure out what additional amount to have withheld from your paycheck. This will help you avoid having to pay the IRS when you file your taxes., If you entered \"0\" on line 5, the worksheet includes some additional calculations so you won't be facing a big tax bill in April.Line 4 instructs you to enter the number from line 2 of the same worksheet. This was the number that corresponded to the lowest paying job. Assume, for example, that number was \"3.\"\nOn line 5 you'll need to enter the number from line 1 on the same worksheet, which was the final number you arrived at on line 10 of your Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet. To continue the example, assume that number was \"1.\"\nNow subtract line 5 from line 4 and enter the result in line 6. In the example, the result would be \"2.\"\nUsing table 2 provided on the worksheet, find the amount that corresponds to the highest paying job. Assume you are married filing jointly, and your highest paying job pays $50,000 a year. According to the table, you should enter $600 on line 7.\nNow multiply line 7 by line 6 and enter the result on line 8. This is the total amount of additional withholding needed. In the example, that number would be $1,200.\nAll you need to do now is divide that number by the number of pay periods remaining in the year. This depends on how often you're paid and what time of year you start. If you started the job for which you're filling out a W-4 in February and will be paid monthly, you would divide $1,200 by 10 because there are 10 pay periods left in the year. The result of that calculation, $120, is the additional amount of money that needs to be withheld from your paychecks. This is the amount you'd enter on your Withholding Allowance Certificate.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":581}

These situations include:\n\n\nWhen the child sees a fire, smells smoke, or the fire alarm is activated.\nIf the child witnesses a crime, or believes that his or someone else's safety is endangered.\nIf the child was in an accident where people were injured, or if they are injured themselves.\nIf someone is sick and needs medical help, either on the street or at home.\nIf the child is lost and does not know where he is or how to contact his parents.\n\n, However, it's also important to explain to your child the situations in which it is not appropriate to call 911. Explain to your child that the policemen, doctors and firemen are very busy people and do not have time to respond to calls that are not serious. Examples of non-serious situations might include:\n\n\nIf the child has an escaped pet.\nIf the child falls and scratches their knee.\nIf the child breaks or loses his bike.\n\n, Let your child know that he or she should never call 911 out of boredom or for a joke. Explain that in some countries, this is even a criminal offense. Also explain that by calling 911 unnecessarily, they may be blocking the line for someone who really needs help.\n\n, Explain to the child that 911 should be called from a safe location. Explain to your child that they must get away from any dangerous places and ensure that their life is not in danger before making the call.\n\n\nFor example, if there is a fire, the child should leave the house before calling. If they think that someone has broken into the house, they should try to get out and go to a neighbor's before calling.\nHowever, there are also situations where the child should stay exactly where they are. For example, if someone is sick or injured, the child should stay with them. Let them know that the dispatcher who answers the 911 call can give them information on how to help the sick or injured person., Talk to your child about possible emergencies. Explain the possible situations in which a child should call 911. Encourage your child to name all these situations.\n\n\nAsk questions such as: \u201cWhat will you do when you see a car accident?\u201d or \u201cWhat would you do if you were alone at home, and see that mom is not well?\u201d \u201cWhat if your friend fell, hit his head and lost consciousness?\"\nThis will help your child to recognize the specific situations in which they might need to call 911. This preparation could be vital when it comes to an actual emergency.\n\n, The child must know their own address, name, last name, and parents\u2019 names. Explain that this is because the dispatcher will ask him who is calling, what the emergency is and where it is located, in order to send help.\n\n\nIf someone in the family suffers from a chronic illness and has frequent problems, instruct the child to call 911 when they see certain symptoms. Write down the name of the disease or condition on a piece of paper and make sure the child knows where to find it.\nIn this way, the child will be able to provide this vital information to the dispatcher, which can be extremely helpful once the ambulance arrives.\n\n, Teach your child how to describe their surroundings, in case the emergency happens outside of the home and the child doesn't know where they are.\n\n\nTeach your child to look for stress signs or distinct characteristics of the buildings around them. This will help the dispatcher to send an ambulance\/firetruck\/police car to the correct location as quickly as possible., Instruct your child not to panic when they are making the 911 call. Explain that they need to talk to the dispatcher as slowly and calmly as possible.\n\n\nTell them to answer any questions that the dispatcher might have, in order to give as much information as possible.\nTell them to listen carefully to the dispatcher and to try to follow any instructions the dispatcher gives as closely as possible.\n\n, If the child does not wait until the end of the call, they might miss out on providing or receiving vital information that could affect someone\u2019s life.\n\n, If your accidentally call 911, explain to them that they should not hang up. Tell them they should wait for the dispatcher to answer and then explain that there is no emergency.\n\n\nOtherwise, the dispatcher may locate the call and send help where it is not needed, wasting resources and potentially delaying help to someone who really needs it.\n\n, Have at least one telephone that the child can easily reach and access all times. It's no use teaching them how to call 911 if they can't get to a phone in case of emergency.\n\n, Make sure your child knows how to use a cell phone and how to unlock it. Teach your child the password (if you have one) and show them how to get to the keyboard from the home screen.\n\n, Older phones (such as those at grandma's and grandpa's house) may have a circular dialer. If this is the case, your should show your child how to call from such a phone.\n\n\nA finger should be placed at the desired number and the dialer should be turned to the right, all the way to the end.\n\n, Explain to the child that 911 means nine-one-one. Never refer to it as nine-hundred-and-eleven or nine-eleven. In a critical situation, the child may lose time if they expect the phone's keyboard to have the number eleven or ninety-one.\n\n\nTo younger children, explain the difference between the numbers 6 and 9. Point out that 9 has a circle which is above as its head, and that 6 has a circle at the bottom, like it's sitting on it.\n\n, This is the best way for children to learn and the best way to assess the skills of your child Let the child wait for dial tone (you can act it out or play a recording tone from another phone to prepare the child for how the tone sounds)\n\n\nLet the child act out calling 911. First the number 9, then 1, and then 1 again.\nAct the part of the dispatcher. Ask questions like who's calling, where are you calling from and why.\nTeach your child to speak loudly. Get them to repeat information if they didn't say it loudly enough and encourage them to ask you (the dispatcher) to explain again if they aren't clear on the instructions., You can make an appointment with a local dispatcher to do a practice call with your child. Call 911 and ask the dispatcher if he is free to practice with your child right now or if he need to make an appointment.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":583}
{"text":" Obviously, if you are faking sick on the weekend so you can avoid going to school on Monday, you will be busy faking sick and won't have much time to do the things you enjoy. If there's something you definitely want to do, try to squeeze it in quickly before faking your \"sickness\".;\n, Either way, both are a perfect choice. If you start the sickness too early on Saturday, you will have to keep up the masquerade all weekend and Monday, and it will be very hard and your chances of succeeding in fooling your parents that you're sick will be limited and slim.\n\n, Make sure it is something that you don't get often, because if you have faked sick before and used the same excuse too many times, don't try it again or your parents will become suspicious of whether you are really sick or not. If you choose to start the \"sickness\" faking in the night hours of Saturday, go to your parents' room at roughly 11:00pm or 1:00am, or any time between those two, maybe a bit later, and complain of whatever sickness it is you're using.\n\n, Your parents, if they are the sort that try to convince you, \"it was just a dream, there's no monsters\", you are likely to be tucked back into your own bed, but if your parents understand how freaked out you get after nightmares, they'll probably let you stay in their room until the night is over. If they do this, say that you feel like you're going to vomit and go and get a bucket, bowl or plastic bag for you to \"vomit\" in. This way, your parents will think that you really are sick and won't suspect you of going to so much trouble simply to fake sickness.\n\n,, or \"How will I get through P.E. feeling so sick?\" but make sure you only point out things they know you enjoy doing.\n\n, Also, remember to delete your computer's internet history or else your parents will definitely send you to school Monday.\n\n, Beware, though, you also must sacrifice your Monday and be \"sick\" for the whole of that day.\n\n, Also remember to be very, very convincing that you are sick because Monday is the day most kids choose to fake sickness, because they want an extra day off and are not ready for the weekend to end.\n\n, Stay under the covers a lot and breathe on your hands, then rub them on your face, but if a thermometer is involved, try breathing on it behind your parents' backs, but if it becomes too hot your parents will suspect you of being seriously ill and needing the hospital, or they will know you are faking sickness and had breathed on the thermometer.\n\n, Find something like baby powder and put it all over your face, then wash all off but it will leave a slightly pale effect. If you are pale, your parents will be more likely to believe that you're sick.\n\n, Don't eat anything that's offered to you, but if you do accept it only pick off a little bit and chew it slowly to show that you've lost your appetite and definitely are sick. If your parents are insistent on you eating something, tell them \"I'm not hungry!\" but not too rudely or loudly. They might reconsider your \"sickness\" if you have the energy to be yelling and objecting.\n\n, Ask for covers and fake sleeping. If you tend to twitch a lot when you fake sleeping, pull the covers right over you. Your parents are likely, though, to peer into the covers and see how you're doing. Some tips to making sure you fool them into thinking you're really sleeping are:\n\n\nDon't move a lot. When they're not looking, if you're uncomfortable move slightly. Only move about every 20 minutes or so. If you keep tossing and turning, they're going to know for sure that you're not actually sleeping and are faking.\nStay still. Breathe calmly and casually, like you normally would if you were really asleep or very relaxed. This way they'll think you're deeply sleeping and your body is working on getting you better from your \"sickness\".\nWhen you wake up from your \"sleeping\", remember to make sounds like you're sick and uncomfortable. Say something like \"ow\", which will definitely spark your parents' interest and they will likely ask, \"What's wrong?\" or think to themselves that you can't go to school on Monday.\n\n, Definitely don't do anything you enjoy doing, because not doing it will convince your parents that you're sick if you're turning down one of your favourite things\/hobbies to do. Also remember to work hard and go to a lot of trouble to fake your \"sickness\". Your parents will never suspect you of faking sickness if you go to a lot of trouble to convince them you're sick.\n\n, There are many dangers and cautions involving this. You should also remember that your parents might just have a trick up their sleeves to catch you out in the act of faking sickness. If you honestly are hungry, you should eat something when your parents aren't going to notice, but this is also a possible danger. Your parents could catch you eating when you have \"no appetite\".\n\n, While you are busy reading this, your parents might be reading about what kids do to fake sickness.\n\n, There are articles about doing that that could help you in achieving those things. To fake vomit, you could try chewing something, and bring it back up your throat when it's not too far down. Read the article on wikiHow about making fake diarrhea if you want to know how to do that.\n\n, Cough and say something to yourself like, \"I wish Mum and Dad were awake to help me\", right outside your parents' bedroom door, but as soon as they wake up quickly run to the bathroom or toilet and play the \"innocence act\". Act like nothing happened and you were just talking to yourself as you walked past their bedroom and that you didn't intend to wake them up.\n\n, Otherwise, if they notice that you are trying very hard to get the point across that you're \"sick\", they will begin to suspect that perhaps you're not sick after all. Just try hard enough for them to decide you're sick.\n\n, This way, they will think you're sick and won't take you to the doctor because you feel \"dizzy\" whenever you try to \"get up\".\n\n, During the night, while you know your parents are sleeping (and any other members of your family) quickly go to the bathroom tap or the kitchen tap and wet yourself. Dry yourself but make sure you remain cold enough to have goosebumps. Once you're certain you aren't wet but have goosebumps, go into your parents' room and complain that you're cold.\n\n, Then go to your parents' room again and complain of stomach, headache, fever or something like that. This will be your last shot at faking before the morning. Remember to keep up the masquerade in the morning as well. Wake up early deliberately to make it seem like you really do need the day off because you won't be focusing to your best at school due to going to bed late and waking up early. Act like it was your sickness that woke you up so early and kept you up so late.\n\n, Spend a fair amount of time in the toilet (with the door shut) and then flush. Make sure your parents don't see the toilet before you flush it, because they will detect no waste to be found in the toilet bowl.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":584}

{"text":" Before starting the job there is a number of required tools you must have. They're listed in the Things You'll Need section of this page. Most should be available with a basic garage tool set. If you don't have a specific one, most auto parts stores will allow you to rent one out by paying a deposit which is returned after the tool is.\n\n.\n, Now that you have all the tools to do the job you'll need to make sure it's done safely. Safety glasses, closed or steel toe shoes, working gloves and preferably pants are all recommended., Place chocks or a solid piece of wood behind either of the rear wheels to prevent the car from moving.\n\n, Loosen the front lug nuts using a breaker bar and a 19mm socket. Do not remove the lug nuts completely! A quarter of a turn in the counter clockwise direction should be enough.\n\nIf you have a wheel lock nut, always remove it first and install last!\n\n, This will unlock the wheel and keep your battery off.\n\nMake sure to roll down a window or keep a door open so you don't lock your keys in the car.\n\n, Place a small wooden board between the jack and the frame to prevent any damage. You don't have to worry about this if the lifting surface of your jack is rubber., Watch for any movement or slippage of the jack. If positioned properly it will lift the vehicle straight and directly upwards. If you see any tilt or slippage, stop immediately. Assess the situation and lower the car very slowly. Re-position the jack properly and repeat the lifting procedure., This should be enough the position the jack stands underneath the support location. It is identified by two cutouts in the pinch-weld of the car., Then lower the jack onto them until they touch. It is always a good idea to leave the jack just touching the lifting spot, it provides additional safety and saves time later on when lowering the car., Do this by giving the car a slight push down on the hood and sideways on the fender.\n\n, Turn the steering wheel in the direction such that it gives you better access to caliper bolts. (Working on the drivers side, turn the wheel to the left)., Using a ratcheting wrench and a 15mm socket. On this model they are integrated with caliper pins so put them on a rag to be cleaned and re-greased later. Notice that the pins are different. One of them has a rubber insert on it and that one always goes in the top caliper hole., Do this by tugging on it or placing a small pry bar between it and the rotor to pry it off. Use a rubber strap or a piece of wire to secure the rotor to the suspension spring. This will prevent any potential damage to the brake hose.\n\n\n\nIf the caliper pin bolts do not move and appear to be seized, stop immediately! Put the wheels back on and have an automotive shop perform the brake job. Removing seized caliper pins requires additional tools.\n\n, Using a 15mm socket. These may be very tight and it might be easier to loosen with a breaker bar. Remove the bolts and remove the caliper bracket. Use a small hammer to make the pads come out of the bracket. Although sometimes they can be removed by hand.\n\n, Do this by pulling and wiggling it side to side. If it is stuck use penetrating oil in the holes where the lug studs come out, let it rest for a few minutes. Proceed to tap the back of the rotor with a hammer while alternating sides to gradually remove it from the hub.\n\n, It does not have to be perfect, as long as major rust is removed.\n\n\nIf your pads came with hardware (metal shims) you can remove the old ones from the caliper bracket and use a wire brush to clean the rust off from underneath the old shims.\nIf you do not have new shims, do not remove the old ones. Just use the wire brush to clean the rust off from the top of the old shims.\n\n,, You will notice it is oily. This is done by the manufacturer to prevent corrosion while storing and transporting parts. This oil film needs to be removed by spraying all rotor surfaces with brake parts cleaner. Be very careful using this spray since it is a strong irritant to the eyes and skin. Always use protective eye-ware and gloves.\n\n\nBrake parts cleaner usually dries and evaporates pretty quickly but if it does not just wipe it off with a clean rag. It is always a good idea to compare the new rotor to the old one and verify they are the same size.\n\n, Take one of the lug nuts and thread it on any stud by hand as far as it will go. This will make the rotor stay in place and ease the rest of the installation.\n\n, Your caliper bracket should be free of rust on the shim surface at this point. If you removed the old shims, install the new ones now. A good set of brake pads usually comes with a small packet of high temperature brake grease. Apply a very small amount of grease onto the shim surfaces as shown in the picture.\n\n\nManufacturer calls to put thread locking compound onto the caliper bolts.\n\n, Torque the bolts to 133 lb.ft (180 N.m).\n\n, If you look closely you may notice the brake pads are not the same. Two of them should be with small tabs on them and two without. The pad with a small tab goes on the inside surface of the rotor.\n\n, This might be a little tricky. Install the far part of the pad first and gently push in the middle of the pad. It should slide right in. Do the same on the outer side of the caliper bracket.\n\n, In order to do this you need to compress the piston first. It is recommended that you open the bleeder and let the fluid drain out into the drain pan below. Use a 10mm wrench to brake loose the bleeder. Do not use excessive force. If the bleeder does not come loose, stop immediately! Breaking the bleeder will render the caliper unusable and you will have to purchase a new one. If the bleeder does not come lose, open the hood of the car and remove the cap from the brake fluid reservoir, this will release pressure as the caliper piston is being compressed., Position the large C-clamp on the caliper as shown in the picture below. Begin to turn the handle of the C-clamp to compress the piston until it is flush with the surface of the caliper. If the piston is very hard to move, your caliper might be seized and will have to be replaced.\n\n, Discard the old brake pad., Failure to perform this step correctly will cause your brake pedal to be very soft and may become a safety issue.\n\n\nEnsure that the pin boots are not folded over and are positioned in the way that the pins will fit in them.\n\n, Remember that the pin with a rubber insert goes in the top hole and through the rubber pin boot. Tighten the bolts and torque them to 70 lb.ft (95 N.m).\n\nRemove the lug nut supporting the rotor on the hub.\n\n, Afterwards replace the cap of the brake fluid reservoir., Put the wheels back on the studs and hand tighten the lug nuts. Remember to keep the wheel flush on the surface of the rotor. Tighten the lug nuts as much as you can by holding the wheel with your free hand., Stop lowering immediately after the wheels make contact with the ground. There should be minimal weight on the wheels. Just enough to prevent them from moving., If you have a locking nut make sure to install it last and never toque it; just hand tighten. A good way to retain the star pattern and make the locking nut last to be tightened is to start torquing the lug nut directly opposite of the locking nut.\n\n, It is a good idea to check or remove all the tools and old parts from underneath the car before lowering it., Repeat this 3-4 times or until the pedal gets stiff.,, Make sure everything is working properly and that there is no abnormal noise.

{"text":" Vanilla orchids require a tropical environment, so you will need sunlight, heat, space and humidity for it to grow. If you live in the South of the United States, Australia or another warm climate you may be able to cultivate vanilla outside.\n\n\nYour environment should be 65 degrees (18 Celsius) or warmer all year to successfully cultivate an orchid. Warmer temperatures are preferable.;\n, You can improve the greenhouse conditions until they are ideal for this type of orchid that requires heat, humidity and partial shade.\n\n, If you don\u2019t have a local florist or garden center that sells these, you may need to order them online. Ensure each cutting is at least one foot (30 cm) long.\n\n\nIf you are ordering cuttings online, you may want to purchase several to improve your chances of having a vanilla crop.\nCuttings are usually taken from mature plants that are 20 feet (6 m) or more in length.\n\n,, The ends should remain immersed for five days. Notice which end is the top and which is the bottom.\n\nAdd a pinch of liquid fertilizer to improve results.\nThe top is the direction in which the plant has been growing. The leaves will point down toward the bottom of the cutting., It will need shade 50 percent of the time, as well as constant support to grow vines. If you are using a trellis, you will need to create a shaded area above the plant.\n\n, Lay the bottom two nodes of the plant horizontally on the top of the soil. Nodes are vine intersections.\n\n\nOrchid soil is usually a combination of pine bark, perlite and mulch.\n\n,, It must be trained to grow vertically. You can purchase ties or clips online or at a gardening store.\n\n,, Never allow the soil to dry out, yet don\u2019t allow it to get too saturated or it can rot.\n\n, The mulch is its food so it should be rich in organic matter.\n\n,, Air roots will attach upward to the support and others will reach down to the soil. It will take between two and seven years for the plant to grow large enough to bloom.\n\n, It will encourage roots to grow and the plant to grow larger., It only flowers for a six week period per year and the flowers only last approximately one day.During this time, you will need to hand pollinate the flower in order to grow the vanilla beans.\n\n, Consider asking a local orchid grower to help you hand-pollinate the first few times. It is a very delicate process.\n\n, Push the pollen mass out and hold it up with your right thumb and index finger. Use your middle finger to push the anther back and expose the cam underneath it, which serves as a shield.\n\n\nPlace the pollen on the ridge. Push the ridge back into place with your left hand and pull the cap back down.\nRepeat with all the flowers.\nPollinate in the morning. Some sources suggest 11 am is the best time., If it begins to elongate instead of point up, it is pollinated.\n\n, Pods should appear within two months; however, they take nine months to mature.\n\n,, Spread your beans on trays and place them in direct sunlight for three hours. Fold them inside cloth to sweat overnight.\n\n\nRepeat each day until the pods turn a deep brown.\nHang them or place them in drying rooms for two to four weeks.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":593}

{"text":" By regulating his feeding, sleeping, playing, and bathroom schedule, you help him fit comfortably into your life. The routine will bring him comfort, and you\u2019ll have fewer \u201caccidents\u201d down the road.;\n, After that, they should get 2-3 meals a day until they reach adulthood. Feed your puppy the amount recommended on the label. Many labels give only the total amount a dog should eat during the day. You\u2019ll need to divide those amounts into portions throughout the day.\n\n\nTo ensure the puppy grows well, feed him in meals instead of leaving food out at all times. If he doesn't finish his food within 15 minutes, pick up and remove the rest.\nVery small breeds often get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They should be fed four smaller meals spaced out to make sure their sugar levels are healthy throughout the day.\n\n, He'll need a few weeks to adjust to the schedule, so expect accidents at first. But as the puppy grows up, he'll be able to go for longer periods between bathroom sessions.\n\n\nPuppies 6-8 weeks old need to use the bathroom every hour during the day until they're housebroken. At night, you should let them out every 2-4 hours.\nPuppies 8-16 weeks old should be able to hold it for about two hours during the day and four hours at night.\n\n, Even when they're as young as eight weeks old, some puppies will sleep for a full eight hours during the night. Most, though, will need to use the bathroom at least once during the night. Do this 2-4 hours after putting your dog to bed.\n\n\nIt\u2019s best to let the dog out every two hours the first night or two, just in case.\nBegin increasing the time between wake-ups from every two hours to every four hours over several days or weeks. This will depend on the breed and how much your puppy sleeps. \u2014 Use your discretion.\nDaytime napping is important for puppies, but if you let him nap all day, he won't sleep at night!\n\n, During play, he'll learn that he's not allowed to bite or scratch, while working off his meals and growing strong and healthy. It also wears him out so he won't have excess energy that keeps him awake during scheduled nap or sleep times. A regular play schedule will keep him on his sleep schedule.\n\n\nTraining sessions should be fun enough for the puppy to count as play-time!\nKeep your puppy safe while he plays. Help him avoid things like falling, getting stuck, or eating\/chewing on things he shouldn\u2019t.\n\n, Crate training is the first step in potty training. Choose a crate with enough room for your dog to turn around comfortably. However, it shouldn't have so much room that he could use the bathroom in one corner and sleep in another. If your puppy learns to associate his crate with using the bathroom, he'll resist going into the crate to lay or sleep.\n\n\nIn the first few weeks, expect accidents in the crate even if it's the right size for the puppy. Don't lose your patience, though! He's still learning.\nIf your puppy is a larger breed, consider buying a crate with adjustable barriers that can be removed as the dog grows.\n\n, The den or family room is a good location for crate training. Leave the crate door open so the puppy can explore it at his own pace, and treat him whenever he goes into the crate.\n\n\nAfter he's grown used to the crate, start closing the door and leaving him in it for longer periods of time. Crate him at night and anytime you aren\u2019t home or able to watch him.\nYou can move the crate between rooms, bringing it into the bedroom with you at night, for example. But always make sure it's somewhere your dog feels safe.\n\n, If he associates going to the bathroom with a very specific place, he'll be less likely to have accidents in other places. It'll also make clean-up easier in the future because you'll know where he likes to go.\n\n, Minimize how much time he plays outside during the first 2-4 weeks of potty training. Playing with the dog outside in the middle of his potty training will confuse him about what he should do when he goes outside. When he's mastered potty-training, you can start spending more playtime outside with him.\n\n, \"Bathroom\" or \"Go potty\" are examples. When you take him outside, use that same phrase and the same tone of voice every time he goes to the bathroom. If your puppy uses the bathroom after you give the command, praise him with a lot of excitement and a treat.\n\n\nYou might also choose a separate command specific to encouraging your dog to defecate. Young puppies need to defecate more often, so teaching a dog to associate a specific command with defecating can be useful.\n\n, This isn't a punishment, but a training tool. If your puppy doesn\u2019t use the bathroom within a few minutes of you giving the command, put him in his crate for 5-10 minutes. The dog may whine or cry when confined to the crate, but don\u2019t let them out.\u2013It will confuse the learning process.\n\n\nAfter 5-10 minutes have passed, take him back outside to use the bathroom and give the command again.\nRepeat the process until he makes an attempt to use the bathroom after you give the command.\nWhen he finally uses the bathroom, repeat the command and reward him with lots of praise and a treat, then let him back into the house to play.\n\n, Hang the bell by the door you use each time you take the dog out. It should hang low enough for your puppy to reach with his paw or nose. Use the bell only with a single door at first. You can move the bell or add more bells at other doors once the puppy understands how the bell system works.\n\n\nVery small breed dogs and very young puppies may not be able to hold it long enough to reach the door that leads outside. In that case, hang the bell wherever the dog spends the most time \u2014 the living room, for example. You can move the bell to the outside door when the puppy can hold it a little longer.\nIt helps to keep the dog\u2019s living area small during the stage until potty training is well established. You might use a puppy gate and attach a bell to it.\n\n, Hold out treats near the bell, and ring it when the dog comes to retrieve the treats. You might smear a little cheese or some other treat on the bell, and, when the dog touches the bell, reward him with an additional treat. Repeat this process until the dog knows to associate the bell with reward.\n\n, Always open the door immediately after any hint of the bell ringing, and give lots of praise. There are a few different ways to train your puppy to ring the bell:\n\n\nWithout ringing the bell yourself, tap your fingers on the wall or door next to it, and say \"Outside.\" Your puppy should learn to jump up to your fingers, ringing the bell in the process.\nHold a treat just behind the bell, and say \"Outside.\" The puppy\u2019s nose will ring the bell when he goes for the treat.\nPhysically take your puppy\u2019s paw, hit the bell with it, and say \"Outside.\"\nSkip the bell training if you\u2019re rushing out for a bathroom emergency. Only use the bell with scheduled bathroom breaks.\n\n, Your puppy is very smart, and has a great sense of cause and effect. Anything he observes before the door opening\/praise\/treat will be seen as a cause of the desired effect. If you let variation creep into what your dog experiences before the door opens, he can become confused. Make it easy for him to learn what he needs to do to be let out. Keep it simple. For example, only use one of the methods outlined in the previous step \u2014 don't mix and match.\n\n, You can either move the bell to different doors or hang a different bell by each exterior door. When you travel, take a bell with you so the dog can use it while on the road. Similarly, send the bell with your dog if he stays at another home while you\u2019re away on a trip. If you need to find a new home for your dog, let the new owners know he's bell trained, and encourage them to make a bell available at the new home.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":596}

After each player takes their final turn and counts up their score, Scrooge has 17 points and Marley has 12. Because Scrooge didn't win the round by getting the lowest score, Scrooge is punished for knocking and adds Marley's 12 points to his own. The final scores are Scrooge 29 and Marley 12.\n\n\n\n, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 4x2 or 5x2 grid.\n\n\nThis will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).\n\n, Follow the rules for 4-card golf, but give each player a hand of four cards instead of a grid.\n\n\nPlayers can look at all cards in their hand at any time.\nAny two cards in hand cancel out if they have the same value. There is no \"grid position\" in your hand.\nThis creates a short simple game with no need to memorize cards.\n\n, Follow the rules for 6-card golf, but give each player a 3x3 grid.\n\n\nEach player turns up 3 cards instead of 2 at the start of the game.\nA player can only cancel cards by getting 3 of a kind in the same row or column. When they do, they can remove those 3 cards and place them at the bottom (NOT the top) of the discard pile.\nThis will make the game quite a bit longer and may require an additional deck of cards shuffled with the other(s).\n\n, There are many different ways to play 6-card golf, and different families and gaming groups will have their own rules. Here are some common ones:\n\n\nWhen you flip over your first two cards, they have to be in the same column, or they must be in different columns.Two of the same card anywhere on the layout cancel out, not just in the same column. This makes the game easier for younger players or beginners.If you have two columns next to each other with FOUR of the same card in them, they cancel out to zero points AND each other player gets 10 points added to their score this round.Players can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns, not the discard pile.\n\n, Again, there are many ways to play. Here are some common additions or changes to the rules:\n\n\nYou can only peek at the two cards closest to you.\nPairs across from each other diagonally also cancel out.\nPairs don't cancel out at all. The only goal is to take the lowest cards and try to end the game when you think you're ahead.\nPlayers can only draw from the top of the draw pile during the final turns.\n\n, If you're playing a variation that allows you to start with face up cards, choose cards in different columns. This gives you more chances to \"cancel\" out a column.\n\n, Unless you can cancel out your high scoring cards, you want to get rid of them so they don't add their high values to your score.\n\n\nThis is especially important as the game draws to a close. If your opponent is almost out of face down cards (or is looking smug), toss out your liabilities as quickly as possible!\n\n, Much of the strategy in Golf comes down to paying attention to the other players.If the player to your right is picking up Sixes, you should give up trying to cancel your own Sixes. They aren't likely to discard any.\nIf the player to your left is trying to finish a column of Nines, try to avoid discarding your own Nine.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":599}

{"text":" You will need evidence if you want to bring a lawsuit for assault. One important piece of evidence is the police report, if there is one. You may have been given a copy of the police report after talking to the police. Alternately, you might need to contact the police station.See Obtain a Police Report for more information.;\n, You should try to identify witnesses who observed the assault. The police report should identify any witnesses if you didn\u2019t know anyone personally.You want to talk to them because they could serve as witnesses in your lawsuit.\n\n\nAsk what they saw. Ideally, they saw the defendant make a threatening gesture towards you.\nGet their names and also a written statement, if possible.\nAlso find personal contact information, such as a phone number or email address. You will want to stay in contact with them as the trial approaches.\n\n, You are also an important witness to the assault. In particular, only you can testify that you felt you were in danger of being struck. As soon as possible, sit down and write down the circumstances surrounding the encounter.\n\n\nAlso explain if you felt startled. Technically, you don\u2019t need to experience any particular reaction in order to sue for assault. However, your case will be stronger if you were shocked or experienced some other intense emotion, like fear.\n\n, You can be compensated for any physical injury.If the defendant actually struck you, then you can sue for \u201cassault and battery.\u201d Medical records are good proof of the injury you suffered.\n\n\nYou should also take color photographs of any bruises, cuts, nicks, scrapes, or stitches.\n\n, You might also be able to get compensated for emotional distress caused by the assault.You can document your emotional distress by keeping a journal in which you write down daily how you are feeling.\n\n\nIf you were prescribed medication to take, then you should also save those orange bottles. You can be compensated for any medicine you buy. Prescription drugs also serve as proof of injury.\n\n, You can also get compensated for lost income if you are unable to continue working as a result of the assault.You should find the following, which will help show how much money you have lost:\n\n\npaystubs\nW-2 form\nproof of self-employed income\ntax returns\n\n, You will probably benefit from consulting with a lawyer about your lawsuit. A lawyer can help you think through what evidence you will need to bring a successful lawsuit. A lawyer can also analyze your situation and tell you whether you have a strong case.\n\n\nTo Choose a Personal Injury Lawyer, start by asking your family and friends for recommendations. Lawyers rely on their clients to refer others, so this is a great way to find trustworthy lawyers.\nYou can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.Call up the lawyer and ask to schedule a consultation. Also ask how much the consultation will cost.\n\n, Each state has a \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d which is the maximum amount of time you get to bring a lawsuit. The amount of time will differ by state. It is incredibly important to recognize the time constraints and file before the statute of limitations expires. In your situation, because you are suing a parolee, you may be cutting it really close. In some circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled (i.e., suspended) for a period of time.\n\nFor example, in California, the statute of limitations might be tolled when a defendant is in prison. When the offender gets out of prison, the statute of limitations will begin to run again.\nTherefore, in a state like California, you may get longer than the normal two years to file your personal injury suit against the offender., Before suing, you should confirm that you actually have a legal case for assault. Assault is defined as someone intentionally creating a reasonable apprehension that you will suffer harmful or offensive contact.If someone raised their fist to strike you, then they probably have committed an assault\u2014provided you saw them make the action and felt in immediate danger of being punched.\n\n\nThe defendant doesn\u2019t need to actually touch you in order to assault you. It is the belief that you are about to be harmed that is the injury.\nHowever, assault cannot consist of only threatening words.Someone has not assaulted you by sending a Tweet that states \u201cI am going to punch you\u201d or by shouting at you that they want to hurt you.\nAlso consider your injury. You can sue for assault, even where you haven\u2019t suffered physical injury or emotional distress. However, you won\u2019t recover much money, which could make the entire lawsuit a waste of time.\n\n, In order to collect money damages in a suit against a parolee for injuries caused by them, you must have suffered some quantifiable harm. Work with your lawyer to determine how much this might be. In general, the court will award damages for economic harm and non-economic harm.\n\nEconomic damages are verifiable losses for things like medical expenses, property damages, and lost earnings. These damages can usually be determined by using receipts and bills.\nNon-economic damages are more subjective losses for things like pain and suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss of enjoyment. These damages are usually calculated by multiplying your economic damages by a number between 1.5 and 5 depending on the severity of the harm., Punitive damages are meant to punish.Usually, they are awarded for intentional, highly-offensive conduct. Because assault is intentional, you might qualify for punitive damages.\n\n\nNot every state allows punitive damages, so you should specifically ask your lawyer if your state does.\n\n, You should also report the assault to the parolee\u2019s officer, since they need to know whether the parolee has violated the law. You can find a parole officer by calling the probation department in your county.\n\n\nThe police should also bring the assault to the attention of the prosecutor. If not, you should report the assault to the police if you haven\u2019t already done so.\n\n, Restitution is a court ordered penalty requiring the offender to pay you an amount of money that begins to cover your losses stemming from a crime. Restitution will generally cover medical and dental costs, mental health counseling, funeral costs, income loss, relocation expenses, security system expenses, attorney fees, and potential future losses.\n\nRestitution is set, by a judge, at the time the offender is sentenced., As soon as you can, contact the district attorney and ask whether restitution is available in your particular case. Chances are, if you suffered a financial harm as a direct result of the offender's assault, you will be eligible. DAs may even proactively send you restitution forms to fill out.\n\nThe DA often has a very short window to present your restitution case to the judge. Therefore, it is very important that you fill out forms and\/or talk to the DA as soon as possible after the offender is charged., The DA, during sentencing, will be asked to provide evidence of your injuries so a definite restitution amount can be determined by the court. Therefore, it is important that you hand over all the evidence you have about the injuries you sustained and the financial harm it cost you. This paperwork will be the same type of paperwork that you have been collecting for your civil case. For example, you should gather and hand over the following types of documents:Bills (hospital, dental, funeral, etc.)\nReceipts\nExpenses\nInsurance information\n\n, Once the judge imposes restitution on the offender, your state's department of corrections, and potentially other agencies, will help you collect. While the offender is in prison, money will be taken out of their trust account as it comes in. Generally, the corrections department will be able to take up to 50% of the money offenders receive. That money will then be transferred to you.\n\nOnce the offender leaves prison, your information is automatically forwarded to your state's taxing agency. That agency will work to collect on your behalf through the use of wage garnishments, bank liens, and payment plans.\nIf you are not getting paid, you can file a civil lawsuit and, as a part of your larger case, ask the court to submit a court order requiring the offender to pay.\nRestitution orders will never expire, even if the offender files for bankruptcy, so you can continue to collect until you have been paid in full., You can\u2019t just sue someone anywhere. Instead, you can typically sue them in the county where they live. This may be the same county that you live in.\n\n\nIf the parolee lives in a distant county or in another state, then you need to consider this fact as part of your calculation as to whether you should sue. Talk about it with your lawyer.\nAlso think about whether you want to sue in small claims court. These courts are set up so that people can bring lawsuits without a lawyer\u2019s help. Generally, there is a maximum amount you can sue for in small claims court.Check with the court clerk.\n\n, You start a lawsuit by filing a \u201ccomplaint\u201d in court. This document identifies you as the person suing (the \u201cplaintiff\u201d) and the person who assaulted you as the \u201cdefendant.\u201d In many courts, there are printed, \u201cfill in the blank\u201d complaint forms you can use. Check the court\u2019s website or with the clerk. Your complaint should contain the following:\n\n\nA description of the factual circumstances surrounding the assault.Make sure to mention the elements of assault\u2014that the defendant\u2019s action was intended to create a reasonable apprehension of harmful or offensive contact.A claim that the assault injured you in some way. The apprehension of offensive or harmful contact is itself an injury, but mention all injuries, including emotional distress.\nA request for money compensation, including punitive damages if they are available.\nWhether you want a jury (available in some small claims courts).\nYour signature.\n\n, When you finish the complaint, make a copy for your records. Then take the completed complaint and your copies to the court clerk. Ask to file the original. Depending on your court, you may need to file copies as well.\n\n\nYou probably have to pay a filing fee. Ask the clerk for the amount and what methods of payment are acceptable.\nIf you can\u2019t afford the filing fee, ask for a fee waiver.\n\n, You have to give the defendant a chance to respond to your complaint. For this reason, you need to send them a copy of your complaint and a \u201csummons,\u201d which you can get from the court clerk.You generally can make service in one of the following ways:\n\n\nPay the sheriff or constable to make hand delivery on the defendant.\nHire a private process server to make hand delivery. You can find process servers listed in your phone book or online.\nHave someone 18 or older make hand delivery, provided they are not a party to the lawsuit.\nMail the complaint certified mail, return receipt requested. You can often mail the complaint if you sue in small claims court.\n\n, The defendant will probably file an \u201canswer.\u201d In this document, they will respond to each allegation that you made in your complaint.You should read the answer closely.\n\n\nThe defendant might file a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d instead. This document is a little different from an answer. Usually, a defendant will bring a motion to dismiss if you sued in the wrong court or didn\u2019t allege all of the elements of assault. There may be other reasons.If you receive a motion to dismiss and don\u2019t understand it, meet quickly with your attorney.\n\n, The defendant might not even respond to the lawsuit or might respond after the deadline. In either situation, you might be able to get a default judgment.Once you have a default judgment, you can try to get compensated for your injury.\n\n\nSee File a Motion for Default Judgment for additional information.\n\n, If you receive a response from the parolee, they will likely be contesting your petition. At this stage of the action, you will take part in discovery, which allows both sides to collect and exchange information in order to prepare for trial. During discovery you will collect facts, interview witnesses, find out what the other side is going to say, and figure out how strong your case is. In order to achieve these things, you will be able to use the following tools:Depositions, which are formal, in person interviews with parties and witnesses conducted under oath. The answers given can be used in court.\nInterrogatories, which are formal questions, posed in writing, that parties and witnesses are required to answer. The answers given can be used in court.\nRequests for documents, which are written requests asking the other party to give you certain documents. You might ask for things like text messages, email exchanges, and pictures.\nRequests for admission, which are written statements the other party is required to admit or deny. These statements help narrow the focus of litigation and determine what the true issues are.\n\n, When discovery concludes, the defendant is likely going to try and end the litigation by filing a motion for summary judgment. If successful, the judge will stop the case and immediately rule in the defendant's favor. To succeed, the defendant will have to persuade the judge that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In other words, the judge will rule in the defendant's favor, if, even if the judge makes every factual assumption in your favor, you would still lose.\n\nYou can defend against this motion by filing a response. Your response will include specific affidavits and pieces of evidence that tend to prove that factual disputes do exist. If you succeed, the litigation will continue., If you successfully defend yourself at the summary judgment stage, you should discuss a settlement with the defendant. Trials are incredibly expensive and time consuming and settling is a great way to avoid that. Ask the defendant to sit down with your lawyer and discuss a way to come to an agreement. If informal discussion fail, you might need to take part in some other alternative dispute resolution program.\n\nFor example, you might ask the defendant to take part in mediation. During mediation, a neutral third party will sit down with you and the defendant to discuss unique ways to settle the case. The mediator will not take sides and will not inject their own opinions.\nIf mediation fails, try non-binding arbitration. During arbitration, a judge-like third party will hear both sides of the case. After evidence has been presented, the arbitrator will draft a written opinion stating who they think should win, and how much they should be awarded.\n\n, As you approach trial, you should pull your evidence together. Identify the witnesses who you want to call, if any. Also get copies of documents you want to introduce. For example, if you have medical records, then you will want to introduce those into evidence.\n\n\nYour witnesses must have personal knowledge of what they are testifying about.For example, a witness who saw the defendant throw a punch at you can testify as to what they saw. However, the witness can\u2019t testify to gossip.\nYou will likely have to turn over a copy of all documents you intend to use as exhibits. You can make an exhibit by attaching an exhibit sticker to a corner of the document.\n\n, It is perfectly normal to be nervous about what will happen at trial. Ideally, you can prepare by sitting in on one. Check the court\u2019s calendar to see when a trial is being held. Make note of where the parties sit and how they talk to witnesses and the judge.\n\n, Right before the trial begins, you will be required to attend one final pretrial conference with the judge and defendant. During this conference, the judge will set the trial schedule, which includes what matters can be heard. It is your responsibility to tell the judge everything you plan on saying during trial. If you fail to do so, the judge may leave an important issue off of the trial schedule, which means you may not be able to bring it up., If you requested a jury, then you will pick the jury first. Then you will present your evidence to show that the defendant assaulted you. You can call your witnesses and testify on your own behalf.The defendant will get a chance to cross-examine all of your witnesses.\nAs you testify on cross-examination, remember to listen closely to the question asked and request clarification if necessary. Always remember to tell the truth., The defendant gets to present evidence second. Typically, you can ask every witness questions on cross-examination if you think it would be helpful.See Question Witnesses when Representing Yourself for more information.\n\n, If you had a jury, the judge will read the jury its instructions and then let them retire to deliberate.If you don\u2019t have a jury, then the judge should deliver a verdict from the bench.\n\n, Your work doesn\u2019t end with the verdict. If you win the lawsuit, you face the task of recovering monetary compensation from the defendant. Ideally, the defendant will just pay up. However, if they don\u2019t, then you might need to take other actions.\n\n\nIf you lost the lawsuit, you might want to consider filing an appeal.You start the appeal process by filing a Notice of Appeal with the trial court. You typically don\u2019t get much time\u2014usually 30 days or less after the verdict becomes final. You should talk with a lawyer about whether it is worthwhile to take an appeal.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":604}

{"text":" Black and brown are the most popular neutral colors. You can also try nude\/tan, white, and gray as well. Silver and gold are also both considered to be neutral, and are ideal for evening looks.\n\n\nPlan ahead. Avoid mixing contrasting colors, such as black booties and a white dress. This will \"cut\" your legs in half, and make them appear too short.;\n, The more slender your heel is, the more chic and sophisticated your outfit will look. A sleek, slender heel is also ideal if you want a more dressy look.\n\n, Shiny materials make things look bigger. Matte materials, such as leather, suede, or canvas, make things appear smaller., Ideally, the cuff of the boot should extend just past the ankle as well.You might also want to skip excessive details, such as heavy embellishment or lots of straps. These will only add bulk to your boots, and thus to the ankle area., These styles tend to be more comfortable than ones with high heels and pointed toes, especially after hours of walking. They are ideal for casual, day-time looks., The pointed toes and higher heels automatically make these styles look fancier than their casual counterparts. They are feminine, and great for elongating the leg. They are ideal for date nights where you won't be doing a lot of walking., Depending on what body shape you have, different boot styles will help balance your body out. Listed below are some ideas based on the four main body types:If you have a pear-shaped body, your hips are wider than your shoulders. Opt for a simple pair of ankle boots with a heel.\nIf you have an inverted triangle shape, your shoulders are wider than your hips. Try a pair of brightly colored boots. Heavily-embellished styles will also work. This will give the illusion of curvier legs.\nIf you have a rectangle body shape, your hips, wait, and shoulders are the same size. Try a pair of detailed boots, as this will give the illusion of curves.\nIf you have an apple body shape, your widest point will be your waist or torso. Opt for a pair of brightly colored or heavily-embellished boots. This will draw the attention away from your waist, and give the illusion of curves.\n\n, Much like body type, different boot styles will help balance things out like height, curves, or lack of curves. Listed below are some ideas based on different height and size combinations:If you are short and slim, go for heeled boots that cover the ankle. This will make your legs appear longer. Avoid boots that end at or below the ankle.\n\n, This will extend your legs, and give you a longer, sleeker look.\n\n\nIf you are tall and curve, skip the cuff details. Too much detailing along the cuff will draw too much attention to your calves, and make them appear thicker than they actually are. Instead, opt for plain cuffs.\nIf you are tall and slender, you can go with any style of boot.\n\n, Anything that ends about mid-thigh would be idea. The shorter your dress is, the longer your legs will appear. Long dresses (knee-length and loner) are generally not recommended for ankle boots, as they tend to shorten the leg.\n\n\nIf you must wear a longer dress, consider wearing some opaque tights that match the color of your boot. The ideal combination is black boots and black tights. This will make your legs appear longer.\n\n, Long dresses are generally not recommended for booties, because they tend to make the legs appear too short. You can resolve this by getting a dress whose hem ends just above the boot. If you want to wear a maxi-length dress, try one with a slit up the side.Both of these tricks will help keep your legs from looking too short or stumpy.\n\n\nTry pairing longer dresses with fancier boots that have slimmer heels and toes. Casual boots, with wide cuffs and chunky heels will look better with shorter dresses., This will allow your accessories (such as wide belts and layered boho necklaces) really shine through without making your outfit appear too cramped. The dress can have a pattern on it, if you'd like, but tone down the embellishments, such as beading and embroidery.\n\n, Bulky, heavy boots will \"weigh\" the dress down. Some embellishments, such as a simple strap, won't take away from the look, however., Depending on what sort of dress your wear with your booties, you can draw the focus away from certain areas, and direct it to others. Here are some tips based on different body types:If you are short and slim, try bubble skirts, rompers, and mini dresses. To make your legs appear longer, wear some opaque tights that match the color of your boot.\nIf you are petite and curvy, try an A-line dress that ends just above the knee if you are petite and curve. Avoid wearing dresses that end below the knee, as this will make your legs appear shorter.\nIf you are tall and curvy, try a long tunic-type dress or a semi-voluminous dress with dark tights. This will help make your legs appear more slender.\nIf you are tall and slender, try a dress that ends just above the knee.\n\n, Not all boot styles go well with all dresses. Creating contrast between boot and dress styles can make a boring outfit look more interesting. The wrong type of contrast, however, can make your outfit look clashy, and not in a good way. For example, thick, chunky booties won't look good with a lacy evening dress.Here are a few tips to keep in mind when putting your outfit together:Pair boots with pointed toes and slender heels with fancier dresses. Pair boots with rounded toes and flat or chunky heels with casual dresses.\nTry sleek dresses with boots that have sleek heels. If your dress is simple, then you can go wild with the accessories.\nTry cowboy styled boots with high-waisted dresses for that vintage feel.\n\n, Note any details on your boots, such as studs or beaded trim. Choose accessories, such as belts or jewelry, that match these details. If your boots are plain, look at the style of your dress instead.\n\n\nIf you are wearing simple, leather boots and a boho styled dress, try adding a wide, leather belt, some feather earrings, and a rustic necklace made from natural stones.\nIf you are wearing a simple dress with leather, studded boots, try adding a matching, studded leather belt, and some silver jewelry.\nLeather ankle boots, a sleeveless tribal patterned midi, a long necklace, and a fedora all look fabulous for a boho look.\n\n, Something as simple as a matching jacket can make a flirty, girlish outfit look more formal and business like. For example, a fit and flare dress with slender-heeled booties will give you a flirty and girlish look. Adding a jacket and\/or belt over the dress will immediately give you a more businesslike look., If your boots already have a lot of zippers, studs, or straps, you might want to keep the rest of your outfit looking simple. This also includes your dress. Instead, try a simple belt, scarf, or a pair of stud earrings.If your accessories and dress are too detailed as well, your entire outfit will look too busy.\n\n, A simple dress and boots are like a blank canvas. Try adding some longer earrings and a statement necklace. You can also play around with other accessories, such as a belt, bag, and hat or scarf. Try not to go overboard with your accessories however; if you add too many, your outfit will appear too cluttered.\n\n, Black tights and black booties are great for making your legs appear longer, but they won't make your outfit look very interesting. Patterned tights, however, will.Make sure that your patterned tights match your outfit somehow. For example, if your dress has roses on it, try tights made from lace with a rose design. If your boots have a chevron print on the cuff, try tights with a chevron weave.\n\n, For a more chic look, try a slim belt over a plain sheath dress with slender-heeled boots.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":607}

{"text":",\nNon-leap years will be referred to throughout the guide as \u201cnormal years.\u201d The Gregorian calendar repeats exactly every 400 years. Note that the Gregorian calendar has been reformed in the past and that this algorithm only applies to the Gregorian calendar in its most recent state. For more information on this reform and its consequences for calculating the day of the week, refer to the \u201cJulian calendar\u201d section of the Wikipedia article entitled \u201cDoomsday rule\u201d: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Doomsday_rule#Julian_calendar.\nIn this guide, the notation \u201cC.E.\u201d and \u201cB.C.E.\u201d will be used. \u201cC.E.\u201d means \u201cCommon Era\u201d and is equivalent to \u201cA.D.\u201d \u201cB.C.E.\u201d means \u201cBefore the Common Era\u201d and is equivalent to \u201cB.C.\u201d For more information refer to the Wikipedia article entitled \u201cCommon Era\u201d: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Common_Era. Think of C.E. years as positive and B.C.E. years as negative (but subtract one from them first). For example, think of 1670 C.E. as 1670, but think of 1540 B.C.E. as -1539. Note that there is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar, so you must subtract 1 from 1540 before placing a negative sign in front of it. For a more detailed explanation, see the Wikipedia article entitled \u201cAstronomical year numbering\u201d: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Astronomical_year_numbering.\nIn this guide, the formats mm\/dd and mm\/dd\/yyyy will be used to represent dates in compact form. For example, 8\/6 is equivalent to August 6th, 7\/24\/1670 is equivalent to July 24th, 1670 C.E., 12\/6\/534 is equivalent to December 6th, 534 C.E., and 10\/23\/-1889 is equivalent to October 23rd, 1890 B.C.E.\n\n, April, June, September, and November have 30 days. February has 28 days during a normal year and 29 days during a leap year. Leap day, that is, the day that only exists during a leap year, is February 29. There is a useful mnemonic to distinguish between months with 31 days and fewer than 31 days. Hold out your right hand. Tap the knuckle of your index finger and say \u201cJanuary.\u201d Tap the gap\/dip\/valley between the knuckles of your index and middle fingers and say \u201cFebruary.\u201d You can remember that January has more days than February because your knuckle is taller than the gap. Next tap the knuckle of your middle finger and say \u201cMarch.\u201d Notice as you continue that all of the months with 31 days are on knuckles, while all of the months with fewer days are in gaps. You\u2019re probably wondering: \u201cWhat do I do once I get to July?\u201d because July is on the knuckle of your pinky. Just go back to the beginning; tap the knuckle of your index finger again and say \u201cAugust.\u201d Continue from here to get to the rest of the months.\n\n, Here are some easy-to-remember Doomsdays: 4\/4, 8\/8, 10\/10, 12\/12, 5\/9, 9\/5, 7\/11, and 11\/7. A mnemonic for the last four Doomsdays in the list is: \u201c9 to 5 job at a 7-11 gas station.\u201d For example, in the year 2000, April 4, June 6, July 11, and November 7 are all Tuesdays. (Important note: this does not mean that April 4, 2001 was also Tuesday. April 4, 2001 was actually a Wednesday.) You can add or subtract 7 from any Doomsday to get another Doomsday. For example, 5\/9, 5\/16, and 5\/23 are all Doomsdays. You don\u2019t have to just add or subtract 7 at a time though; you can use any multiple of 7. For example, 9\/5 and 9\/26 are both Doomsdays, because 5+7*3 \u2261 26. Another easy-to-remember Doomsday is 3\/0. No this is not a typo; 3\/0 is simply another way of thinking about the last day of February. Unlike 2\/28 or 2\/29, 3\/0 is always the last day of February, regardless of whether or not it is a leap year. The world can even think of months as having negative days. For example, 8\/8 and 8\/-6 are both Doomsdays. To convert 8\/-6 into a normal date, simply add the number of days in the 7th month (August). Use the knuckle trick from the previous paragraph to determine that there are 31 days in August. So, 8\/-6 is the same as 7\/25, because -6+31 \u2261 25. We may also think of months as having days greater than 31. For example, 10\/10 and 10\/34 are both Doomsdays. To convert 10\/34 into a normal date, simply subtract the number of days in the 10th month (October). Our knuckles tell us that October has 31 days, so 10\/34 is 11\/3, because 34-31 \u2261 3. We can even write June days as March days. For example, 6\/6 and 6\/-64 are Doomsdays. May (month 5) has 31 days, so 6\/-64 \u2261 5\/-33. April (month 4) has 30 days, so 5\/-33 \u2261 4\/-3. March (month 3) has 31 days, so 4\/-3 \u2261 3\/28. Thus, June -64th is equivalent to March 28th, which is a Doomsday. Be careful to account for leap years when using these tricks to determine Doomsdays in January or February. For example, in ANY year, 3\/0 and 3\/-14 are both Doomsdays, but in a leap year February has 29 days, so 3\/-14 \u2261 2\/15, while in a normal year February has 28 days, so 3\/-14 \u2261 2\/14. Thus, February 15th is a Doomsday during leap years, but February 14th is a Doomsday during normal years. You have to be careful when going from March to January as well. Leap year: 3\/-42 \u2261 2\/-13 \u2261 1\/18; normal year: 3\/-42 \u2261 2\/-14 \u2261 1\/17.\n\n,\nSunday \u2261 NONEday \u2261 0\nMonday \u2261 ONEday \u2261 1\nTuesday \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2\nWednesday \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 3 (lame, I know)\nThursday \u2261 FOUR\u2019Sday \u2261 4\nFriday \u2261 FIVEday \u2261 5\nSaturday \u2261 SIXAday \u2261 6\nSunday \u2261 SE\u2019ENday \u2261 7 (\u201cse\u2019en\u201d as in a contraction for \u201cseven\u201d that sounds like \u201csun\u201d)\nBecause there are seven days in a week, you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 at ANY point during ANY part of ANY day-of-the-week calculation. This is why Sunday is both 0 and 7. Monday could be thought of as -6, 8, 71, etc. Throughout the guide you will see (and have been seeing) congruence symbols, \u2261, rather than equals signs, =, because 71 does NOT equal 8, but they are equivalent for the purpose of determining the day of the week. While finding a day of the week we are only interested in the remainder when numbers are divided by 7. All of these congruence are thus \u201cmodulo 7,\u201d abbreviated \u201cmod 7.\u201d Numbers are congruent modulo 7 if their remainders are the same when they are divided by 7. This is equivalent to the earlier point that you can add or subtract multiples of 7 as you wish. For example, 1 \u2260 8, but 1 \u2261 8 (mod 7). More examples of the way in which modulo behave are -15 \u2261 -1 \u2261 6 (mod 7) and 4 \u2261 -3 \u2261 7004 (mod 7). The notation \u201c(mod 7)\u201d will be left off throughout the guide, because all congruences are assumed to be modulo 7.\nIf you know that August 8, 1953 is a Saturday, then you can quickly determine that August 4, 1953 is a Tuesday, because four days before SIXAday is TWO\u2019Sday. That is, 6-4 \u2261 2. Likewise, if you know that 9\/5\/1776 is a FOUR\u2019Sday, then you can quickly see that 9\/7\/1776 is a SIXAday, because 7-5 \u2261 2 and 4+2 \u2261 6. Remember that you can add or subtract any multiple of 7 to a Number-day. If you know that 10\/10\/-2543 is a SIXAday, then you can quickly determine that 10\/2\/-2543 is a FIVEday, because 2-10 \u2261 -8 \u2261 -8+7 \u2261 -1, and 6+(-1) \u2261 5. Once again, remember to watch out for leap years, like 18,400. If you know that 2\/28\/18,400 is a ONEday, then you can quickly determine that 3\/3\/18,400 is a FIVEday, because 2\/28\/18,400 \u2261 3\/-1\/18,400 and 3-(-1) \u2261 4 and 1+4 \u2261 5.\n\n, For example, every Doomsday in 2009 is a Saturday, so the Year-day of 2009 is Saturday. The \u201cCentury-day\u201d of any given century is the \u201cYear-day\u201d of the first year of the century. The \u201cCentury-year\u201d is the first year of any given century. The Year-day of 1900 is Wednesday, so the Century-day of the 1900s (i.e. the 20th century) is Wednesday. Also, 1900 is the Century-year of the 20th century. Note though, that the Century-year of the century that -1362 lies in (i.e. the -1300s or the 14th century B.C.E.) is -1400, NOT -1300, because -1400 comes before -1300. Remember also that -1400 is equivalent to 1401 B.C.E., NOT 1400 B.C.E.\n\n, These Year-days are called \u201cBig Tuesdays\u201d (just to help you remember them). Years that are divisible by 400 are called \u201cBig Tuesday-years,\u201d and centuries that have Century-days that are also Big Tuesdays are called \u201cBig Tuesday-centuries.\u201d Thus, the Year-day of 1600 is a Big Tuesday. The Century-days of the 2000s, the -4400s, and the 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesdays, the 2000s, the -4400s, and 96,812,000s are all Big Tuesday-centuries, and 2000, -4400, and 96,812,000 are all Big Tuesday-years.\n\n, Subtract 100 from the Century-year until you get to a Big Tuesday-year. Count how many times you subtracted 100. If you subtracted 100 once, then the Century-day is Sunday; if twice, then it\u2019s Friday; if thrice, then it\u2019s Wednesday; if four or more times, then you messed up, because one of every four Century-years is a Big Tuesday-year. For example, the Century-day of the 1800s is Friday, because you subtract 100 twice to get 1600, which is a Big Tuesday-year (because it\u2019s divisible by 400). The pattern looks like this: 1600 \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2, 1700 \u2261 SUNday \u2261 0, 1800 \u2261 FIVEday \u2261 5 \u2261 -2, 1900 \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 3 \u2261 -4, 2000 \u2261 TWO\u2019Sday \u2261 2 \u2261 -5, and so on. Note that you can get from one Century-day day to the next by subtracting two from the initial Century-day. This only works when the larger of the two adjacent centuries is not a Big Tuesday-century. That\u2019s fine though, because you already know that the Century-day of every Big Tuesday-century is TWO\u2019Sday.\n\n, The \u201cDozen-day\u201d of any given year is the Year-day of the Dozen-year. The Dozen-day can be calculated by adding the Century-day to the result of the division by 12. For example, the Dozen-year of 1234 is 1224, because 1224-1200 \u2261 24 \u2261 12*2, and no larger years that are still less than or equal to 1234 yield a positive difference with 1200 that is divisible by 12. Since the Year-day of 1224 is Thursday, the Dozen-day of 1234 is also Thursday. Note that the Dozen-days for 1235, 1226, and 1229 are all Thursdays as well; while the Dozen-days for 1236 and 1238 are not the same (they are, in fact, Fridays). For another example, we can calculate the Dozen-day of -1713. We first need to find the Century-day of the -1700s. Since we must subtract 100 three times from -1700 to arrive at a Big Tuesday-year, the Century-day is THREE\u2019Sday. Next we must find the Dozen-year. Note that the Dozen-year is not -1712, but rather -1716, because -1716-(-1800) = 84 = 12*7. So, the Dozen-day of -1713 is 3+7 \u2261 3 \u2261 THREE\u2019Sday (since we can subtract 7 as we please).\n\n, The \u201cQuad-day\u201d of any given year is the Year-day of the Quad-year. For example, the Quad-year of 1620 is 1620; while that of 1643 is 1640. The Quad-days of 1640, 1641, 1642, and 1643 are all Wednesday; while the Quad-day of 1620 is Saturday. We can calculate the Quad-day as follows. If the given year is 1642, then the Dozen-year is 1636, because 1636-1600 \u2261 12*3. The Century-year, 1600, is a Big TWO\u2019Sday. 3+2 \u2261 5, so the Dozen-day of 1642 is FIVEday. Subtract 4 from the Quad-year, 1640, until you get to the Dozen-year. Multiply the number of times you subtracted 4 by -2, and add this result to the Dozen-day to get the Quad-day. In our example, 1640-4*1 \u2261 1636, 1*-2 \u2261 -2, and 5+(-2) \u2261 3, so the Quad-day of 1642 is Wednesday (as mentioned previously). Wednesday, is thus also the Year-day of 1640.\n\n, Add the result to the Quad-day to get the Year-day. In our example, 1642-1640 \u2261 2, and 2+THREE\u2019Sday \u2261 FIVEday, so the Year-day of 1642 is Friday.\n\n, For example, if the date were 9\/5\/1642, you would already know that it was a Friday. If the date were 6\/20\/1642, then you would subtract 7 days twice to discover that 6\/20\/1642 is the same day of the week as 6\/6\/1642, which is a known Doomsday. This means that 6\/20\/1642 is also a Doomsday, and is therefore a Friday.\n\n, We know 4\/4\/1642 is a Doomsday, so we add 14 days to discover that 4\/18\/1642 is a Doomsday. Now we know that 4\/18\/1642 is a FIVEday, so we simply add 2 days to find that 4\/20\/1642 is a SE\u2019ENday. Don\u2019t forget that the nearest known Doomsday may not be in the same month. For example, 3\/29\/1642 is closer to 4\/4\/1642 than to 3\/0\/1642. Since 4\/4\/1642 \u2261 4\/-3\/1642 \u2261 3\/28\/1642, we know that 3\/29\/1642 \u2261 FIVEday + 1 \u2261 SIXAday.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":609}

{"text":" You don't need to have the wigs or the rugs, though. If it is a hair salon, you only need the items for your hair. Since they are all gone, you may need to trade for them. Just yell out in Jamaa Township: \"Does anyone have any salon den items? If so, I'd love to trade for them!\" If all else fails, you don't need spa items. Use an inflatable pool (make it white, I use a white pig pool and it's awesome.) for a hot tub. If you are using the beach den skip this step because it already has a pool. You could use a mirror that you can find at Outback Imports as a substitute for a vanity. Get creative!;\n, You need it to look good so people don't leave. Try adding some plants music, wallpaper, flooring, and some sort of rug. Everything should match. It should be wide and spacious. If you don't have a big enough den to fit all of your decorations in, you could use multiple small dens, but that would require a LOT of switching dens, so that isn't recommended. Nice music attracts customers and keeps them occupied in the waiting room, more about that on step 4. Wallpapers with different colors, like the pink striped wallpaper, look good. Avoid the rainbow wallpaper. Stick with wooden floors (beta wooden floor, wooden tiles, and wooden planks that come with the small den.) and don't have anything crazy, so avoid the grass floor.\n\n, You can add them in and tell customers to take one after they leave your salon! Like in step 1, it's a spa item, so you may need to trade for it. You could buy a fancy coffee table from Epic Wonders and put some books on it (or put a bookshelf next to it.), but you may need to trade for the books too. You may need to advertise your salon too, so that's why the customers need the magazines.\n\n, Add couches and things to play with so your customers don't get bored and leave your salon. If you are using a separate den for the waiting room, be sure that there is a bunch of stations in the actual salon, because people will get annoyed going back and forth from one den to another. You should have nice music in the waiting room den to keep customers happy.\n\n, You could also hire someone to greet the customers when they come in. If you'd like, add a welcome mat to the front. If you have a door in the front, make sure to open it so people can come in. If you have a greeter, be sure to check on them once in a while. If the greeter has to get off, put some couches next to the entrance so people cat sit while they wait to come in., Just say \"Ok\" and politely tell them to leave. If they don't leave, tell them you are going to lock them out and lock them out. Before you let everyone in, buddy them so you don't have to do it when you lock them out, or else it might just be an awkward moment of silence. It is also important to because they might report you while everyone is buddying you., If they don't, then lock them out or report them. If other people get jealous and go to the front of the line, lock them out too. Tell the remaining customers that everyone should not cut to the front of the line and wait politely. DO NOT TYPE LIKE THIS!! IT WILL GET CUSTOMERS MAD AND THEY WILL REPORT YOU!!!, Try and have a nice conversation with the \"nice\" customers. Who knows, you may host the salon lonely and come out being popular with your buddy list full!, You get tips by being nice to customers, providing a wide variety of services, and having your salon in tip-top shape, like in the step above. Don't be greedy and ask for tips, because it gives you a bad reputation. People in Animal Jam usually have a bad temper, so you could easily start a huge fight and all your customers will be yelling at you!, If they say no, kindly warn them they will be locked out and reported. If they stop, don't do it. If they do, then lock them out or report hem., If they ask for something that you don't provide, kindly tell them you don't provide it. If they yell at you or lose their temper, block 'em and lock 'em. If they ask for something you do provide (for example: the full treatment) then do the full treatment., Make sure to rinse it out and let it dry. Then brush their fur to rid it of any ratty areas. If they want, do their hair. Keep some hairspray by., They will most likely change their fur color. Ask them what color they want. If they reply saying \"This is the wrong color!\" or \"It's ruined!\" ask them specifically what color they want (for example: the purple on the top left) and you should be able to know what color they want. If they like it, then smile and compliment them by saying \"That color looks good on you!\" or \"You look stunning!\"., If they are a member, gift it to them. If they are a nonmember, ask if they can put something on trade and trade it to them. What accessories do they want? Ask them. It's always nice to get things, but it's even nicer to give things. If they want a head flower, give them a head flower that looks good with their outfit. Before you give it to them, put it on your animal and ask them \"Do you want this?\" just to make sure. If not, recycle it and get something they'd like. If they do, give it to them and compliment them by saying \"That really matches!\" or \"That looks good with your dress!\", Ask them which color they want and start painting. If they want a pattern, pretend to go get nail stencils ans ask them what color they want their pattern to be. Get that color and do your magic! Do a special marble effect, add cute little nail decals, and cut their nails! They'll adore their new fancy nails., Ask them which color and then apply the makeup on them. Do they want lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow? Do they want green contacts to match their green nails? Do it for them! For the girly girl, pink shades are their best friend. If your customer isn't the \"girly girl\" type, some blues, greens, or browns would look great on them. Be sure to avoid turning your customer into a clown- remember, not too much makeup! Ask them what makeup they can wear to make sure they aren't allergic to what you are using., Welcome them in your salon. Then let the look around top see the things they can do. Offer them some jobs that they might like doing. They will say something from the list down below:\n\nGreeting the customers sounds fun!\nI'd love to advertise your salon and give away magazines!\nEntertaining people in the waiting room suits me.\n\n, Tell them the things from \"Operating the Salon\" above. Check on them every once in a while to make sure they are doing their job. If they are doing it correctly, everyone should be happy and satisfied! Be sure to share your earnings with the employees so they don't quit., Give them breaks and let them chat for a while when they are not needed (for example: nobody is coming to the salon so the greeter doesn't need to greet people.). Provide food for the employees when they are on their break., Add some pizazz in and say \"Salon my den! It's epic!\". Just adding \"It's epic!\" makes jammers think it really is. Add things like \"It's huge\", \"It's about to get full\", \"Hurry before I leave\", \"Very spacious\", and \"It has good reviews\". Just remember whatever you say, people believe you. Ever wonder why people get scammed? It's because they believe what people say!, That's one of the worst and most annoying problems in Animal Jam. Why? Because most of the time, people who lock their den are trolling other people to click on their name tag for nothing. Make sure to keep your den unlocked so nobody thinks you are trolling them., That's also very annoying. Why? Same as above! You see an awesome salon being advertised, but the person advertising it is moving around like crazy or their name tag is covered by the crowds of Jamaa, so either way, you can't click! So annoying..., Your den will most likely be full. But, it may be super laggy and hard to type and hard for people to click your name tag. Instead of going into a full world, go into a world that has 3 green dots or 2 green dots. A better way to solve this is to go from world to world gathering jammers. Since spas are so rare in AJ, your den should be full in a few minutes (if people don't keep leaving, darn jammers!).","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":612}

{"text":" In order to practice pyrography, you'll want a few basic tools to get you started. After you've successfully completed a couple of drawings, you may want to expand, although you're be perfectly able to get by with the following:\n\n\nWood burning pen. These basically come in two varieties: the 'every-man's' soldering iron style machine with one heat setting as well as interchangeable brass tips, and the higher-end wire pen with two styluses and different heat settings. You can get a decent soldering iron style pen for $20+, while the more versatile wire pens sell for hundreds of dollars.Assorted wood burning tips. These will allow you greater leeway to produce lighter\/heavier marks, as well as different patterns.\nStrop and aluminum oxide to periodically clean off the brass tips of the wood burning pen.\nPliers.\nClay pot or pen holder (for safety when element is still hot).;\n, The hardness of wood is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the softest wood (like Balsa) and 10 being the hardest (like Padauk). For beginners, especially, the softer the wood, the better. Hard woods are expensive, resistant to heat, and generally on the darker side. Soft woods, on the other hand, are cheaper, easier to burn, and lighter, providing a good burn contrast. Try getting your hands on these soft woods as you start off wood burning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPine\nBasswood\nBirch\nAsh\nMaple\n\n, Your pen will get quite hot quite fast, so attach the tip you'll be working with before you turn on the machine. Always attach and detach tips with your pliers. Give your pen two or so minutes to get hot. As it heats up, let your wood burning pen rest in a pen holding device or a clay pot to minimize the risk of accidental burning.\n\n, Take some 320 grit sandpaper, wrap it around a flat wooden block or attach to a paddle sander, and lightly hit all areas of the wood equally. Details will come out sharper and crisper when the surface of the wood is very smooth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen sanding, sand with the grain. The grain is the direction of the wood fibers. Sanding with the grain will minimize any tiny burrs or scratch marks that result from sanding against the grain.\nWhen you're done sanding, wipe the surface with a damp towel. This will remove any sawdust and make the outline transfer easier.\n\n, Many beginners make the mistake of pressing down too hard on the wood with the pen, thinking that lots of pressure is needed to make an impression. It's not. In fact, using light strokes is preferable to pressing down hard. It's easier to guide the pen, reduces errors, and all but eliminates the possibility of accidental burning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You're not going to win any awards for racing through the design in record time. Wood burning, regardless of the material you're using, is a slow process. As you familiarize yourself with the pen, remember:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady pressure is best. For most beginner designs, you'll want the indents etched by the pen to be even all around.\nThe longer you hold your pen in one area, the darker and deeper it will get.\n\n, Turn your piece of wood until most of the grain is pointing downward. This will make your job much easier, as you will be moving your pen in a downward direction most of the time, thereby burning with the grain. Burning against the grain will offer up more resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Once you have got your materials and you know the basics, get several pieces of practice wood and practice with the various tips that will come with your wood burner. Once you have a good idea of what each tip does, then you will know which ones to use for various projects. The tips you will use will depend upon what type of picture and how much detail you are going to put in the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you are a killer artist and drawing is your thing, you may find it fun to draw directly onto the wood you're using with a graphite pencil. It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image.\n\n, Make or print out a sketch of your image. Place the graphite paper, face down, on top of the wood, secure it to the wood with a bit of masking tape, and your sketch on top of the graphite paper. Then with a 2B pencil, trace over the sketch with medium pressure and fluid lines. Remove the graphite paper and deepen the outline on the wood with the same 2B pencil.\n\n, A transfer tip is a flat tip that uses heat to transfer the ink of a printed image directly onto the wood. Scan or find an imagine online that you'd like to use. Print out the image, preferably with a laser printer. Next, fasten the printed image to your wood with a clamp and begin to head up the transfer tip. Slowly, methodically, brush the back side of the paper \u2014 above where any ink is \u2014 with the transfer tip. Remove the paper and inspect your newly-transferred design.\n\n, This only takes a second, and should be done often. If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn.\n\n, This way, if you mess up, your flaw won't be pointing you straight in the face. Rest assured though \u2014 you can correct most mistakes by simply sanding them out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Remember, easy does it. You only want to apply light pressure so that you can stay nimble with your pen. Try to move the pen towards you, not away from you, as you begin to burn, with your wrist resting on the wood if possible.\n\n, Burn over the outlines of your design first to get them set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you want to try to make a wood burn image 3D instead of the customary 2D, you'll want to experiment with different tips \u2014 tips that express shades and textures. As always, a few hours of practice on the back of a scrap piece of wood will be invaluable when it comes to shading on the real deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You are now ready to start adding color to your image. Color is optional and may look better on some images then on others. You will want to use water colors and a brush of your choice. (Watercolors pencils work especially well.)\n\n, You can run your tips over a sanding block for a quick fix, or you can clean your (cooled off) tips on a strop using aluminum oxide. This removes excess carbon that sticks to the tips.Submerge your tips in cold water for a minute or two before touching if you're unsure how hot they are. Remember to use your pliers to safely detach any and all tips.\n\n, Some woods give off more smoke than others, smoke which can be breathed in and become irritating to your lungs. To counteract this, put on a fan if you're working in an enclosed area.\n\n, The last step is to put a wood finisher on your product. Let this dry thoroughly before your wood burning project is completely finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":614}

For example, if you have a section title page for desserts, write \"Desserts\" on the tab., Stagger the tabs when you stick them down onto the pages. Each tab should be positioned a little bit lower than the previous tab. That way, you will be able to see all the tabs at once when you open the binder and look down at it., You can put them in any order you want, but make sure that they are under the right sections.\n\n, Recipe binders make great gifts, especially if they are filled with treasured family recipes that have been passed down for generations. They can also make an ideal going-away-to-college gift.\n\n, You can arrange your binder however you think would be the most helpful for you. This section will give you a few ideas on how to do this. You don't have to use all the ideas from this section., If you have a lot of recipes, you could divide them up further between several binders. For example, you can have a binder for baked goods and another one for salads. You could even have a special one just for family recipes., This means that if you have a section for pies, you might arrange your recipes like this: apple pie, blueberry pie, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, rhubarb pie, etc., This can help make your binder look more orderly. It can also help you find recipes quicker. Here are some ideas for you:\n\nAlphabetize the sections. For example: appetizers, beverages, cakes and cookies, desserts, pasta, poultry, salads, etc.\nArrange the sections in the order you might eat a meal. For example: breakfast, lunch, appetizers, salad, main course, dessert, etc.\n\n, This will make finding recipes a lot easier.\n\n\nStart by writing down the name of your recipe book in the top center of the page. Use a large, fancy font.\nNext, write down the names of the sections in a slightly smaller font. You can still use a fancy font. The section names should be on the left side of the page.\nLastly, write down the names of the recipes in a smaller, but plain, font. Make sure that the recipes are under the right section. The recipes should also be on the left.\nIf your binder has page numbers, write them down on the right side. The font should be the same as the one you used for the recipe names.\n\n, If you think you might want to keep adding to your binder, it might be a good idea to include two or three extra pages at the end of each section. This way, if you come across a recipe you like, all you have to do it print it out or write it down. If you are using stationary paper, you won't have to worry about trying to find the same design again., These sections aren't based off of any regular food group, such as soups, salads, cakes, and so forth. They are unique and include dishes from multiple food groups. Here are some examples:\n\nInclude some categories inspired by foods from different countries, such as: Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, etc.Add a section for your favorite recipes.\nPut all of the recipes you are interested in trying out in their own section.\nHave a special section for holiday recipes. This will make finding all of those recipes for Thanksgiving a lot easier., Sometimes, you run out of a certain ingredient and don't have the time to run to the store. Research some common substitutions, and print them out onto a sheet of paper. Add this to the back of your binder.Some common cooking substitutions include margarine for butter and white vinegar for lemon juice.\n\nYou can also include a section for healthy substitutions, such as wheat flour for white flour, or apple sauce instead of oil\/butter., This will come in handy if you are living in the UK and are working with a US recipe, and vice versa. It will also come in handy when you need to measure out liters using cups instead., You can also just use an empty page protector. This is great for those recipes you are not sure about and don't want to put the effort into printing them out just yet., You can tape it to the back of your binder. You can also keep it in its own page protector. This will allow you to keep track of what recipes you have tried and didn't like, so you can avoid using them in the future., You can leave your binder as is, or you can add some special touches to it. This section will give you some ideas. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this section, however. Use the ones you like the most., Stationary paper usually has a pretty boarder. This can make your recipes more interesting to look at.\n\nStationary paper also tends to come in different themes. Choose a theme you like. You can also match the theme to your binder.\nIf you have a special section for holiday recipes, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, try matching the paper to the holiday. For example, use paper that has pumpkins or autumn leaves for Thanksgiving recipes, and paper that has snowflakes or Christmas trees for Christmas recipes.\n\n, You can add step-by-step pictures to your recipes. You could also add a picture of the final dish instead. This will make the recipes more colorful. The photos will also give you an idea of what the final dish is supposed to look like in the end., You can make a plain binder more interesting by decorating a sheet of paper, and slipping it behind the clear, protective cover. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nIf you just want a fancy cover, use a sheet of scrapbook paper. You may have to trim it down a little in order to get it to fit.\nGive your binder a title. Write the title down on some paper and slip it behind the protective sheet on the cover. You call it anything you want, such as: You Name's Cookbook.\nUse an opaque fabric marker to draw designs on a fabric-covered binder. Most fabric markers come in opaque and transparent colors. Don't use a transparent fabric marker. The colors will blend right into the fabric and won't show up well.\nIf your binder already has a pattern on it, you could use letter stickers to give it a title.\n\n, This can be a nice way to introduce each section. Here are some ideas\"\n\nIf you have a salad section, add a picture of your favorite salad onto the title page.\nIf you have a section for desserts or pastries, add a picture of a fancy cake or pie.\nIf you have all of the recipes you want in that section, consider adding a mini table of contents. Right beneath the title, write down the names of all the recipes that are in that section. This will help remind you of what is in there.\n\n, This will allow you to get a bit more creative, and match the design of the tab to the rest of your binder. Here's how to make one:\n\nCut some colored paper into a \u00bd by 1 inch (1.27 by 2.54 centimeter) rectangle.\nLabel the tab.\nCut some clear packaging tape into a 1\u00bd by 1\u00bd inch (3.81 centimeter) square\nPlace the \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeter) of the tape onto the side of the page protector.\nPlace the tab under the tape. The long side of the rectangle should flush with the edge of the page protector. It should also be centered on the tape.\nFold the tape over and press it down onto the back of the page protector.\n\n, Using just a few items, you can make your own rustic recipe binder. Here's what you will need:2 sheets thin cardboard or illustration board\nPrinter paper\n2 \u2013 3 binder rings\nMarkers or letter stickers\n\n, Make sure that they are the same size. These will be the front and back cover of your binder., The paper you are using should be a little bit smaller than the covers., You will need two to three holes. The top and bottom hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top and bottom of the covers., Place the back cover down on a table in front of you, then stack the recipe pages on top of it. Place the front cover on top. Align the holes as best you can., Close the binder rings once all the pages, including the covers, are on them. You can buy binder rings from an office supply store or an arts and crafts store., Write a title using marker or letter stickers. You can also draw on a border using markers or glitter paint., Because the binder is made from paper, you will have to take extra care of it. If you are worried about it getting dirty, consider keeping it in a box or in a cupboard.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":617}

{"text":" It's a good idea to have someone to help you \u2014 either an experienced horse person or your veterinarian. You should certainly have an experienced professional supervise you the very first time you give an injection. If your veterinarian can't make the trip, see if a vet tech can help you out.;\n, A needle-shy horse will be able to tell what you're up to, even if he can't see the needle! He'll act up even before getting the shot because he knows what's coming and wants to prevent it. These behaviors can include rearing, biting, and kicking. For everyone's safety in this situation, it's best to have a professional do the job.\n\n\nIf you lack experience, you could end up hurting the horse, even if you escape injury yourself. There's a good chance the needle could bend, possibly while still in the horse. This could damage the horse's muscle, and might even call for surgical removal.\n\n, For example, some horse tranquilizers can cause respiratory arrest (stop breathing) in humans.\n\n, Even sticking the needle through a stopper on a medicine bottle dulls the point a bit. This, in turn, makes the injection more painful for the horse. The needle needs to be as sharp as possible to penetrate the horse's skin quickly and easily. If you encounter a needle-shy horse, he may be that way because of the pain associated with a blunt needle in the past.\n\n, Because muscles have a good blood supply, the medicine is absorbed into the blood stream nicely.\n\n\nSome medications may sting when given IM. The packaging for these products might recommend against giving the medicine through an IM shot. On the other hand, some IM injections contain preservatives that are not suitable for injection into a blood vessel.\nIt's not likely you'll have to give an intravenous injection. Do not attempt one, though, unless you are a qualified veterinarian or vet tech.\n\n, The two most common sites for giving an injection are the neck and hindquarters. Either site is fine \u2014 location is largely a matter of your personal preference. That said, it's best to inject skittish horses in the neck, as you can't get kicked from that position. The large muscle of the hindquarters are better if you need to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more), though.Always check with your vet or the directions on the medication packaging for the recommended injection site.\n\n, The person helping you (the handler) should stand on the same side as of the horse as you. The horse's head should be slightly turned toward the handler. This decreases the chances of someone getting run over or stepped on if the horse reacts badly during the injection process.\n\n\nIt's best not to tie the horse. A big physical reaction could hurt either the horse or the handlers, or damage the equipment.\n\n, Have your handler speak soothingly to the horse while you position yourself by the injection site.If the horse remains restless, try using a twitch to keep him still during the injection. While it may look uncomfortable, a twitch is perfectly safe and humane, and is widely used to ease stress in horses. The most common type of twitch is a loop of rope attached to a pole.\n\n\nPlace the horse's upper lip in the loop of rope.\nTighten the loop by rotating the pole round and round.\nThis gentle compression of the upper lip has a calming effect, like when a mother cat picks up a kitten by the scruff.\nIt is best to have your handler operate the twitch, leaving your hands free to give the injection.\n\n, One of your main concerns when injecting a horse should be the safety of all involved. When injecting at the neck, you stand in a fairly safe position beside the horse's shoulder \u2014 far from kicking back hooves. You also have more control of the horse, as well, since you're by his head. All told, neck injections just provide a safer environment than hindquarter injections, and are a good option.\n\n, Locate the triangle between the point of the horse's shoulder and the slope of the shoulder blade. The upper side of the triangle is the \"nuchal ligament\" \u2014 the arc of muscle along the top of the horse's neck. The lower side of the triangle is formed by the neck bones as they snake upwards from the shoulder in an \"S\" shape.\n\n\nTo find this triangle, put the heel of your hand against the front of the horse's shoulder, about a third of the way up the neck.\nWhere your palm rests is the safe place to give the injection.\n\n, If you give the injection too high up the neck, the medicine will enter the nuchal ligaments that hold the head up. This is extremely painful for the horse, and will continue to cause him pain every time he moves his head. But if you go too low, the needle may glance off the bones of the neck vertebra, which is also painful for the horse.\n\n\nYou could also hit the jugular vein if you go too low. If you're delivering a medication unsuitable for intravenous use, the horse could die.\n\n, This injection site is more effective than the neck, but also more dangerous because you have to stand closer to the back end and the danger of being kicked. However, the hindquarters are the preferred location if you have to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more). For example, penicillin comes in large doses.\n\n, Your target muscle for this type of injection is the \"semitendinosus muscle,\" which is at the very back of the horse's rump. Imagine a horse sitting down like a dog \u2014\u00a0the semitendinosus muscle is the one he would sit on. In foals, this is one of the largest muscles in the body, which adds to its appeal for IM injections.\n\n, Begin by finding the point of the buttocks (the bony bit far back on the pelvis). Drop an imaginary vertical line down to the ground, along the back of the leg. You will give the injection into the bulging muscle located along this line.\n\n\nTake care to inject into the muscle, not into the \"dip\" where the muscle buts against a neighboring one.\nThe \"dip\" is low in blood vessels. Medicine injected there will not be absorbed well, and will be less effective.\n\n, But, the blood supply to this area isn't particularly good, so medicine may be less effective when injected there. Furthermore, if an abscess forms at the needle site, it can be hard to drain off and get rid of.\n\n\nOnly inject in the top of the rump if you have no other options.\n\n, Some people like to tap the horse a few times at the injection site, but this is a bad idea. Taps are fast, punch-like blows given with the heel of the hand before the needle's inserted. Some believe it numbs the skin so the horse won't feel the needle. But, tapping only warns the horse that something is about to happen \u2014 especially if you've used that technique before. The horse will be calmer if he doesn't know what's about to happen.\n\n, When you first insert the needle, you want to do it without the medicine attached to it. This will allow you to \"draw back\" and make sure you've placed the needle accurately.\n\n, Using a sharp, new, sterile needle for each injection, push the needle into the muscle in a smooth, confident motion. The needle should form a 90\u00b0 angle with the muscle. Insert the needle all the way up to the hub (the part where the metal needle joins onto the syringe).\n\n, Many medications can be dangerous for the horse if delivered into a blood vessel. In worst case scenarios, it can result in death. To avoid this, always \"draw back\" before giving an injection. This simple action makes sure your needle is in the muscle, not a blood vessel.\n\n\nOnce you've inserted the needle into the injection site, pull back on the syringe plunger a little bit.\nIf the needle is in a blood vessel, you'll see blood getting pulled into the needle hub (the bit left sticking out of the skin).\nRemove the needle and do NOT inject.\nUse a new, sharp needle to find the injection site again, then repeat the drawing back process until you're confident you're in the right place.\n\n, Draw back on the plunger one more time to double-check for the presence of blood. If all is clear, then press steadily onto the plunger to give the injection. Once the syringe is empty, withdraw the syringe and needle together.\n\n, A blob of blood might form in the needle hole in the horse's skin. If so, apply gentle pressure with a ball of cotton wool for at least two minutes. By that time, the bleeding should have stopped, but if not, keep holding the wool against the wound until it does.\n\n, Once used, they're considered \"clinical waste,\" which means you can't just throw them in the trash. You have to dispose of them in a way approved by local authorities.\n\n\nStore used needles and syringes in a plastic container with a lid. An empty ice-cream tub or similar container will be just fine.\nGive the container to your veterinarian for safe disposal at the clinic.\nMake sure to keep the container out of reach from children while the needles are in your care.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":619}
{"text":";\n, The skin and bone adds thickness to the chicken breasts, essentially doubling the amount of time they need to cook.\n\n, These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.\n\n, The addition of a bone adds more cooking time to this cut. Moreover, as dark meat, thighs need to cook for a little longer than breasts.\n\n, Since drumsticks have less meat on them than thighs, they do not usually need to cook for quite as long.\n\n, Add another 10 to 20 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional 1 lb (450 g).\n\n, The exact size stockpot you need may vary depending on how large your chicken pieces are and how much room they take up inside the pot. As a general rule, the chicken should take up roughly 1\/4 to 1\/3 of the space in your stockpot.\n\n\nAn 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot is fairly standard and will usually be enough to hold a whole chicken. A larger stockpot may be needed for birds bigger than 4 lb (1800 g), though.\nYou can use an 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot for boneless chicken breasts, but you could also opt for a smaller stockpot so that the water will boil faster.\n\n, Pour enough cold water into the stockpot to cover the chicken completely.\n\n\nCold water is preferable to warm water.\n\n, You can sprinkle anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt into the water. A smaller amount is better for boneless chicken breasts and chicken tenders, but a larger amount may be better for whole chickens.\n\n\nNote that the salt is only optional. You could boil the chicken without salt, but it will be much blander as a result.\n\n, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken on medium heat. Follow the recommended cooking time listed in this article for your cut of chicken.\n\n, Place enough chicken broth into your stockpot to fill the stockpot halfway.\n\nChicken broth intensifies the flavor of the chicken, so it becomes less bland than chicken boiled in water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use pre-made broth, but if you do not have pre-made broth, you can combine chicken broth granules with water. You usually need 1 tsp (5 ml) or one cube of chicken bouillon per 1 cup (250 ml) of water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse chicken stock instead of broth for an even richer, deeper flavor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Cutting the vegetables up allows more of the flavor to seep into the cooking liquid.\n\nPeel the onions and cut them into halves or quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash the carrots with water and slice them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRinse the celery and cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Transfer the chopped vegetables to the stockpot. The vegetables add dimension to the flavor of the broth.\n\n\nStrictly speaking, the vegetables are not needed. Chicken can be boiled in plain broth.\n\n, Transfer the chicken to the stockpot. If necessary, add more broth or water to the stockpot so that the chicken is completely covered.\n\n, Bring the broth the a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the chicken simmers slowly.\n\n\nCook according to the recommended cooking times listed in this article.\nRemove the chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon when done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf desired, strain the cooking liquid and save the broth as stock for future recipes. You can store stock in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 months.\nYou will likely end up discarding the vegetables used in this recipe, since the texture will turn mushy. The primary purpose of the vegetables in this recipe is to add flavor, not to serve as a side dish.\n\n, Pile the chicken into your stockpot and cover with enough water and apple juice to completely cover the chicken.\n\nFor a stronger apple flavor, pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of apple juice into the stockpot before filling the rest of the stockpot up with enough water to cover the chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more subtle apple flavor, pour equal parts apple juice and water into the stockpot simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also use apple cider instead of apple juice. Apple cider tends to have a sharper taste, which some find preferable to the milder taste of apple juice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the combination of chicken, water, and apple juice fills between 1\/2 and 3\/4 of the stockpot.\n\n, The savory taste of the vegetables in this recipe balances out the natural sweetness of the apple juice.\n\nPeel the onion and cut it into halves or quarters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRinse the carrots under running water and cut them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using cloves of garlic, mince 4 cloves of garlic. If using garlic powder, use 1\/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the seasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use anywhere between 1 tsp (5 ml) and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chopped fresh thyme. If using dried thyme, cut this down to 1\/3 the amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Disperse the onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme in the apple juice mixture.\n\n, Bring the liquid up to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the liquid only simmers, then cover and let cook according to the amount of time indicated in the \"cooking times\" section.\n\n, About 10 minutes before the chicken finishes cooking, begin preparing the apple. Peel the apple, core it, and cut it into small slices.\n\n\nThe addition of the apple near the end of the cooking time will infuse an even stronger apple flavor into the chicken.\n\n, Strain out the chicken when done and serve without any of the vegetables, fruit, seasonings, or cooking liquid.\n\n\nThe other ingredients serve to infuse the chicken with flavor as it cooks. The ingredients themselves, however, will be too soft and mushy to be very appetizing at this point.\n\n, Add the dry white wine and chicken broth first. Then, fill the pot with enough water to reach the halfway point.\n\nWine can infuse chicken meat with a tremendous amount of flavor, but using too much could be overpowering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly use chicken broth in equal parts with the wine. Otherwise, the flavor of the chicken broth could end up competing with the flavor of the wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDilute with water only as necessary.\n\n, Toss the pearl onions, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme into the cooking liquid.\n\n\nPearl onions do not need to be cut beforehand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not have pre-minced garlic on hand, you could mince or crush 6 cloves of garlic instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using fresh herbs, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of each herb. For dried herbs, cut this amount down to 1 tsp (5 ml) each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Bring the cooking liquid up to a boil over medium-high heat. Let sit at this temperature for 2 to 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer.\n\n\nDoing this allows some of the flavor of the seasoning to be released and some of the bitterness of the wine to cook off.\n\n, Add the chicken to the cooking liquid using tongs. Bring the liquid back up to a boil before reducing the heat again.\n\n, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken at a steady simmer for the recommended cooking time indicated.\n\n\nServe the chicken only. The liquid and other ingredients are meant to add flavor, not to be served alongside the chicken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":620}

{"text":" You lose weight when you burn more calories than you eat, so an inactive person who eats a lot of food will likely gain weight. The first step to losing weight is eating fewer calories. Track how many calories you eat in a day by writing down calorie information on all the food and drinks you consume. For foods that don't have nutrition labels, use the USDA Food Database to look up how many calories the item has.Find out how many calories your body needs to maintain your current weight by using an online calculator that takes your activity level into account. Try this one online www.bmrcalculator.org\/.\nA pound of fat has 3,500 calories in it.To lose a pound of fat each week, every day you should eat 500 calories less than what your body needs to maintain its current weight.;\n, When you eat too much food, your body turns it into fat and stores it for future use. Read food labels to find out what an appropriate serving size should be. If you want to eat something without a label, check the American Dietetic Association Food Exchange list for proper serving sizes.Use measuring cups and a kitchen scale to make sure your servings match the recommended portion size.\nRestaurants can be tricky because they usually serve extremely large portion sizes. Some restaurants post their nutrition information online, though. If possible, check the nutrition information beforehand and plan a meal between 500\u2013600 calories.\nRemember that you never have to eat the whole plate. Eat half your food to reach your calorie goal, then save the rest for later. You may be able to ask your server to put half of your meal in a to-go box before bringing out your food.\nSome restaurants also have lighter menu options or half-portion sizes of their larger meals. Order off of this lighter menu whenever possible.\n\n, Healthy fats like unsaturated oils should be the primary fat source in your diet. Cook with olive or canola oil instead of butter or lard. Other sources of healthy fats include nuts, seeds, avocados, fish, and natural peanut butter. Don't eat anything that has trans fat or lists the words \u201cpartially hydrogenated\u201d in the ingredients list. You should avoid saturated fats as much as possible, limiting them to less than 10% of your total calories.\n\n\nTo calculate total calories from saturated fat, multiply the grams of fat by nine. For example, a food item with 5 grams of saturated fat has 45 calories from saturated fat.\nDivide these calories by your total calories for the day, then multiply by 100. You want this final number to be less than 10.\nFor example, if I ate 210 calories from saturated fat and 2,300 calories for the day, I would have eaten 9% of calories from saturated fat.\n\n, Processed foods go through some type of processing in a factory, and are usually found packaged in boxes, cans, bags, or other packaging. Often (although not always) they are higher in fat, sugar, and salt that can prevent you from losing weight. They also can lack a lot of the nutrients found in whole foods. Slowly eliminate processed foods from your diet by cutting two to three processed items per day. Replace them with whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds.\n\n\nHighly processed foods are an indicator it may be high in undesirable food qualities.\nBut just because a food is processed does not necessarily mean that is the case. There are many foods that are in packages that are quite good on a healthy diet, such as frozen vegetables, frozen fish fillets, or popcorn.\nAlso be aware that food that did not come from a bag, box, or the like may still be unhealthy. A chocolate brownie made from organic ingredients from scratch is still a brownie.\nAt the store, avoid the processed foods in the aisles by mainly shopping the perimeter, where the produce, dairy, meat and seafood, and bakery are. Only choose select items that are low-processed from aisles like the cooking aisle.\nMake meals from scratch ahead of time and freeze them into portion sizes to be eaten during the week. Homemade soups with tons of vegetables are a great freezer option.Look for foods that have three or fewer ingredients on the ingredients list to avoid highly processed items.\n\n, It has many health benefits, including keeping your digestive tract healthy, and keeping you feeling full longer so you don't overeat. Fiber is found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. Eat 25-30 grams of fiber each day with plenty of water.\n\n\nFruits that are high in fiber include raspberries, blackberries, mango, and guava.\nVegetables that are high in fiber include split peas, lentils, artichokes, and broccoli.\n\n, Water is a major player in weight control. It helps flush metabolic waste out of your system, keeping your metabolism running high to quickly burn fat. Water will also keep you feeling full so you don't overeat. The adequate intake for men is 3 liters of water each day (about 13 cups) while women should drink 2.2 liters per day (about 9 cups).\n\n\nIf you take part in high activity exercise or cardio during the day or live in a very hot climate, you may need to increase your water intake.\n\n, Instead of eating three large meals each day, eat six smaller ones. Your body can process food better in smaller amounts, resulting in less excess food being stored as fat. This can also steady your blood sugar levels and improve your absorption of vitamins and minerals.Just make sure these smaller meals are are made up of healthy, whole foods instead of processed food. You might consider this sample meal plan:\n\n\nMeal #1 (8 a.m.): One medium banana with \u00bd cup of oatmeal.\nMeal #2 (10 a.m.): A smoothie made with 1 cup of spinach, four medium strawberries, \u2153 cup of raspberries, 1 tbsp of flaxseed, and 8 fl oz of unsweetened almond milk.\nMeal #3 (12 p.m.): One slice of whole wheat toast topped with one boiled egg and \u00bc cup of mashed avocado.\nMeal #4 (3 p.m.): 1 cup of salad topped with \u00bd avocado, \u00bc cup cottage cheese, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, and a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.\nMeal #5 (5 p.m.): 4 oz of baked chicken with a side of green beans and \u00bd cup of brown rice.\nMeal #6 (7 p.m.): \u00bd cup of cooked quinoa mixed with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and pepper.\n\n, To achieve the best fat-burning results, start out by exercising for two hours and 30 minutes each week, then increasing it by 30 minutes every week. Combining both weightlifting and high intensity cardio is the best way to maximize fat-burning. Consider following this sample four-week workout schedule:\n\n\nSundays: Week One \u2014 45 min. Cardio; Week Two \u2014 45 min. Cardio; Week Three \u2014 60 min. Cardio; Week Four \u2014 60 min. Cardio\nMondays: OFF all four weeks\nTuesdays: Week One \u2014 30 min Strength Upper Body; Week Two \u2014 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Three \u2014 45 min Strength Upper Body; Week Four \u2014 60 min Strength Upper Body\nWednesdays: OFF all four weeks\nThursdays: Week One \u2014 45 min Cardio; Week Two \u2014 45 min Cardio; Week Three \u2014 60 min. Cardio; Week Four \u2014 60 min. Cardio\nFridays: OFF all four weeks\nSaturdays: Week One \u2014 30 min Strength Lower Body; Week Two \u2014 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Three \u2014 45 min Strength Lower Body; Week Four \u2014 60 min Strength Lower Body\n\n, Strength exercises can be done with weights, resistance bands, or just using your body weight. Try mixing up strength training exercises that work different muscle parts in the body. Start out at a slightly difficult weight or resistance and do three sets of 10 for each exercise or until failure. Once you can do that weight three workouts in a row (full three sets of 10) without failing, increase the weight or resistance by one level.\n\n\nExercises for the lower body include squats, calf raises, lunges, deadlifts, and leg press.\nUpper body exercises include push-ups, sit-ups, chest press, overhead press, bicep curls, tricep dips, and lateral pull-downs.\n\n, Cardio speeds up fat-burning, but it also has many other health benefits including decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nRunning, jogging or walking: If you start out walking, make it your goal to work up to jogging, then running.\nEnjoy outdoor activities like sports, swimming, hiking, and biking.\nIf you belong to a gym, use its treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and stair climbers.\nTry interval exercises, like multiple sprints with jogging in between.\nSwitch between high intensity cardio and slower\/longer endurance cardio for maximum fat burning.\n\n, This is because lack of sleep causes changes in metabolism and fat-burning.These tips can help you get a good night\u2019s sleep:Make sure the room is completely dark with dark curtains or sheets over the window.\nDo not eat for at least two hours before going to bed in order to prevent heartburn or an increase in energy when you are trying to go to sleep.\nOnly use your bed for sleeping and sex. Do not do other activities such as watching TV, reading, listening to music, or working on the computer while you are in bed.\n\n, Making small lifestyle changes throughout the day will help make your new habits stick. In the end, you will have made a positive change to a healthier lifestyle that you will be able to maintain long-term. Some small gestures you can make throughout the day to make a healthy lifestyle change include:\n\n\nTake the stairs instead of the elevator.\nPark in the back of the parking lot.\nStart a hobby that involves you moving around, like hiking or biking.\nGo to a weekly farmer\u2019s market to buy fresh produce.\nStart a garden of your own.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":622}

While you are there, you can buy some books or other materials, and you will find yourself surrounded by French speakers, particularly outside of Montreal. Keep in mind though that you the farther you go from the Montreal you travel, you will find more people using French which is not as easily recognizable as international French. For example, in Qu\u00e9bec's Gaspesie region, many heritages have influenced the development of language over the centuries, as many of the original settlers came from the Guernsey and the Jersey Islands, and not from France. The French dialects spoken in New Brunswick and Louisiana fall under the umbrella \"Acadian French\", and have local colour and unique differences of their own.\n\n\nLearn the written form of common French words for daily use.\nYou can try watching a DVD, but change the language to French.

{"text":" For cooking pizza and cookies, the top rack in the center is the ideal location. For cooking bread, biscuits, and other items, the middle rack in the center is the better choice.;\n, Never put a cold pizza stone in a hot oven, as it can shatter due to thermal shock.In fact, make sure never to expose the pizza stone to rapid temperature shifts. Placing a frozen pizza on a pizza stone is almost as likely to result in a shattered stone as placing a cold stone in a hot oven. You're better off cooking your frozen pizza straight on the rack.\n\n,, Do not grease or oil. For breads and pizza crust, you may want to add a little cornmeal to aid removal.\n\n\nIt can take a little finessing to get used to, but a pizza paddle is a useful instrument, especially for transferring uncooked pizza dough onto the stone. There are three different kinds of peels \u2014 short-handled wooden peels, long-handled wooden peels, and metal peels. For the average person cooking at home, the short-handled wooden peel will probably work best.\nIf you don't want to use cornmeal under your dough, you can also use flour. Rice flour is a great way to ensure the dough doesn't stick to your paddle., You do not have to remove it at all, as it can add to a \"brick oven effect\" that actually helps your oven retain and spread heat more evenly. You can put cooking dishes, pots, pans, cookie trays, and so on right on the stone.\n\n, Of course, only do this once you're sure the pizza stone is cool enough to handle.\n\n, The pizza stone can be cleaned and rinsed entirely with water. With a clean sponge, wipe away any remaining food or grime using only water. Do not try to remove oils that build up \u2014 it is fully unnecessary. Leaving the oils on the stone actually helps season the stone, turning it into a slicker, more easy-to-use item.\n\n, A simple once-over is probably more than enough. If you pizza stone happens to absorb too much moisture when it's soaking in the sink, it can crack the next time you heat it in the oven., Stains on your pizza stone are normal and almost unavoidable. Moreover, they're like a badge of honor, or experience points \u2014 something that you point to as a vindication of your cooking skills.\n\n, You can house your pizza stone in the oven even as you bake other items. Just bake them on top of the stone itself. For heavier items, like a roast, move the pizza stone to the bottom rack before cooking.\n\n, You should know how much space you have to work with before you select your stone. You'll be kicking yourself if you buy a stone and then realize that your oven isn't large enough for it.\n\n, If you're a bottom line sort of person and only worried about the taste of your pizza, not the look of your stone, you can purchase a quarry stone for around $5 to $10. You can start your search at any home improvement store like Home Depot or Lowe's.\n\n\nLook for clay or shale tiles, specifically, when you search for your stone. Terracotta tile works really well, as does most any stone that is labeled \"all natural clay and shale.\"\n\n, Glazed quarry stones contain lead, which is poisonous and generally to be avoided in all cooking items., Although one larger stone may be more aesthetically pleasing, several smaller stones may be more versatile in the end. You can position several smaller stones on various racks on your oven; they'll absorb heat, meaning that you can turn off your oven and let the heat emanate from the stones without burning extra energy. With several smaller stones, the heat gets more evenly dispersed.\n\n, Enjoy pizza, French bread, cookies, bagels, and much more.\n\n,,,, Cook for about five minutes.\n\n,, The half cooked crust should be much easier to slide off the peel and back into the oven despite the extra weight.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":626}
{"text":" Your Betta may also have a paler hue than normal and white or cotton-like patches on his body. These are all signs of a fungal infection. Fungus can grow in tanks that are not treated with salt and Aquarisol once the tank water is added.The fungus can spread quickly from one infected fish to the other fish in the tank so it should be treated right away.;\n, This is a symptom of a bacterial infection called popeye. Your fish may have developed popeye due to dirty tank water, or due to a more serious illness like tuberculosis. Sadly, tuberculosis is not curable in fish and is fatal for Betta fish. Tuberculosis can cause curved spines (not to be confused with the natural \"hump\" that older bettas develop). , These are symptoms of dropsy, which is a bacterial infection in your fish\u2019s kidneys. It can cause renal failure and fluid accumulation, or bloating. It often occurs in fish that are weakened due to poor water conditions or from eating contaminated food.Once your fish suffers from kidney failure as a result of fluid buildup, your fish will likely die. You can prevent your fish from contracting dropsy by not feeding him live worms or contaminated food. Aquarium salt baths can draw out fluid, and medicines can help. Since it's hard to know what medicines are appropriate, and usually dropsy worsens quickly, painlessly euthanizing is acceptable.\n\n, This is a sign of fish ick or ich. The spots may be slightly raised and your fish will likely scratch against objects in the tank due to irritated and itchy skin. Your fish may also have respiratory issues and appear to gasp at the surface of the tank water. Ick attacks fish that are stressed due to irregular water temperature and pH fluctuations in the water., These are all signs of a bacterial infection that causes your fish\u2019s fins, tail and mouth to rot. Fin rot typically occurs in fish who are bullied by other fish in the tank or who are injured by a fin-nipping tank mate. A poor tank environment can also contribute to the development of fin rot. However, if your fish is a crowntail, it is natural for him\/her to have a shredded looking fin.Luckily, most Betta fish can regrow their tail and fins if fin rot is treated in time. However, your Betta fish\u2019s tail and fins may not be as vibrant as they once were when they grow back.\nSome Betta fish can contract advanced body and fin rot when a case of regular fin rot goes untreated for a long period of time. Your fish may lose his fins and body tissue as the rot progresses. Once the rot eats your fish\u2019s body tissues, it can be difficult to cure the advanced fin rot and your fish will essentially be eaten alive.\n\n, This is a symptom of velvet, which is a parasite that is highly contagious. If your Betta has velvet, he may also clamp his fins close to his body, start to lose his color, have a lack of appetite, and may scratch against the sides of the tank or the gravel in the tank.As velvet is a highly contagious parasite, you should treat all the fish in your tank if one fish shows signs of velvet.\n\n, These are signs of swim bladder disorder, a common illness among Betta fish. Swim bladder disorder is caused by overfeeding your Betta fish, leading to a swollen swim bladder that causes your fish to float on one side or the lie at the bottom of the tank because swimming becomes too difficult.Keep in mind swim bladder is easy to treat and does not hurt your fish, so you do not need to worry about your fish dying due to swim bladder.\n\n, This is a symptom of anchor worms, which are small crustaceans that burrow into your fish\u2019s skin and enter his muscles. They then release eggs in your fish before they die, leaving behind damage in your fish that can become infected.Your Betta can contract an external parasite like anchor worms due to exposure at the pet store, from his food, or from infected fish who are introduced to his tank.\n\n\nYour fish may also scratch against objects to try to remove the anchor worms, and the points where the anchor worms are attached to your fish may be swollen.\n\n, If your Betta lives with other fish in a tank, use a clean Betta fish net to remove him from the tank and place him a smaller tank with the necessary filtration system. This will then allow you to treat the water and the tank for any diseases, without harming your fish.\n\n\nYou should also check that the quarantine tank has the right water temperature for your Betta, between 78 degrees and 80\u00a0\u00b0F (26.7\u00a0\u00b0C)., You can find this treatment at your local pet store. You can also treat ich by raising the temperature of your tank if your tank is larger than five gallons. If your tank is smaller than five gallons, you should avoid raising the temperature as this can kill your Betta fish.Raise the tank temperature in large tank in increments to avoid shocking your Betta until it reaches 85 degrees. This will kill the ich parasite.\nIf you have a small tank, clean your tank completely, do a full water change and treat the water with Aquarisol and aquarium salt. You can also move your Betta fish to a temporary container and raise the temperature of the water to 85 degrees to kill any remaining ich parasites before you introduce your Betta fish back to the tank.\nYou can prevent the develop of ich by maintaining a consistent water temperature and cleaning the tank weekly.\n\n, These medications can kill off the fungus and prevent your Betta from developing more fungus that can cause fin and tail rot. You should also clean the tank completely and do a complete water change. Treat the new water with ampicillin or tetracycline, as well as a fungus eliminator.You will need to do a tank cleaning and a full water change every three days, adding the medication in each water change, to kill the fungus for good. Once your Betta fish no longer appears to be losing tissue on his tail or fins, you can resume your normal tank cleaning schedule.\nYou can use ampicillin to also treat Popeye in your Betta. Do a tank cleaning and full water change every three days, adding ampicillin with each water change. Your fish\u2019s Popeye symptoms should disappear within one week.\n\n, If your fish shows any signs of an external parasite such as anchor worms or velvet, you should change out at least 70% of the tank water. You will then need to treat the remaining water with BettaZing to kill any remaining parasites and their eggs.You can purchase BettaZing at your local pet store.\n\n, Bettas have small appetites, so you should only give your fish a small meal once a day to avoid overfeeding him. Your Betta should be able to consume all the food in his tank within two minutes of being fed. Excess food in your fish\u2019s tank can lead to poor water quality and make your Betta more susceptible to disease.You should feed your Betta a varied, high protein diet. Look for Betta approved foods at your local pet store, as well as frozen or processed tropical fish foods.\n\n, It\u2019s possible your Betta will contract a disease or infection at some point in his life span, so be prepared by having medications on hand to treat your Betta quickly and efficiently. Medications can be stressful for your Betta, and should only be used when you have confirmed your Betta has a specific disease or infection and medication is necessary to treat the issue. You can find Betta first aid kits at your local pet store. Your first aid kit should contain the following medications:BettaZing or Bettamax: These medications are anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, and anti-protozoan. They are useful for a number of issues, such as fungus and velvet parasites. You can also use this medication as a preventative measure if you are trying to get a Betta used to a new environment or every time you introduce a new Betta to your tank.\nKanamycin: This antibiotic can be found at many fish stores and pet stores. It can used for serious bacterial infections.\nTetracycline: This antibiotic is used to treat less serious bacterial infections like fungus.\nAmpicillin: This is a useful antibiotic for treating popeye and other infections. You can find this antibiotic in specialty fish stores and online.\nJungle Fungus Eliminator: This is an anti-fungal treatment that works on several fungus infections and is useful to keep on hand as a Betta fish owner.\nMaracin 1 and Maracin 2: These medications come in hard tablet form and can be used to treat mild infections like fin and tail rot. However, the are not as effective as other medications to treat more serious infections.\n\n, This will help to remove any waste buildup and any decaying organic matter from excess food and dead leaves or roots from plants. Doing a small partial water change weekly will also clean any toxins from the water and keep the water clean.Do not remove any of the aquarium plants or decorations from the tank or bowl. Removing or cleaning these items can kill the good bacteria that has been filtering through your tank and reduce the quality of your filtration system. As well, you do not need to remove your fish from the tank or bowl when you do a partial water change. This can stress out your fish and could expose him to harmful bacteria.You can use a siphon to suck up any gunk in the gravel and decorations. You should also use an algae scraper to remove algae on the surface of the tank or the tank ornaments before you remove any of the water.If your tank does not have a filter, start with clean water and test daily for ammonia. When the kit says there is ammonia, it's time for a water change. Getting a top cover for the bowl or a filter can reduce the water changes you will need to do and protect your fish from getting an infection or a disease.Check the water once a day to ensure it is not cloudy, foamy, or has an unusual odor. These could all be signs of a bacterial bloom and may require you to do a full water change.Doing this will prevent your Betta from developing any diseases or infections.\n\n, Bacterial infections like fin and tail rot can be prevented by adding aquarium salt to your tank water. Unlike table salt, aquarium salt does not contain any additives like iodine or calcium silicate. (Don't use table salt!) Do not use Aquarium Salt or copper-based medicines if your tank also includes Mystery Snails, Apple Snails, Cory Cats or Corydoras, as they can not handle these medicines and may die. Nerite snails are salt-tolerant, however they may not be able to handle copper, so proceed carefully.Always follow the instructions on the package for dosage amounts. Usually, manufacturers recommend one tablespoon of aquarium salt per five gallons of aquarium water.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":627}
{"text":" You need to trade Graveler with someone who has a game from the same Generation. For example, you can trade between Red and Blue (Generation I) or Diamond and Pearl (Generation III). You cannot trade between Blue and Pearl.\n\n\nYou cannot use a DS to trade between Generation III games. This is due to the lack of a link cable port on the DS.\nIf you are playing on an emulator, click here.;\n, This is required for trading in Generations I-IV. In Generation V and later, you can select any of your Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n\nMake sure Graveler is not holding an Everstone. This prevents evolutions.\n\n, How you connect varies depending on the system.\n\n\nGame Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance - Use a link cable to connect two of the systems. You cannot connect different versions of the Game Boy.\nNintendo DS - You can connect wirelessly within 30 feet. Generation V games can also connect via IR built-in to the cartridge. Use the C-Gear in the game. Click here for a guide on trading with the DS.\nNintendo 3DS\/2DS - Press the L and R buttons and select Player Search System. This will allow you to trade with the other nearby system. You can also connect to the internet and trade online. Make sure that your partner trades the evolved Golem back to you., It will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded. Graveler's level doesn't matter.\n\n\nSee if your friend has a Pok\u00e9mon that evolves through trading as well. That way you can knock them both out at once. Pok\u00e9mon that require trades include Clamperl, Electabuzz, Feebas, and more., Your new Golem will be on the other system. Have your friend trade it back to you to get your Golem.\n\n, Since it's not possible to trade using an emulator, you'll need to use a workaround to evolve Graveler (and other Pok\u00e9mon that rely on trading to evolve). If you're playing Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, you can use a fan-made hack to change Graveler into a Pok\u00e9mon that evolves when it reaches Level 50. This only works on the US versions of these ROM files.\n\n, You'll need to download the custom ROM editor from this forum. Follow the link at the top of the first post to download the editor, which is a very small file. Extract the files from the ZIP once you've downloaded it.\n\n, Run NitroExplorer2b.exe to start the editor. You may be prompted to install the .NET Framework files if they aren't already installed on your computer.\n\n, Press the \"Load ROM\" button and browse for your Pok\u00e9mon ROM file.\n\n, The file you need to select varies depending on the game you are modifying:\n\n\nDiamond, Pearl, and Platinum - Open the \"poketool\" folder, and then open the \"personal\" folder. Select the \"evo.narc\" file.\nHeartGold, SoulSilver - Open the \"a\" folder, then the \"0\" folder, followed by the \"3\" folder. Select the \"4\" file.\n\n, This will open the file browser.\n\n, there should be a \"4\" file in the same folder as NitroExplorer2b.exe. Select this file to insert into the ROM.\n\n, After replacing the file, you can start up your emulator and play your game. Graveler will now evolve into Golem at Level 50., You normally cannot trade between emulators, making it difficult to get Graveler to evolve. There is a special version of the VBA emulator called VBALink that allows you to run up to four instances of it at once. This lets you trade between the instances, but requires a bit of work to get going.\n\n, You'll find this process much easier if you keep everything you need in one spot. Create a folder called \"vbalink\" or something similar on your Desktop.\n\n, You can download the VBALink emulator from vbalink.info. Download the \"1.72\" file and extract the contents into your new folder.\n\n, These configuration files will make the trading process much smoother. Download the ZIP containing the three INI files from this forum thread. Extract the files into the same \"vbalink\" folder that the emulator files are in.\n\n, Copy the ROM file you normally use into the \"vbalink\" folder.\n\n, You'll need a saved game that is far enough in the game to allow for trading. The requirements for trading vary depending on the game.\n\n, Copy the \".sav\" file and paste it twice into the \"vbalink\" folder. This will leave you with the original and two copies.\n\n, Right-click the first copied saved game and select \"Rename\". Change the extension from \".sav\" to \".sa1\". Repeat the process for the second file, changing the extension to \".sa2\". You should now have a \".sav\", a \".sa1\", and a \".sa2\" file in the \"vbalink\" folder.\n\n\nIf you don't see file extensions, click the \"View\" tab in Explorer and check the \"File name extensions\" box.\n\n, Double-click the \"VisualBoyAdvance.exe\" program to start the emulator. Click \"File\" \u2192 \"Open\" and select your ROM file from the \"gbalink\" folder.\n\n, Walk upstairs and stand in front of the lady who will start the trade process. Do not talk to her yet.\n\n\nThe controls for the first window are WASD to move, Q for A, E for B, and Z for Select.\n\n, Make sure that \"Pause when inactive window\" is not checked.\n\n, Double-click \"VisualBoyAdvance.exe\" again to start another instance of VBAlink in another window. Drag this window to the right side of your screen. Click \"File\" \u2192 \"Open\" and select the same ROM file as you did before.\n\n, The controls for this window are different. Press TFGH to move, R for A, Y for B, and V for Select. Move the character to the Pok\u00e9mon Center and stand in front of the trade lady.\n\n, The game may hang for a few seconds, just be patient and avoid hitting more keys. Choose the \"Trade\" option from the menu.\n\n, This will make the character on the right screen speak to the trade lady. Select the \"Trade\" option. After a few moments, the trade interface should appear on both screens.\n\n, You'll only be keeping one of the save files, so pay attention to which screen you trade it to. Graveler will evolve into Golem as soon as it is traded.\n\n, After trading, you'll receive a notification that your game has saved. You can close your emulators at this point.\n\n, Select the save file you want to keep. If you are keeping the save file from the left screen, select the \".sa1\" file. If you are keeping the save file from the right screen, select the \".sa2\" file. Copy and paste the selected file back into your original emulator's directory.\n\n, Copy and paste the \".sav\" file in your emulator directory to somewhere else in case the new file doesn't work. You can move your old save back if something goes wrong.\n\n, Change the extension of the \".sa1\" or \".sa2\" file to \".sav\".\n\n, You should be able to load your game from your new save file with your newly-evolved Golem.\n\n\nIf your game doesn't work, copy the \"vba.ini\" file from the \"gbalink\" folder into your regular emulator folder.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":628}
{"text":" Find a font on Microsoft Word or another word processing program, print out the letters, and begin tracing them. Practice tracing these letters on a blank piece of paper.First trace the letters on a lined sheet of paper and then move to a blank sheet.\nSome pens work better than others. Try gel ink pens and calligraphy pens, however, if you cannot find those then a pencil will work just fine but will not have quite the same.\nA light box will be very useful for tracing the letters.;\n, Instead of printing, try writing your daily notes, homework and other handwriting in a distinctive cursive style. Emphasize the loops in letters and try not to jumble words together. Take your time and really concentrate on making your cursive look pretty.\n\n, It might help your writing if you practice copying something that you enjoy reading. In your elegant cursive, write what you are reading into your journal or notebook. Take your time and emphasize your style. You can also use line paper if you are still trying to master your style.\n\n, Elegant handwriting can be thicker or thinner depending on the type of writing utensil used. Markers are going to give you a larger font, while pens and pencils will be skinnier. Try out different writing tools and find one that works for you.\n\n\nYour art teacher or an employee at an art supply store should be able to recommend different writing tools for you to use.\n\n, Buy a lined paper that has an extra-large space for writing. Think of the kind of paper that you learned to write on when you were little. Slowly write your elegant letters, being sure to fill up the entire space. With practice, you will eventually be able to do this without the lines.\n\n\nTake your time and really concentrate on filling the space.\n\n, By practicing this visual art, you will learn how to write multiple styles of elegant handwriting. Calligraphy teaches you how to write elegantly with different tools in different medium. You will also develop the skills produce your own unique styles and fonts. If you stick with it, you will eventually be able to print, paint or chisel beautiful words on almost anything. There are workbooks and classes that you can take online to learn calligraphy.\nYour local community center or YMCA may also offer classes in calligraphy.\n\n, The muscles in the arm, shoulder, chest and back should be conducting all of the action while you write. Your forearm, hand and fingers should be still. Writing from your shoulder results in movement that is more intricate and gives you greater stamina. It also creates smoother and cleaner looking writing.\n\n\nThis movement will likely feel unnatural at first but it is crucial to developing your writing.\nAvoid writing with your fingers. The majority of people \u201cdraw\u201d their letters by moving the pen across the paper with their hand. This method is more tiresome and gives you less control over your writing.\nBe conscious of writing with your shoulder, making it a part of your writing practice.\n\n, Concentrate on writing using your shoulder and not your hand. Practice this until it feels natural. As you become more comfortable with the movement, make the letters smaller.You can also practice this method on a marker or chalk board.\n\n, Start with big letters and gradually move to smaller ones. Again, remember to avoid writing with your fingers and concentrate on your shoulder.\n\n, Start making Xs and \/\/\/s and OOOs and overlapped OOOs and spirals and | | | |s. Work on making this figures smoothly, uniformly, and evenly spaced. Practice drawing these figures daily emphasizing your strokes and movement. Repetition is important so practice these movements daily.\n\n, Focus on making clear, well-formed letters and words. Hurriedly writing results in messy or illegible writing. Remember that you want to write elegantly and that takes time., If you begin to get sore or fatigued, your writing will suffer. Get out of your chair and walk around. Stretch the muscles in your shoulder and hand. , There is not magic bullet for developing elegant handwriting. Daily practice is the only way to hone your skill and, luckily, there are many strategies for doing this.Set aside at least 20 minutes a day to write. Begin with five minutes and work your way up.\nFollow the curriculum laid out in a handbook or online lesson. These tend to have daily exercises as part of their instruction.\nWrite things out by hand more. Hand-write your notes and grocery lists. Start a journal and send written letters to friends and family. Keep a pocketbook.\n\n, Hold it near the writing end. It is important to have the proper grip on your writing utensil. Think of your hand as the vice that holds the pen in place while you write. Try not to rest it between the thumb and index finger with the barrel on the middle finger.\nAvoid placing the pen between thumb and the index and middle fingers with the pen resting on you ring finger.\n\n, Relax your hand while you hold the pen. Your grip needs to be firm but not so tight that your hand is tense. Having a loose grip helps relax your arm and give it greater dexterity. Imagine that the pen is made of soft rubber and that squeezing it too tightly will cause ink to blot everywhere.\n\n, Do not curl your hand over and write to the left of your palm. That position can leading to hand cramping and discomfort.This is an important tip for lefties to remember since they are more likely to curl their hand.\n\n, This will help you steady yourself and provide better control to your dominant hand. It will also keep the paper from moving around. Be sure you are practicing on a surface that has space to balance yourself with your other arm.\n\n\nThink about your dominant hand and position yourself in a way that gives you room to both balance and write.\n\n, The paper position ensures the correct slant of your letters. Your letters should ideally have a 35-degree slant.If you are right-handed, the bottom-left corner of the paper should be aligned with the top-right.\nIf you are left-handed, the top-left corner should be aligned with the bottom-right corner.\n\n, Keep your spine straight and be sure to have enough space to move your shoulder freely. Try to stay loose and not be too tense while writing. Find a comfortable hard-backed chair to sit on.Avoid sitting on a couch or a recliner.\n\n, It needs to feel comfortable to hold and move across the paper smoothly without requiring you to push it too hard on the paper. Depending on how elegant you want your handwriting to look, you may want to invest in different writing utensils.Fountain pens are believed to be the superior tool for handwriting. The expenses associated with a fountain pen are slightly higher due to the need to buy ink.\nMechanical pens and pencils are also great choice. They allow you to try out different sized nibs and thicknesses, as well as colors.\nIf you are left-handed, there are special pens designed just for you.\nFor those looking for a more rustic look, a quill might be worth looking into.\n\n, For practicing, you will want grid-lined paper because it will help you write lower and upper case letters, as well as track your progress. There are colored and raised papers for the visual perceptual challenged., If you have access to it, a drawing or drafting table is ideal for handwriting. Experts recommend writing at a 45-degree angle; however, a kitchen table or office desk will also work.Depending on the type of handwriting you are doing you might want to invest in a light box, which will help you write on paper without a grid., These workbooks have daily exercises to help you refine your writing. Depending on your skill level, there are also advanced books teach specific styles and scripts. You can take handwriting courses online and some tablets have tools that will help you practice your writing.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":629}
{"text":" Immediately after the officer gives you the written citation, make sure all the information is correct, including anything identifying you or describing your car.\n\n\nMissing or incorrect information on your ticket may be grounds for dismissal.It has to be significant, however. For example, if the officer says you have a navy blue BMW when you, in fact, have a black BMW, this probably is not a big enough difference to justify dismissal of your speeding ticket. If the officer writes the ticket for a red Honda Civic when you actually have a navy blue BMW, that's a different story.;\n, The officer will either check off or write down the exact sections of the city or state traffic code he claims you didn't follow.\n\n\nIf you don't understand what you did wrong, ask the officer on the scene before she leaves. You want to make sure you understand exactly why you were pulled over and why you're being given a ticket.\n\n, Typically the citation itself will have contact information for either paying your fine or disputing the ticket.\n\n, As soon as possible, make a record of the time of day when you were stopped, where you were stopped, what the weather was like, how much traffic was on the road, how long you were detained, and any other relevant information.\n\n\nSince many laws rely on subjective judgment, all of these details can help support your understanding of the situation. For example, in 20 states \u2013 including California, Texas, and Utah\u2013 speed limits are not absolute and you can make a judgment call as to whether it is safe to exceed the speed limit. Although you could still get a ticket, you could use circumstances from the time of the incident to argue you were operating your vehicle safely., If you had anyone in the car with you, or if there were people nearby who saw you get pulled over, find out if they're willing to make a statement on the record about what they saw.\n\n\nIf you have eyewitnesses who are willing to testify on your behalf, make sure you have their names and contact information before you leave the scene.\nPassengers or bystanders who will testify to your version of events can help you convince the judge that you were right and the police officer's observations were inaccurate., If the officer observed you from a different location before pulling you over, go there and take pictures of what he would have seen.\n\n\nThis is especially important if your case depends on an obstruction or other dangerous condition. For example, if you had to swerve to avoid a huge pothole and were pulled over and given a citation for an illegal lane change, photos of the pothole would support your argument that your actions were justified.\nYou can almost always argue that the officer was not in a good position to see what happened, especially if there are obstructions or if there was heavy traffic., If the officer's position that you violated the law is based on information provided by a piece of equipment, you will need to verify that the equipment was functioning properly.\n\n\nBefore you go to trial, request copies of maintenance records and schedules for any of that equipment. If the machines weren't calibrated or maintained according to industry standards, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed on the grounds that the officer's decision was based on unreliable information.\nFor example, most radar guns need to be re-calibrated either once a month or once every other month. If the gun was not calibrated, or if the officer did not check the calibration when he issued the ticket, you may be able to get your ticket dismissed., Make sure you have the officer's name, his badge number, and his patrol car number.\n\n\nIf the officer who issued your citation filed a report or made any notes about the traffic stop, you are entitled to copies of those as well.\n\n, Given the time and effort it would take to fight a traffic ticket, if the infraction is minor and the fine is small, you might be better off simply paying the fine and moving on with your life.\n\n, Although ignorance of the law is never an excuse, a legitimate and understandable mistake of a key fact may get you off the hook.For example, if you didn't stop at a crosswalk because the paint was so faded it was barely visible, the judge might cut you some slack. However, arguing that you didn't stop because you didn't know you were supposed to stop at a crosswalk won't help you.\n\n, Even though you technically violated a traffic ordinance, in some circumstances you must make an illegal maneuver to avoid something far more dangerous.For example, if you were swerving to avoid hitting an animal crossing the road, you might be able to get a ticket for an illegal lane change dismissed.\nHowever, keep in mind that you have to be able to prove that your version of events happened. If there was nobody else in your car who saw the animal and it's going to come down to your word against the word of the police officer, you're probably better off to simply pay the fine.\nYour own inattention or personal need aren't the same thing as avoiding harm. The harm you avoid must be something you didn't cause.For example, if you were having a fight with your sister on your cell phone and ran a red light, that argument would not excuse your actions in the event a police officer pulled you over and wrote you a ticket.\n\n, Find a copy of the code and break the section down into elements. If one of the elements is missing in your case, you can't be held liable.\n\n\nLook at the portions of the code where personal judgment come into play. Many traffic laws are not absolute and rely on the driver to make an honest assessment of what conduct is best given weather and highway conditions. For example, speed limits aren't absolute in more than a dozen states \u2013 this means that even if you get a ticket for exceeding the speed limit in those states, you can still make an argument that the speed at which you were traveling was safe given the totality of the circumstances.Nearly any violation that has the word \"unsafe\" in it implies a subjective judgment was made on the part of the police officer. Any time you are cited for an unsafe movement, the door is open for you to argue that from your position, your actions were in fact safe.If highway signs or signals figured into your citation, check them against the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, published by the Federal Highway Administration. The MUTCD is a compilation of national standards for all traffic control devices.If you can demonstrate that the relevant sign or signal didn't meet applicable standards, your ticket may be dismissed on those grounds.\n\n, Although you don't have the right to an appointed attorney, you may be able to hire a traffic attorney who can help you fight the ticket.\n\n, In many jurisdictions, you can attend traffic school and have a minor violation dismissed. Typically this option is only available for first-time offenders or for relatively minor infractions.\n\n\nIf it's your first ticket in the jurisdiction, you may be able to take a special \"no contest\" plea in which you pay a reduced fee and the violation doesn't add points to your license or go on your insurance., In many states you can have a trial by mail. You write a letter explaining why you shouldn't be held liable for the violation, and then the officer writes in with his side of the story. If the officer fails to write in, you win by default. However, if you lose by mail you can still request an in-person hearing., You may have automatically been assigned a hearing date, or your city may require you to request a hearing date. If you're responsible for requesting a hearing, do so as soon as possible after you get your ticket so you have a greater choice on dates and times.\n\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the police officer who issued your citation is required to show up at your hearing. If he does not appear, your ticket may be dismissed automatically.\nIf your ticket already has a date on it, consider having it changed. Typically the officer who issued your ticket already has that date in his schedule and plans to attend several hearings that day. If you have the date of your hearing changed, there's a greater possibility the officer won't show up.\nRequesting a continuance also may increase the chances that the officer isn't available to show up., Dress in clean, professional clothing and arrive early for your hearing. Bring copies of all documents along with any evidence or witnesses you wish to present.\n\n\nTreat all court staff with respect. If there are other cases being heard before yours, take a seat and wait your turn. When you are called to come forward, address the judge as \"your honor\" and don't speak unless you are asked a question.\u2028\nLeave your mobile phone or any other electronic devices at home or in the car \u2013 don't try to bring them with you into the courtroom.\nOrganize your documents and evidence before you get there so you aren't shuffling through papers if the judge asks for something.\n\n, When the judge calls on you, explain briefly why you are not liable for the traffic violation. Keep your argument succinct and stick to the facts.\n\n\nIf you've brought witnesses to testify on your behalf, keep your questions brief and make sure they stay in line with what you're trying to prove rather than digressing., You can make notes if there's something you want to ask her about. But don't interrupt her or argue with her.\n\n\nDon't insult the police officer or accuse her of lying. If it comes down to an argument between you and the police officer without any factual evidence, the judge probably will believe the police officer.\n\n, After the officer has finished her testimony, the judge will give you an opportunity to ask her questions.\n\n\nYou want to establish some doubt in the officer's mind, as well as in the judge's mind. The officer may have walked into that courtroom absolutely convinced that she was correct in giving you a ticket, but if you can place doubt in her mind she may become less sure of herself. If the officer isn't entirely sure, the judge won't be sure either, and might dismiss your ticket.\nCreate uncertainty in the officer's mind by challenging her subjective conclusions. Police officers often don't know the exact wording or interpretation of a law. The officer who pulled you over may not have realized that she has to make a judgment call every time she writes a ticket for violating a law that requires safe or responsible vehicle operation.Ask the officer how she came to the conclusion that your driving was unsafe or irresponsible, and then provide her with evidence she didn't have at the time.\nFor example, suppose she gave you a ticket for an unsafe lane change. She only saw you swerve erratically into the left lane and then back into the right; however, she didn't see the deer crossing the road that you swerved to avoid. This information might change her judgment, since it would be safer for you to swerve than to hit the deer.\nYou also can impeach the officer's testimony by challenging her observations.This is why you talked to witnesses and took photos of the scene.\nFor example, suppose you ask the officer to describe the weather conditions when she pulled you over, and she says it was bright and sunny. If you have a photo showing that the conditions actually were gray and cloudy, use it to cast doubt on her observations. When she later says she's certain your car was the one that was speeding, you get the opportunity to ask her how certain she is \u2013 as certain as she was that it was bright and sunny?\n\n, After both sides have presented all evidence, the judge will decide if you are liable for the violation or not.\n\n\nIf the judge rules against you and you decide you want to appeal, ask the court clerk for information on the appeals process.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":630}

There is a presser bar lever located in one of these positions.;\n, Raise the needle to its highest position., These are usually two plastic pins located on the top or near the base that hold your spools of thread. Locate the stool pins and remove them.\n\n, Insert the spool pin on top of the spool. It is required to keep the spool pins in place.\n\n\nYou only need two spools of thread if you are using two needles.\n\n, Draw out a foot of extra thread with which you will thread the upper portion of the machine. Cut the end of the thread so that it is easier to thread through the needle.\n\n, Bring the thread through the first hole and pull it through the partial hole on the other side. It should be threaded from the bottom through the top of the partial hole and then stretched downward.\n\n, If you are threading two spools of thread, the first one should pass through the right side of the upper thread tension disk and the back spool should thread through the left side of the upper thread tension disk. They will attach to two different needles.\n\n, It should catch on the thread guide lightly as you pull it through and continue downward.\n\n, Then, pass the end of the thread through the eye of the needle.

{"text":" Anywhere between 6 and 8 weeks is the shortest duration you should attempt for a weight loss challenge. Shorter challenges will have the least drastic results in the end, but they can also be the most productive because there\u2019s a slight sense of urgency throughout the competition.Between 8 and 10 weeks is the most commonly used time frame for a weight loss challenge. Give the challenge a catchy name that references the duration of the event, like the \u201c10-Week Lifestyle Reboot\u201d or something else similarly motivating.12 weeks should be the maximum duration for a weight loss challenge. After 12 weeks people may start to lose interest in the competition or drop out because it\u2019s too strenuous.;\n, The recommended and safest rate of weight loss is approximately 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) per week.On average, you need to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more than you consume each day, by way of diet and exercise, to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week. This is a realistic goal that everyone can shoot for.\n\n\nAs host of the competition, it will be your responsibility to convey to the participants that ultimately the contest is about health, not weight.\nCaution your participants about using extreme measures and unhealthy methods to lose weight, and warn them about the dangers of losing too much weight too quickly. When you host the first meeting, provide literature about healthy weight loss strategies, along with quality information about diet and exercise for safe weight loss.\nEmphasize that they should use diet and exercise to lose weight, not starve themselves. State clearly and kindly that you'll have to privately intervene if you notice anyone who starts shedding weight inexplicably fast or starts to look unhealthy during the contest and that it could result in their disqualification.\n\n, Most challenges measure success by pounds lost, and this method will be easiest for you to measure. Providing the data in pounds lost will also more straightforward for the participants. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by calculating the highest percentage of weight loss over the time period of the challenge.\n\n\nRecord each participant\u2019s weight every week, and on the final day of the competition you will get the average of those weekly weigh-ins and subtract that number from the participant\u2019s start weight.\nThe objective is to reveal who showed the most improvement over the course of the contest, measured by percentage of weight loss.Sometimes weight loss challenges will measure success by body fat percentage instead of pounds lost. Both methods of measurement are effective, but it may be easier to measure body fat percentages accurately if you have a personal trainer or fitness expert involved in the competition.\n\n, Working in teams can be a lot more fun (and effective) for everyone involved. If you decide to do teams, the process will be slightly different. Create small groups of 2 to 6 people, with one of them acting as team captain. Success will be measured by total percentage lost by the group rather than individually.\n\n\nThe weigh-ins will work the same as with individual play, except that the team captain will record everyone's weights and submit them each week.\nThe captain will also be responsible for making sure everyone in the group makes the weigh-ins and for team support in general.\n\n, Make it something affordable, like $25 or $50 per person. The collected amount can fund the cash prize for the winner and also cover any expenses associated with the competition, such as T-shirts or planning a post-challenge party to celebrate everyone\u2019s success.\n\n\nIf you decide to require an entry fee, task one person with being in charge of the funds throughout the challenge. Keep the money in a secure place, like in a lock box or safe, and make sure that all expenses are well-documented.\nSkip the entree fee requirement if you think it will discourage others from participating in the challenge.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure, send out an email to announce the competition. Get a feel for who is interested in competing and then poll those people about what amount would be fair and affordable to charge as an entry fee.\n\n, Usually the reward is the cash prize generated from the collected entry fees (minus any expenses). You could also offer prizes like laptops, iPads, or gift certificates, if you have that capability.\n\n\nIf you are holding the challenge for colleagues at your place of employment, ask your employer to sponsor the event and provide prizes for the competition.\nYou\u2019ll need to decide if the winner takes all, or if you plan to have first and second place winners in the competition. A winner-takes-all prize is certainly more of an incentive for the participants, but if you have several generous prizes planned, it would make sense to have first and second place winners.\n\n, Supply someone in management with all of the challenge information and guidelines. Additionally, you should speak with someone in the Human Resources department about the contest. When announced, it should be stressed that participation is completely optional.\n\n\nEnlist the HR department's help in announcing the contest, as well as monitoring employees for any unsafe or negative behavior. Consider having the HR department speak to everyone as a group about safety. Since crash diets can affect work performance, HR will need to help monitor the staff for any behavioral or performance changes.\nIf anyone on staff is uncomfortable with the contest because of past (or current) eating disorders, or for any other reason, let the group know when the contest is announced that the employee should speak to the HR department privately about it. If there are any major protests or problems reported, have HR help you shut down the competition.\nWait for the official go-ahead from management and Human Resources before announcing anything about the competition to your colleagues.\nSince the challenge will encourage employees to be healthier, find out if your employer would be willing to help cover expenses and provide the cash prize.\n\n, Whether you're setting up the competition for your friends, family, or colleagues, a successful challenge requires active and engaged participants. Establish who you want to recruit and announce the competition via email.\n\n\nCreate fliers, emails, a Facebook group and, if possible, provide a website where people can get more information and sign up to participate.\n\n, Consider calling it a Wellness Competition rather than a Weight Loss Competition, to put the emphasis on health rather than weight loss. Promote the competition with vocabulary and imagery that is health-oriented and not completely weight-focused.\n\n, Along with announcing the competition prizes, try upping the stakes. Have each participating person or team choose their favorite charity or community outreach program and offer to award a portion (or even all) of the prize money to the chosen beneficiary.\n\n\nIf you are organizing the challenge among coworkers, ask if your company will match the donation.\n\n, Recruit local health and wellness professionals to provide informal seminars throughout the challenge on subjects related to fitness, well-being and weight loss.\n\n\nInvite a local chef to demonstrate healthy cooking and provide recipes.\nVisit personal trainers and gyms in your area to see if they would like to offer their services or become involved in the challenge in some way.\n\n, Create well-defined policies for all components of the challenge and provide this information to the participants in document form. Additionally, post the contest rules on the challenge website and make them available through social media. Detail the prizes and any other important information that relates specifically to the contest.\n\n\nMake sure to include all important dates, the rules for entry, and the procedure for how measurements will be taken.\nDon\u2019t forget to include any prohibited activities that could result in disqualification, such as taking weight loss supplements or engaging in unsafe weight-loss strategies.\nIf you are organizing the competition at work, ask management to sign off on the policies and procedures. Make sure that the Human Resources department reviews all of the information, and enlist their help for monitoring the staff for any red flags.\n\n, Arrange a space for this purpose and have the entire process organized prior to announcing the contest. Taking measurements can be done as simply as using a bathroom scale to record the participants\u2019 weight, or you could plan to have a personal trainer or health professional weigh-in participants and take body fat measurements.\n\n\nThe most accurate way to track weight loss is by setting a routine day and time (preferably in the morning before breakfast) each week to record the measurements.Network with local community experts, such as personal trainers and nutritionists, and offer them the opportunity to make new contacts or give talks in exchange for taking measurements.\n\n, Set this date in stone and establish a deadline for entries, so that the challenge follows a strict and manageable timeline. Announce the meeting time and place for the initial weigh-in and answer any questions about the process.\n\n\nReassure the participants that all weight information will be kept confidential.\n\n, Consulting a physician before embarking on a new health routine is a good habit for everyone to get into and setting that standard lends a professional quality to your challenge.\n\n\nIt also emphasizes that good health is more important than any weight that might be lost in a competition.\nIf you want total peace of mind about the health of your participants, you could even make this a requirement upon entry.\n\n, Have the participants come in to be weighed and record everyone\u2019s starting weight using whatever method you established at the introductory meeting. Use a systematized method, such as a spreadsheet, to record the name and starting weight of each participant.\n\n\nMake sure that everyone knows the dates and times for the weekly weigh-ins for the remaining duration of the challenge.\nIf desired, you could photograph each participant at the initial weigh-in and plan to do the same at the final weigh-in. You could then provide your participants with a before and after snapshot to document their success.\n\n, Each week, after everyone has weighed in, send out an encouraging email to all the participants. You can keep the participants updated on who\u2019s in the lead throughout the competition, or simply offer motivation and encouraging words to keep everyone engaged in the challenge.\n\n\nAdditionally, try sending out group emails throughout the duration of the challenge that provide a steady stream of healthy weight-loss tips, recipes, resources and encouragement to your group.\n\n, Create opportunities for the participants to get together periodically during the challenge. This gives everyone a chance to meet face-to-face to support one another and share their weight-loss experiences while also fostering a sense of community among the competitors.\n\n\nYou can also use these mini-events as opportunities to gauge and maintain everyone\u2019s interest and enthusiasm in the challenge.\nMid-challenge events could be almost anything that you think would pique the interest of your participants. Offering a complimentary yoga class, hosting a fun run, and inviting everyone to a healthy pot-luck picnic at your local park are all great examples of motivational events.\n\n, Encourage them to share their personal diet and exercise tips there, as well as their experiences and progress photos. Promote a sense of community rather than focusing solely on the competitive element of the challenge.\n\n\nIf possible, provide a way for the participants to receive feedback and support and frequently share resources like weight loss websites and health forums with the group.\n\n, On the day the competition ends, have everyone come in for their final weigh-in. Hold the meeting first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, since that\u2019s the best time to gauge everyone\u2019s most accurate weight.Meticulously record everyone\u2019s final weight and plug the numbers into your spreadsheet.\n\n\nOffer a simple, healthy assortment of breakfast foods for your participants to enjoy after their final weigh-in.\nLet everyone know how and when you will be revealing the results of the challenge. You could host an announcement party at lunchtime that day or soon after, so that the participants don\u2019t have to wait too long to hear the news.\n\n, For each participant, calculate the average of their weekly weigh-ins. Subtract that number from each participant\u2019s starting weight, and this will give you a very precise measure of how much progress each person made.\n\n, Gather everyone together and reveal the winner. Provide each participant with individual progress reports that show the data you collected during the competition to highlight their individual successes.\n\n\nCalculate the total overall weight lost by the group and announce that number, as well, congratulating the group on their collective success.\nThank everyone for their participation and encourage them to continue the healthy habits they\u2019ve established during the challenge.\nSend out a group email that details all of this information, so that anyone who couldn\u2019t attend the announcement will know who won. You could send out the progress reports individually via email, as well.\n\n, After the winner is announced, make sure everyone sticks around for a mini-celebration. Cater the event with healthy food options and provide weight-loss literature and resources that the participants can take away with them.\n\n\nKeep the atmosphere positive and emphasize that everyone was successful, even if only one winner was chosen.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":632}

{"text":" Do you want him or her to change for you? And if so, consider that it would be fair for your partner to want you to change for them as well. Another thing you can try is to fully accept whatever it is you want them to change. Say it aloud: \"I accept that he\/she is a total slob.\" Then ask yourself: Do the benefits of the relationship outweigh that fact? If so, try accepting and dealing with your partner as they are, rather than trying to change them.\n\n\nIf this is something so big or bothersome that you simply can't get over it and the person won't change, then it may be time to end the relationship.\nMaybe you and your partner come from different religious backgrounds. If your partner refuses to convert and so do you and religion is very important to you, then this may indeed be a deal breaker for you.;\n, You may discover that you want to break up because you don't want to face certain issues in yourself, like insecurity or fear of abandonment, but they are sure to turn up in any relationship you're in. For example, maybe you've been cheated on before, and you're tempted to break up with this person before you get too attached and become vulnerable to being deeply hurt again. That's not a good reason to break up. You need to address your fears, rather than run away from them.\n\n\nIf you think your issues are the problem, then talk to your partner about them and see if you can find a way to work through them together.\n\n, If you're the kind of person who's used to looking out for everyone else's needs, maybe deep down you know you don't want to be in this relationship, but you're scared of telling the person it's over. You have to realize, however, that you're not doing this person any favors by staying with them out of sympathy. Reading How to Stop Being a People Pleaser might help.\n\n\nIf you know that the relationship has no real future for you, then ending it as quickly as possible will be the best thing you can do for your partner, because you'll be giving him or her the chance to heal and find a more fitting relationship in the future.\nThough it's ideal to end the relationship during a calm time, don't keep holding off because of a birthday, a wedding, Valentine's Day, Christmas with your family, or a million other reasons that would make it \"inconvenient\" to be broken up. This can go on forever and there is no perfect time to end a relationship (though some are, of course, better than others).\n\n, Are you scared of being single? Another reason sometimes people are reluctant to end a relationship is because they don't want to be alone. But staying with someone as a \"placeholder\" is not only unfair to them, but also unfair to yourself, because then you're less likely to develop as an individual and find the right person for you. Read How to Enjoy Being Single and How to Be Optimistic for encouragement.\n\n, Or, maybe they're just not all that into you. No one knows exactly why we like or love the people we do. Sometimes we just don't connect. Or sometimes one person develops strong feelings, and the other doesn't. It happens. And it hurts, but it's not anyone's fault. Affection and love can't be forced. You might have been madly in love at some point, but how long ago was that? The sooner you admit how you really feel, the sooner you can do something about it.\n\n, Spend some time sitting alone with your eyes closed, focusing on your breath. Though this may not lead to an epiphany about what you should do about your relationship, it can help you feel centered and more in touch with your thoughts. You may be too busy panicking that you haven't had a moment to sit down and really listen to what your mind and body are telling you.\n\n, This is an important point. If your work or group of friends are having a happy hour, are you excited to bring along your significant other because you know how awesome he or she is, or do you make excuses for not bringing that person around because you hate bringing him or her out in social situations?\n\n\nSure, some people are more shy than others and some situations can be more fun without your significant other, but generally, you should be proud of the person you're with and feel excited to show him off. If you're not happy about other people seeing you with that person, then how can you be happy in the relationship?\n\n, This kind of relationship is unhealthy. In order for the relationship to survive, the manipulative partner would need to dramatically change his or her behavior. If he or she won't, or can't, it would be wise to end it as soon as possible. If you feel like your partner is running everything you do and threatening you if you want to act independently, then you have a major problem.\n\n\nIf you are being manipulated or controlled, then this is one of the rare cases where you may not want to break up with the person face-to-face; if you're afraid of a violent reaction if you end the relationship, do it from a distance and have a friend help you pick up the pieces.\n\n, If your significant other really cares about you, then he or she isn't going to demean you or be critical of you for no reason. If the person gives you constructive feedback to help you grow as a person that's one thing, but if the person is intentionally malicious, that's another. For example, if you drop and break something and your partner says something like, \"You are an idiot, why don't you look at what you are doing for once in your life?\" then that right there should be more than a sign that you need to leave that person and move on to somebody that will take better care of you.\n\n\nYour partner's lack of respect may be more subtle. Maybe the person pokes fun at certain aspects of your looks, makes jabs about your career, or hints that you're not very good at something. That's still disrespect -- big time.\n\n, It's okay to fight now and again, and fighting can even be healthy for a relationship once in a while if it helps you discuss your frustrations in a constructive manner. However, if your partner is always yelling at you, disagreeing with you, calling you names, and generally being cruel to you for no reason, then it's time to get out.\n\n, This is a huge red flag. If your partner is embarrassed to bring you around or even to say that you two are dating, then you have a major problem. There are few good reasons for the person to hide your love, unless the person is too young to date or has a good reason to hide the relationship from overbearing parents. But if the person wants to keep it a secret from your friends or acquaintances or refuses to hold your hand or look like you're dating in public, then it may be time to end the relationship. You want to be with someone who is proud, not ashamed, to be with you, because that's what you deserve.\n\n, If you are having a cuddling session, but you are the one that needs to start it off or try to spice things up almost every time, then you may be in trouble. Especially if you are going for the hello or goodbye kiss and you ask the person to kiss you, then there may be some real issues in the relationship. Don't be afraid to talk about it; maybe your partner has intimacy issues or doesn't want to touch you because you cheated. Whatever the problem is, you need to work on it or end things, because the status quo is not working.\n\n, If they make you drink when you don't want to, have sex when you aren't ready, or even engage in reckless behavior like speeding, harassing strangers, or generally conducting yourself in a way that makes you scared, then it's time to end the relationship. The person does not value your wants and needs and you can find someone who actually cares for you.\n\n\nIt may take you a minute to realize that you have been doing something that you were not comfortable with, because you were just trying to get in the swing of things.\n\n, Though you shouldn't end your relationship just because your best friend vaguely thinks you can \"do better,\" you should reconsider your relationship if all of your friends, family members, or even people you barely know go out of their way to tell you to get out of the relationship as soon as you can. If they have concrete reasons, like that the person really doesn't like you or treats you like a rag doll, then that's even more indicative of the fact that it's time to break up.\n\n\nOf course, people may not understand how your relationship works and you can't go around basing the quality of your relationship on whether other people like the two of you together. But if everyone is telling you to get out, you should at least consider that they have a good reason for doing so.\n\n, Your relationship should grow at its own pace and you should take the time to get to know each other. If you just met your partner two months ago and you're already talking about moving in together or getting married, then you may both be obsessed with the idea of commitment, but not each other. If you feel like you're in over your head with the relationship without ever even taking the time to get to know the person you're in the relationship with, then you need to slow down or stop.\n\n, Okay, so if you're fifteen, it's okay to never bring up marriage, moving, where you see your careers, if you want to have kids, etc, but if you're twenty-five or thirty-five or have been dating for several years, then the subject of the future should come up eventually and naturally. If you have been together for a long time and neither of you mentions anything more than a month in the future, then chances are it's because you don't see each other being a couple in the long-term. If this is the case, then you have to think about whether the relationship is worth pursuing at all.\n\n, Though a series of less-serious signs can also indicate the need for a break-up, there are some signs that almost always indicate that you either need to end your relationship or seriously change your tune. If these signs apply to you, then it may be time to break-up:\n\n\nYou've suffered physical and\/or psychological abuse, financial exploitation, sexual abuse or degradation from your partner past the point of damage to your health and safety.\nYour partner constantly pressures you to do something you're not comfortable with, such as being part of a dangerous or criminal activity. Harsh ultimatums and threatening statements that create pressure to are all signs of a potentially dangerous relationship. Don't fall for the \"If you really love me, you'd do this...\" trick.\nEndless strife or despair has taken over the major areas of couple functioning \u2013 communication, sex, finances and emotional support.\nJealousy becomes a major issue. A relationship becomes unhealthy if your partner tries to put restrictions on who you hang out with, when, and for how long. Your partner is not in control of your social life; you are.\nYour partner has been involved in long-term alcohol or drug abuse\/addiction that they can't break free from and your life, or your childrens' lives, have suffered markedly because of it.\nYou are involved in long-term alcohol or drug addiction that you can't break free from. You aren't doing anyone any good by staying in the relationship.\nYour relationship was based on superficial foundations that no longer work, such as partying, shared hobbies, or sex without love, and you are ready to move beyond these things.\nYour partner tries to control what you wear and how you look. It is your body, your face, your hair, and your wardrobe; you decide what to do with it.\n\n, A true loving partner should be loving all the time no matter what the situation is so, if your relationship is on and off, then it's time to leave because there is something wrong. Do not go back and fix the relationship because you are better without the headache as well as the heartache, and there are others that are waiting for you go find them.\n\n, If you see yourself as a marine biologist who will travel the world and your partner wants to be a teacher and to live in Texas near her family all of her life, then you have a problem. If you don't want to have kids and she wants to have seven and to get started yesterday, then you have a problem. If your dreams and visions of the future really don't line up -- and you have to figure out your next steps soon -- then it's time to get out.\n\n\nIf you're still a teenager, then yeah, your life goals may change and you have time to think it over. But if you need to start planning for your futures now and there's no possible intersection, then it may be time to rethink the relationship.\n\n, Cheating is never a good sign, whether you have a history of cheating or are cheating because you're unhappy in the relationship. Though you can learn to forgive each other, if it's a repeated thing, then chances are that too much damage has been done for your relationship to recover. This may be your way of sending each other a message that your relationship just isn't enough.\n\n, This is a hard one. You may have really loved each other when you were in high school or college, but now you find that you're just completely different people with different friends, dreams, and interests. If you find that the only thing you have in common is your shared history, and that it isn't enough, then it may be time to move on. This is one of the hardest reasons for a break-up, because it isn't anyone's fault, and you both must still have a lot of affection for each other, but that doesn't mean you should stay together if it's not right for the people you are today.\n\n, Any form of secrets or deception, even if you haven't gone as far as cheating, is a red flag that says that there's no trust or honor in the relationship. You shouldn't hide anything bigger than a surprise party from your significant other. This is different from not sharing your latest complaints about work with your significant other because you know it'll bore her; it's more like hiding the fact that you're interviewing for a job in a different state because you don't know what you'll do if you get it.\n\n, If you used to go on romantic picnics, hikes, plan elaborate dates, and take care of each other when you were feeling sick, but now you can barely make the effort to pick up your phone and answer your significant other's text message, then you need to put in more effort or end the relationship. If you or your partner just aren't trying any more, then you must feel that the relationship is not worth it, deep down.\n\n, Maybe you and your significant other have already unofficially broken up without doing the dirty work. If you spend most of your weekends with separate friends, visiting your families alone, or just staying in and pursuing your own hobbies instead of hanging out together -- think of watching two different televisions in two different rooms -- then you may be already drifting apart without having the big talk. If this is the case, then it may be time for a break up.\n\n, If the relationship is not worth saving, you will be able to see that when both of you are calm. Additionally, breaking up out of anger can make it very difficult to find closure. Make sure you're feeling rational and have taken some time to really think about it before you have \"the talk.\"\n\n, Agree to not see each other for a week or two, and be sure to clarify that you are still together and your relationship will remain exclusive during this time. Don't spend time together, don't talk on the phone, don't send each other messages. This trial separation might help you see how much you value the relationship...or don't. If it's difficult at first, but if you find yourself at peace without this person in your life, breaking up is probably a good idea.\n\n\nIf you enjoy the first few days but then find yourself missing this person and feeling like your life is incomplete without them, you should probably try to repair the relationship. See more details in How to Give Each Other Space.\n\n, If you've taken the time to think about whether or not you should end the relationship, then you can see if the signs of a good relationship apply to you, too. Here are some signs that you should fight to stay with the person you're with, even if it means that you have to take some drastic changes:\n\n\nThere is a core foundation of similar values and beliefs that you share, especially spiritual and moral values.\nYou still trust each other; you know your partner is on your side and have faith they will work with you for the greater good of your household.\nHard times have taken over suddenly without giving you time to find your center. Health problems, trauma, financial problems, addiction regressions and depression can come on in an instant and make things look really dark. Give it time, let the smoke clear, and try to be a friend to each other until it's over.\nYou are caught in a negative response cycle where negative behavior triggers more negative behavior. Break the cycle by gaining control of your own negative reactions, call for a peace treaty, and give your partner time to get a handle on their negativity.\nYou have a tendency to run from commitment at the first sign of trouble. Take some time to cool down and work to become friends again. Commit to friendship, remember what you used to like about your partner, and act like you care. It's good for you to see if you can stick through the problems for once, no matter how it ends up.\nYou have drifted apart slowly and suddenly discover you are living with a stranger. This generally happens due to neglect, so work on it - talk, listen, spend time together and see if you can rediscover love.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":635}
{"text":" The more information you are able to provide about your financial status, the easier it will be to maneuver through the mortgage application process. Collect a list of information about your debts and assets and print out a summary that you can show to lenders.\n\n\nGet an updated credit report. Take care of details that are not correct and pay outstanding debts as much as you can. This will increase your credit score and allow you to get better interest rates.Make a list of your debts. Include balances owed and account numbers. You'll need this information when you fill out a loan application.\nPut together a list of all your assets. This should include both checking and savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and any personal property you own (like cars or boats).;\n, There are some basic loan terms that are simple to understand but may be confusing at first to borrowers who are unfamiliar with them. Learn a few of the basic terms so that you understand what your lender is talking about and know what to look for. Your lender should also be able to explain these terms and any other, more complex terms that may show up. For now, start with the following terms:\n\n\nAnnual percentage rate (APR). This is the annual interest rate charged on the loan.\nLender fees. These are additional fees (on top of interest) that are paid to the lender at closing.\nLoan program. This is the general type of mortgage that describes the interest rates and length of the loan's life. Some common loan programs include 15-year fixed mortgage rate or 30-year adjustment rate mortgage (ARM).\n\"Good Faith\" estimate. This is the initial, pre-approval set of loan terms given to you by a lender. It includes the interest rate and any additional fees that will be charged., It will be difficult to find the right lender if you don't know what kind of mortgage you are looking for. For example, think about how quickly you want to pay off your mortgage. The lives of these loans can vary widely in length, so make sure you know what your plan is. Just make sure to consider that paying off the loan in a shorter time will result in higher monthly payments (but less overall interest paid)., Think about specifically what you want to know when applying for a mortgage loan. For example, consider asking what monthly payments would be under a variety of different loan terms. Or, you could ask why certain fees are charged. You can ask any number of things of your lender without even applying for loan, so ask as many questions as you need to. If your lender doesn't take the time to respond to them or is difficult to reach, you may want to seek other lenders.Keep the questions consistent between lenders so you have a standard of comparison.\nAsk about special mortgage loans if you think you qualify for them.Special loan programs include VA loans (for veterans of the armed forces), USDA loans (for rural areas), and programs offered by state or local governments. These programs may offer borrowers lower rate or better repayment terms., The first lender you find may not have the best loan package. You should take advantage of any connections you have that can refer you to a reputable mortgage lender.\n\n\nCall your current mortgage lender or bank, if you've had a good experience with them in the past. Being a return customer may give you some leverage with negotiations.\nSearch the Internet financial sections for mortgage interest rates.\nTalk to friends for recommendations.\nTake recommendations from real estate professionals for mortgage lenders they've had a good working relationship with., Don't be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand the type of loans they're proposing.\n\n\nFor example, you should always ask for the specific interest rate charged on each loan duration. This is also known as the annual percentage rate (APR).\nAdditionally, you should ask whether the stated interest rate on each loan is fixed (non-changing) or adjustable (changing)., Get interest rates for various different types of loans and loan durations from each lender so that you can compare these different loan types between them. This also will be helpful if you change your mind about the loan duration you want.\n\n\nFor example, imagine you are considering either a 15 year or a 30 year loan. You ask for rate estimates from two lenders. The first offers you a 15 year loan at 3.1 percent and a 30 year estimate of 3.8 percent. The second offers rates of 3.2 and 3.7 percent, respectively. You would then see that the first lender offered a better rate for the 15 year loan but was not as good of a choice for the 30 year loan., This statement is a \"Good Faith Estimate.\" Most reputable mortgage lenders will offer to provide this for you.\n\n\nMake sure the Good Faith Estimate includes costs for all points, processing, legal fees, filing and closing fees.\nYou can also have the lender email or fax this estimate to you as a backup., Access the National Mortgage Licensing System & Registry (NMLS) to determine whether or not each of your mortgage lenders are licensed in your state. Immediately eliminate from the list those lenders that do not show up on this website. The NMLS can be accessed at http:\/\/www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org., How a lender acted when you met with them can say a lot about how doing business with them will be later. Look for lenders who were helpful, professional, and willing to answer any questions you had. Did the lender stick to the interest rate they quoted over the phone or online? Do they set forth a timeline for progressing with your loan application (when to lock in rates, etc.)? Eliminate any lenders that seemed shady in any way.Also, pass on the mortgage lenders that did not provide clear written information.\n\n, Search for each lender online to locate reviews of that lender. There should be sources like Zillow.com and Google local reviews that show up when you search for the lender. Look for higher scores and watch out for any problems other borrowers have run into with that lender., Lenders may be able to waive or lower some of the fees, even those that they originally try to argue are \"necessary.\" For example, you should try to negotiate down the application fee to free or near free, if possible. Additionally, the appraisal fee is a necessary fee, but only if it is within reasonable bounds; you should negotiate down an appraisal fee that is over $400. If you are using a broker to get your loan, you may also be able to negotiate down origination fees and underwriting fees.\n\n\nSome fees are always non-negotiable. These include recording fees, title insurance, tax-related fees, document stamp fees, and title fees.You may also be able to negotiate discount points down. However, these are essentially a form of prepaid interest on the house, so you gain nothing in the long run by avoiding this expense now.\nFor example, you might be able to pay $2,000 to reduce your interest rate by 0.25 percent. This would save you money by reducing your monthly payment by a small amount each month, and would add up over the life of your loan., The lowest rate is not necessarily the best option if there are thousands of dollars more in fees and expenses than a slightly higher interest rate loan.\n\n\nFor example, you will be charged an origination fee on your loan. This is a percentage of the total value of the loan and is usually around one percent. If you were offered two loans with the same interest rate of 4.5 percent, but the first charges a 1.5 percent origination fee compared to the second's one percent origination fee, you would be better off choosing the second loan., Compare your lenders' offered interest rates and fees structures for the type of loan you are seeking. Obviously, you should go with the reputable lender that offers you the cheapest combination of interest rates and fees.\n\n\nUnderstand each loan type the mortgage lender is offering. There's a great deal of difference in a 30-year fixed-rate and a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), mainly that the interest rate in the ARM stands to change unexpectedly. Know the difference and feel confident in the explanation provided by the mortgage lender., Ask them to lock in the interest rate and fees you've negotiated and draw up a contract. Make sure to ask if your good faith estimate rates and fee structure still stand., Make sure you look at the fine print to ensure that you are getting the loan terms and fees that you have negotiated. Pay special attention to what happens if the loan doesn't go through. It is a serious red flag if the \"good faith\" or \"earnest money\" deposit you give the lender in advance is kept by the lender in the event that the loan doesn't go through.\n\n\nAgain, ask for an explanation if there are any unexpected fees or confusingly worded statements in the contract.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":636}

{"text":" Buy a brand new journal and use it only for career-related entries. Have it with you when you conduct career research. Makes notes not only about the information you locate during your research, but you personal thoughts and feelings about what you\u2019ve found. Write down questions that arise while doing your research and work to get answers for them. Practice job interview questions and answers. Makes notes about things that went well and didn\u2019t go well in interviews. Your career journal can be as structured or carefree as you want. There are no set rules as to what it should or should not contain. Allow it to reflect your personality so you\u2019ll feel comfortable writing in it on a regular basis.;\n, There are many places you can go to research different types of jobs and careers, including your guidance counsellor, a university career center, a career coaches and websites, government websites, journals and magazines, newspapers, blogs, books, and more. Start by selecting one or two of these options and investigate the details regarding a career in medicine, specifically oncology.\n\n\nLearn about the details of what the job does, what type of work environment they have, educational requirements, potential pay ranges, and even what the future job market may look like.Read the advice and opinions of people who are already medical doctors and oncologists, possibly via personal blogs or a day in the life of articles.Record your findings, ideas and questions in your career journal.\n\n, All major hospitals and medical clinics will have formal volunteer programs. Contact the volunteer coordinator and determine the application process. Apply for a volunteer position. Focus on departments or organizations related to oncology.\n\n\nConsider volunteering for a local cancer charity event, like a marathon, golf tournament, or daffodil days.Use the opportunity to speak with cancer patients and their families.\nConsider volunteering at a camp for children with cancer.Use the opportunity not only to make the kid\u2019s happy, but to see how the disease affects children and the potential you have to help them in the future.\nWhile volunteering think about what it would be like to be in a similar environment on a regular basis. What sorts of things bother you? Can you overcome them? Do you find it emotionally difficult to deal with the patients? Use this as a learning experience to help assess if oncology is still the right career goal for you.\n\n, You will definitely have the opportunity to do something like this while in medical school, but you may want to complete a job shadow at least once before medical school to gain a better understanding of what an oncologist does on a daily basis. Some hospitals may have formal job shadowing programs, but you can also reach out personally to a department or doctor to request a job shadow.The volunteer program at a hospital, or the career center at a medical school, may be able to recommend a specific oncologist to contact directly. Or they may be able to provide you with a formal process to follow to sign up.\nBring your career journal with you to take notes. As a job shadower, you\u2019re there to observe, not necessarily participate. Watch what goes on and write down your questions, ideas and observations.\nOnce the doctor is finished with his\/her patients, go over your questions with them. There are no bad questions.\nDress appropriately. If you\u2019re in a hospital setting you\u2019ll probably be on your feet for a long time, so make sure you\u2019re comfortable. But also dress professionally as you want to project a respectful image to both the doctor and the patients.\nWrite about your experiences in your career journal.\nSend the doctor you shadowed, and anyone else who helped make it happen, a thank you card afterwards. Maybe throw in a coffee gift card too - no doubt every doctor would appreciate coffee!\nBe very respectful of the patients. Information you learn that is of a personal nature will be confidential and you should not talk about it with anyone other than the doctor your shadowing. Do not assume every patient is going to want you around, allow the doctor to introduce you and if the patient is uncomfortable, wait outside the room.\n\n, A mentor is someone who is an experienced oncologist who has agreed to advise and counsel you about oncology and an oncology career.You may not be able to obtain a mentor such as this until your internship or residency as a mentee really should be pursuing the career already.\n\n\nFormal mentoring programs do exist. If your medical school or hospital has one, definitely take advantage of it. If they don\u2019t, actively seek out a mentor informally by becoming involved with the work of an oncologist you admire.Use your career journal to make notes of your observations, ideas and questions.\n\n, Remember to look at your career journal on a regular basis. Determine if you have any outstanding questions you'd like answered - and get them answered. Write down any new thoughts and ideas that have come to mind since the last time you wrote in your journal. Keep track of any experiences you've had that are career-related, even if they aren't specifically related to medicine. Reevaluate your career goals and\/or plans if you feel they've changed., Most universities do not have formal pre-med programs. And in fact, medical schools, in general, do not require a specific undergraduate degree in order to apply. As harsh as it sounds, medical schools are more interested in your overall GPA and your MCAT score. Therefore, your goal in choosing an undergraduate program should be that it helps you achieve the highest GPA and MCAT scores possible.Review pre-med program rankings. There are many organizations that rank colleges and universities in different ways, including what schools have the best pre-med program. While you certainly don\u2019t need to apply to the best, if you can, you should.When selecting a program consider the following: Does the program prepare me properly for the MCAT? Does the program maximize my chances of getting the best GPA possible? Does the program help me obtain another career if I don\u2019t end up in medical school? Does the program help me in medical school?Your undergraduate program doesn\u2019t have to be in biology, or even science. If you can get better grades by completing an undergraduate humanities degree, go for it.\nUse the Association of American Medical College\u2019s (AAMC) Pre-Med Coursework Worksheet to select a program that will allow you to complete all the course requirements.\n\n, If you\u2019ve selected your program based on school rankings, skip this step. Once you\u2019ve figured out what type of degree program you want to pursue, you now have to find a place to pursue it. Determine if you have any specific restrictions that limit your choices - i.e. financial, geographical, etc. Eliminate any schools do not offer the program you want, or include the restrictions you\u2019ve identified.Make a list of all the possible undergraduate schools that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for an undergraduate school are - for example, low cost, far away from home, also has a medical school, great pubs, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools. Select your top 20 or so schools to investigate further.\nObtain undergraduate admissions packages from each of your selected schools and review them.\nSign-up and attend local school information sessions, if they\u2019re offered.\nSign-up and attend on-campus school tours and discipline-specific information sessions.If possible, speak to a current or former student and ask their opinion about the school.\nIf possible, speak to a couple of current professors in your programs of interest and ask why you should attend that particular school.\nSpeak to your high school guidance or university counsellor for advice.\nReview university\/college rankings.\nAssess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.\nSelect how many schools you\u2019re going to submit an application for. There is no real limit to how many applications you submit, except money and time. Each application comes with a fee, which is anywhere between $40 and $100. While there is no general consensus on the ideal number, the most common number is between 6 and 14.If in doubt, go with your gut!\n\n, Over 500 colleges accept something called The Common Application, which, when used, can significantly reduce the amount of time required to apply to an undergraduate program. If you are applying to one or more of the Common Application member schools, you can complete the application process on their website and will only need to complete the standard portions of the application once. For any schools who are not Common Application members, you will need to go to their admissions website to complete the application. For the purpose of an example, we\u2019ll use Rutgers University, which does not accept the Common Application.\n\n\nGo to the university\u2019s undergraduate admissions website and find the location of the online application portal. Go to the online portal and register for an account.\nCheck the admissions website for application deadlines for the term you\u2019d like to start - most commonly it would be the fall term, starting in September. The timeline will also include the date by which a decision is made and communicated to you, and the date by which you have to tell the university if you\u2019re going to attend.\nTake note of the required application fee, and how it is to be paid. Most universities will require the fee to be paid before they\u2019ll even look at your application.\nLook for an application checklist which will list all the items you\u2019ll need to submit or do for the application. The checklist will normally include additional items like your self-reported academic record or high school transcripts and SAT\/ACT scores. Make sure you have these items ready, or have already electronically submitted them to the university.\nReview the requirements for an admissions essay, including how it needs to be submitted. Write a first draft of your essay and then have someone (like a parent or guidance counsellor) review it. Revise, edit and complete your essay.\nReview whether your application will require a list of extracurricular activities, which would include employment, community service\/volunteering, athletics, etc.\nReview whether your application will require letters of recommendation. If required, determine how many you need, and who they have to be from (i.e. teachers, parents, employers, etc.). Select whom you\u2019d like to have write you a letter and ask them. Remember to send them a thank you once they\u2019ve submitted the letter! Note that in some cases letters of references must be submitted directly to the university from the referee.\nLog into the admissions application portal and complete the application, then submit it.\n\n, Keep track of the decision dates that were outlined on the university\u2019s admissions website. There may be multiple dates if the university allows for early admissions application. Most universities will provide a decision in the online admissions portal where you submitted your application, or via a specific email address that you registered for. Check the online portal (at least) after the decision deadlines to determine which schools you\u2019ve been accepted to.\n\n\nIn general you\u2019ll get one of three types of responses - accepted, rejected or waitlisted.\nYou are not required to confirm your acceptance before May 1st (for fall admission), so don\u2019t make any final decisions until you\u2019ve received responses from all your applications.Once you\u2019ve received all responses, accept the offer from the highest ranked school you determined in previous steps - unless you\u2019ve changed your mind.\nAcceptances are usually followed by an enrolment or registration deposit to hold your spot at the school. You should only submit an acceptance and enrolment deposit to one school.After you\u2019ve been accepted you\u2019ll normally receive invitations to come (back) to the school for tours and events. Attending them isn\u2019t required, but you\u2019ll certainly view the school differently now that you know you\u2019ll be attending!\n\n, The most important part to remember throughout school is to ensure you\u2019ve completed all the required prerequisite courses for your medical school application.Keep track of your GPA. Consider dropping a course before the appropriate deadline (the deadline by which you can drop a course and it will not appear on your transcript) if you think you\u2019ll end up with a bad grade.\n\n, All medical school applications will want to know about your non-academic activities, including awards, employment, volunteer work, sports, school groups, etc.Follow the AAMC\u2019s Timeline for Application\/Admission to Medical School PDF to make sure you complete as many extracurricular activities as you can that will be helpful for medical school admission.\n\n\nApply for medical or science-related internships during the summer months.\nApply for research assistantship positions (paid or unpaid) during the summer and school terms.\n\n, All medical schools will require at least 2-3 letters of recommendation from someone who knows your abilities and skills. Letters from university professors, doctors, deans and associate deans, etc., are normally required.Volunteering in a professor\u2019s lab, or working in a medical research centre, will make sure the professor knows you well enough to write a letter.\n\n, The MCAT, or Medical College Admissions Test, is a standard test required by all medical schools. It is administered via the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The AAMC recommends taking the MCAT once you have completed any coursework that is relevant to the subjects on the test.However, each medical school will have its own requirements as to how old the score can be when you apply - the norm is 2-3 years old maximum.\n\n\nThe AAMC provides a timeline that can help you plan when to register for the MCAT, when to take it and when to apply to medical school.\nThe AAMC implemented a new MCAT in 2015, which replaces their previous version from 1991. If you took the MCAT before 2015, it is very important that you check the Medical school policies for accepting scores from the current and the new MCAT exams PDF. Some medical schools will only accept the 2015 version of the MCAT as of certain admissions cycles.\nWhile not required, it is strongly recommended that you take some sort of prep course for writing the MCAT. The way the test is laid out, and the way in which it is timed, are very important and knowing this in advance is extremely helpful. Most prep courses also hold one or more fake exams to give you an idea of what it\u2019ll be like in the real thing.\nYou can take the MCAT more than once, if you feel you didn\u2019t do well the first time.However, be aware that some medical schools will actually combine the averages of the scores if the test was taken more than once (and you cannot prevent this)., There are over 170 accredited medical schools in the United States.Several medical school rankings exist that help determine which schools are better than others, based on a variety of factors.There are also a number of tools found online that can help you evaluate which medical school(s) are right for you.In the end, however, selecting a medical school will be similar to when you selected an undergraduate school. You may have restrictions, such as financial, geographical, etc., that may limit which schools you can apply to.\n\n\nMake a list of all the possible medical schools - in your career journal - that meet your criteria. Write down what your priorities for a medical school are - for example, cost, reputation, class sizes, research programs, faculty, etc. - and then rank them. Score each school against your priorities, then rank the schools.\nRead all the information about each medical school on their websites.\nAttend any seminars, webinars or information sessions held by the medical school. Ask questions.\nBook a campus tour at each medical school, if possible.\nSeek the advice of your professors, school career advisors and alumni.\nReview the medical school rankings.\nAssess each school (using your career journal) and make a final ranking.\nDetermine how many applications you\u2019re going to submit. In 2014, over 170 medical schools in the U.S. received 731,595 applications, yet they only graduated 20,343 students in the same year.That\u2019s less than a 3% admissions rate! As with undergraduate programs, there is no limit to the number of medical schools you can apply, but the fees associated with these applications are much higher ($160 for the first one plus $36 for each additional one).If you can afford it, you should try to apply to all the medical schools that interest you.\nIf in doubt, go with your gut!\n\n, Contact the people who you\u2019d like to write your letters of recommendation and request the letters. Since you might ask one referee to send a letter to more than one school, it will probably be helpful to create a list of the medical schools and the mailing addresses for the letters and send this list to each referee. They\u2019ll probably use the same basic letter for each school, but preparing them will take time.Letters of recommendation have to mailed directly from the referee to the medical school, so don\u2019t have your referees send the letters back to you.\n\n, All medical school applications can be submitted via the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) and\/or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). These services allow you to submit one full application and send it to as many medical schools as you want.The first application will cost $160 and each additional medical school will cost $36.,,\nLog into the website, when ready, and enter all the information requested while following the instruction manual.Submit the application online, when completed, and pay all the associated application fees.Check your AMCAS and\/or AACOMAS account(s) regularly to check the status of each application and submit any additional information that is requested., Some, but not all, medical schools will require an interview as part of the admissions process. Some interviews may be conducted on the phone or via the internet, but many are done in person.Book your travel to\/from each medical school.\nFor each medical school for which an interview is requested, print out and complete the Mission & Interview Question Worksheet from the AAMC website.\nFor each medical school for which an interview is requested, review their website and read any information they have posted regarding the interview.\nReview your career journal and determine if you have any outstanding questions you wanted to ask during the interview.\n\n, Review the admissions websites for each medical to which you have applied and check the timeline for when you can expect an admission offer and the deadline for when you have to accept the offer.If you\u2019ve been accepted to more than one medical school, check how you ranked the schools and accept the school that you ranked highest - unless you\u2019ve changed your mind.\n\n, In general medical school will take 4 years to complete, and those 4 years are very structured.Your first year, and possibly some or all of your second year, will include mainly coursework. Your second and\/or third years will include actual clinical experience where you\u2019ll rotate among most of the major medical disciplines. Your third and\/or your last year will be spent on a project that will include additional clinical experience, but this time in a specific discipline of your interest.\n\n\nYour scholarly project is where you can focus on oncology as a specialty, and be assigned to one or more oncologists as an advisor or mentor., There are three main types of oncologists - medical, radiation and surgical. In addition, there are also oncologists who specialize in gynecology, pediatrics and hematology.Based on your experiences in medical school, select which type of oncology you\u2019d like to focus on - this will help narrow down residency options.\n\n, By this point in your medical education, you\u2019ll have met a lot of medical doctors, specialists, and professors, not to mention fellow students. All of these are sources for ideas on where to do a residency. Do some additional research online and determine what your priorities are for a residency - then compare those priorities to the programs offered. Select more than one program to which to apply.\n\n\nThere are many things to consider regarding a residency, including: the stability of the program (does it have a future?), what type of support you get in the program, how flexible is the program schedule, what is the reputation of the institution, does it provide you with the possibility of advancement after it done, location, and more., Review all the prerequisites and requirements of the application and ensure you have them all in order. Write a draft of your personal statement, walk away for at least 24 hours and come back and revise it. Ask someone (professor, doctor, fellow student) to review your statement for you and provide feedback. Update and finalize your CV. Submit your applications via the method indicated for each program.Many residency programs use the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) which helps potential residents and residency programs find each other.Many residency programs also use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) as a centralized method to receive applications and documentation from applicants., Just like medical school, every residency program will want to interview you before offering your admission to their program. At this level it is likely you\u2019ll need to attend the interview in person, but some programs may help pay the cost of travel., Your residency offers (or matches in this case) will come through the ERAS system where you submitted your application. All residency matches are released on Match Day which is the third Friday of March each year.Due to how the system works, you should receive only one offer - based on how your ranked each programs, and how each program ranked you. You are required to accept that offer, which means you have to be very care how many programs you select, and how you rank them., The experiences you gain in your residency program are vital to your career as an oncologist. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you have any. Use your residency to enlarge your professional network and learn about potential fellowships and full-time jobs.\n\n, The USMLE is a three-step examination that tests potential doctor\u2019s on their skills in medicine and patient care. Medical licenses are granted by each state, not nationally, but each state requires the USMLE as a requirement to licensing.Use the Licensing Examination Services portal of the National Board of Medical Examiners to register for Steps 1 or 2 of the examination.\nStep 1 and Step 2 CK exams cost $590 each, Step 2 CK costs $1250, Step 3 costs $815..Step 1 is normally taken after your second year of medical school, while Step 2 is normally taken after your fourth year of medical school. Step 3 is taken while you\u2019re completing your residency.The process to apply for Step 3 of the examination differs between states, but you can use the Federation of State Medical Boards online portal to register and pay for the Step 3 exam.\n\n, Each state has its own medical board which controls licensing of doctors, therefore each state has slightly different requirements for obtaining a license. Find the medical board\u2019s website for the state where you will be practicing and review the licensing procedure.We will use the state of Colorado as our example for obtaining your medical license.\nThe state of Colorado requires that you have malpractice insurance in the state \u2018\u2019\u2019before\u2019\u2019\u2019 you apply for your license.Obtain malpractice insurance if you do not already have it, or determine if you meet one of the exception requirements.\nThe state of Colorado requires that each applicant meet the following qualifications: proof of graduation from medical school, passage of USMLE or other national exam, completion of postgraduate education (i.e. residency) and reference letters from places where you have previously practiced.Twenty-three states use the Federation of State Medical Boards\u2019 Uniform Application for potential licensees.The Uniform Application is essentially a centralized, online application portal for submitting license requirements. The nice thing about the Uniform Application is that once you\u2019ve completed one application it can be sent to any of the states that participate in the program., Medical oncologists must complete a three-year residency in internal medicine and then complete a two-year fellowship in medical oncology. Surgical oncologists must complete a five-year residency in general surgery and then complete a two-year fellowship in surgical oncology. Radiation oncologists complete a five-year radiation oncology program (residency) but do not need to complete a fellowship., Board certification is not a requirement to practice medicine or oncology. However, board certification will most likely increase your reputation and job potential.\n\n\nMedical oncology is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).\nRadiation oncology is certified by either the The American Board of Radiology or The American Board of Physician Specialties.\nSurgical oncology is certified by the The American Board of Medical Specialties.\n\n, During your residency and\/or fellowship you would have developed an extensive professional network. Use your network to determine if there are any oncologist positions available in your favoured locations. Search for oncology positions on your own using any and all resources available to you.\n\n\nThe Journal of Clinical Oncology, as an example, has an online Oncology Career Centre with oncology-related positions available in the United States, and around the world. Each posting will provide you with instructions on how to apply to that specific position.\nThe Society of Surgical Oncology, as another example, has a career website that specialized in surgical oncologist positions available in the United States. Each posting will provide instructions on how to apply to that specific position.\nRemember that if you apply to and accept a position in a state other than where you're licensed, you will need to obtain a license to practice medicine in that state before you can begin practicing.\nTake advantage of the career centers and advisors available at your medical school to help you find oncology positions. Use their help to update your CV, craft cover letters and personal statements, and practice for interviews.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":639}
{"text":" In order to build a basic robot, you'll need several simple components. You can find most, if not all, of these components at your local electronics hobby shop, or at a number of online retailers. Some basic kits may include all of these components as well. This robot does not require any soldering:\n\n\nArduino Uno (or other microcontroller)\n2 continuous rotation servos\n2 wheels that fit the servos\n1 caster roller\n1 small solderless breadboard (look for a breadboard that has two positive and negative lines on each side)\n1 distance sensor (with four-pin connector cable)\n1 mini push button switch\n1 10k\u03a9 resistor\n1 USB A to B cable\n1 set of breakaway headers\n1 6 x AA battery holder with 9V DC power jack\n1 pack of jumper wires or 22-gauge hook-up wire\nStrong double-sided tape or hot glue;\n, You'll be building the robot's body using the battery pack as a base.\n\n, This should be the end that the battery pack's wire is coming out of The servos should be touching bottoms, and the rotating mechanisms of each should be facing out the sides of the battery pack. It's important that the servos are properly aligned so that the wheels go straight. The wires for the servos should be coming off the back of the battery pack.\n\n, Make sure that they are solidly attached to the battery pack. The backs of the servos should be aligned flush with the back of the battery pack.\n\n\nThe servos should now be taking up the back half of the battery pack.\n\n, It should hang over the front of the battery pack just a little bit, and will extend beyond each side. Make sure that it is securely fastened before proceeding. The \"A\" row should be closest to the servos.\n\n, If you attached the servos properly, there should be a flat space made by them touching. Stick the Arduino board onto this flat space so that the Arduino's USB and Power connectors are facing the back (away from the breadboard). The front of the Arduino should be just barely overlapping the breadboard.\n\n, Firmly press the wheels onto the rotating mechanism of the servo. This may require a significant amount of force, as the wheels are designed to fit as tightly as possible for the best traction.\n\n, If you flip the chassis over, you should see a bit of breadboard extending past the battery pack. Attach the caster to this extended piece, using risers if necessary. The caster acts as the front wheel, allowing the robot to easily turn in any direction.If you bought a kit, the caster may have come with a few risers that you can use to ensure the caster reaches the ground.\n\n, You'll be using these to connect the servos to the breadboard. Push the pins down through the header so that the pins come out in an equal distance on both sides.\n\n, Make sure that they are firmly inserted.\n\n, This will connect the servos to the breadboard. Make sure the left servo is connected to the left header, and the right servo to the right header.\n\n, Make sure you use the red rail on the back of the breadboard (closer to the rest of the chassis).\n\n, Make sure that you use the blue rail on the back of the breadboard. Do not plug them into the red rail pins.\n\n, This will allow the Arduino to control the servos and turn the wheels.\n\n, It does not get plugged into the outer power rails on the breadboard, but instead into the first row of lettered pins (J). Make sure you place it in the exact center, with an equal number of pins available on each side.\n\n, This will ground the sensor.\n\n, This will power the sensor.\n\n, This will feed information from the sensor to the microcontroller.\n\n, Orient it so that the battery pack cable is coming out to the left at the bottom.\n\n, Make absolutely sure that the battery pack is oriented correctly.\n\n, These two cables will help provide the correct voltage to the Arduino.\n\n, The black cable should be plugged into the blue rail pin at pin 30. The red cable should be plugged into the red rail pin at pin 30.\n\n, Connect it at pin 28 on the blue rail.\n\n, Do not connect the red rails, as you will likely damage the Arduino.\n\n, This will provide the power to the Arduino.\n\n, This switch will allow you to turn off the robot without having to unplug the power.\n\n, This will power the button.\n\n, Connect it to the pin directly next to the black wire that you connected a few steps ago.\n\n, This will allow the Arduino to register the push button.\n\n, This is the Arduino development environment, and allows you to program instructions that you can then upload to your Arduino microcontroller.

{"text":" It typically begins with sudden, severe pain \u2014 often in one joint, and most commonly in your big toe (on one side or the other). It often begins at night, and may wake you from sleep. The affected joint often appears red and swollen and may feel warm to the touch, and you will likely have a decreased range of motion around the affected joint.\n\n\nIf your joint pain is of gradual onset and does not match the profile above, it is less likely to be gout.\nIt may be something else, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, among other things.;\n, An infection may also occur concurrently alongside a gout attack, and the two are almost impossible to tell apart without diagnostic tests.\n\n\nAn infected joint will likely also be sudden in onset, appear red and swollen and warm to the touch, and may be accompanied by a fever.\nYou will need analysis of your joint fluid to distinguish between gout and an infection.\n\n,\"Pseudogout, also known as calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD), also presents very similarly to gout (hence its name). Again, the only way to truly differentiate pseudogout from gout is to have your joint fluid looked at under a microscope.\n\n, If you do have gout, you will experience \"attacks\" of it followed by remissions (or followed by total resolution). Gout does not tend to be a persistent, chronic, and consistent condition. Rather, it either comes as a one-time attack, or a series of flare-ups and exacerbations, followed by periods of remission (or improvement).\n\n\nIf the pain in your joint persists for weeks or even months, without much variability, it is likely to be another diagnosis such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.\n\n,\n\n\nIf your family members have had gout before, you are also at a heightened risk of developing gout. This, again, would increase the probability that your current joint problem is gout-related.\nAdditional risk factors for gout include: being male, being a post-menopausal female, having other health conditions (namely high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems), consuming excess alcohol, being overweight, and taking certain medications (such as aspirin, diuretics, and certain immunosuppressive agents).\n\n, Chronic gout consists of recurrent gout attacks over a prolonged period of time. It often leads to the formation of \"tophi\" (hard bumps under the skin in the joint area), which is a characteristic sign of chronic gout.\n\n\nThe presence of tophi \u2014 that can be visually seen in a joint \u2014 is one of the cardinal signs of chronic gout (also known as \"tophaceous gout\").\nThis is one of the best ways to distinguish gout from other chronic arthritic conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, because no other chronic forms of arthritis present with tophi.\n\n, The medical conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis will depend significantly on whether you have only one joint affected, or multiple joints affected. The differences are as follows:\n\n\nIf you have only one joint affected, it is more likely to be gout, pseudogout, or an infected joint.\nIf you have multiple joints affected, it may still be gout or pseudogout. It may also be another condition, though, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.\nLastly, if you have multiple joints affected, the probability of an infection is slim to none (as an infection normally affects only one joint at a time).\n\n, Elevated uric acid levels heighten the likelihood that it is gout. Creatinine is a measure of kidney function. Poor kidney function may lead to inadequate uric acid clearance from your body, and the resulting build-up of uric acid may predispose you to gout.\n\n\nNote, however, that there is no direct correlation between uric acid levels on your blood test and a diagnosis of gout.\nMany people have elevated uric acid levels, but do not ever experience clinical signs or symptoms of gout.\nSimilarly, many people who do have clinical signs and symptoms of gout do not who elevated levels of uric acid.\nThere is a correlation, for sure, and your likelihood of gout is increased with elevated uric acid levels, but it is not required (nor is it the exclusive criteria) in the diagnosis of gout.\n\n, She will then examine this fluid under the microscope.\n\n\nIf it is gout, the microscope will show the presence of uric acid crystals.\nIt is is pseudogout, the microscope will show the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals.\nIf it is septic arthritis, the microscope will show neither uric acid crystals nor calcium pyrophosphate crystals.\n\n,\n\nAlthough looking at synovial joint fluid under a microscope can be diagnostic of gout (if the presence of uric acid crystals is detected), it is key to understand that gout and an infection are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Therefore, even if the test comes back diagnostic for gout, an infection could still potentially be present.\n\nHaving the synovial fluid sent for a culture will examine to see if any bacteria or other microbes grow.\nIf there is an infection, the culture dish will grow the microbe, which will be diagnostic for \"septic arthritis\" (a diagnosis that may exist alongside gout).\n\n,\n\nAn x-ray can help to distinguish between gout and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, which has a distinct appearance on x-ray. An x-ray is usually sufficient for imaging; however, in some cases, an ultrasound or a CT scan may also be of help in assessing your underlying joint problem, particularly if it does not appear to be caused by gout., Examples include Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxen (Aleve). These can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.\n\n\nStronger NSAIDs may be prescribed to you by your doctor if the over-the-counter versions are insufficient to help relieve your gout.\n\n,\n\n\nAs a result, colchicine is most frequently used after an acute gout attack subsides, with the goal of preventing future gout attacks.\nTaken in low doses for preventative purposes, the side effects of colchicine are rarely problematic.\n\n, Corticosteroids can be prescribed in pill form, or they can be injected directly into the affected joint (which is usually the better option, as you avoid the side effects that can come from taking them in pill form).\n\n\nAn example of a corticosteroid is Prednisone.\nCorticosteroids are generally given in limited amounts, such as one (or minimal) injections into your affected joint, and\/or a limited course of corticosteroids taken in pill form.\n\n, The purpose of these medications is to decrease your likelihood of future gout attacks.\n\n\nAllopurinol is an example of a medication that can help to prevent excess uric acid production.\nProbenecid is an example of a medication that can aid in your kidney's ability to filter and remove uric acid from your body.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":649}

It is usually (but not always) the same as the general community preference.\nThe Deaf, Blind, and Autistic communities prefer identity-first language, such as \"Deaf person\" over \"person with deafness\"The Bleeding and Blood Disorder community,and the Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) community (excluding autism),prefers person-first language, such as \"person with Hemophilia\" instead of \"Hemophiliac.\"\nFor a community with no clear preference, try using a mix throughout your piece (e.g. both \"disabled people\" and \"people with disabilities\").\n\n, Say \"people with epilepsy\" instead of \"epileptics,\" \"blind people\" instead of \"the blind,\" and \"people with disabilities\" or \"disabled people\" instead of \"the disabled.\" Remember that people have disabilities. They are not the disability.\n\n\nSome people in the Autistic community are fine with being referred to as \"Autistics,\" just as one might refer to \"artists\" or \"blondes.\" This is an exception to the rule.Since autism is a spectrum disorder, to say that a person with autism is \"on the spectrum\" is also acceptable.\n\n, \"Tyrell is Blind\") or to refer to a community (e.g., \"Rainbows are a common motif in Autistic culture\").\n\n\nDisabilities that involve the last name of the person who discover them are usually capitalized (e.g. Down Syndrome).\n\n, Some language has been turned into an insult or is used in dehumanizing ways. These words have adopted derogatory connotations and are best not to use.Instead, name the disability (e.g. \"uses a wheelchair\" or \"has Tourette syndrome\").\n\n\nMidget\/dwarf(some are okay with \"dwarf,\" but generally \"little person\" is best)Invalid, lame\nCripple(d)Defect, deformity, affliction\nMongoloid\nCrazy, insane, maniac\nSpaz\nHandicappedRetard(ed)\nIdiot, moron, dumb, or any term that is considered an insult in popular culture\n\n, A non-verbal woman who waves her arms about may be a self-sufficient, talented writer. An articulate man who \"passes\" for non-disabled may have serious trouble caring for himself and holding down a job.. Avoid judging people on how they look or labeling them as either full of unrestricted potential or severely disabled for life. All people with disabilities have both strengths and needs, and neither aspect should be overlooked.\n\n\nDon't assume that someone has an intellectual disability based on facial expression, motor skills, disability accent, or other disability symptoms.\nPeople with disabilities, notably in Autistic culture, have rejected restrictive labels like \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning.\"Describe individual needs. For example, instead of \"Hikaru is low-functioning,\" say \"Hikaru is nonverbal and gets assistance with cooking, cleaning, and self care.\"\n\n, Most people with disabilities are ordinary people; they get up every morning, eat cereal, travel to school or work, and pass through an ordinary day. Their disabilities do not make their life unlivable. Stick to factual language, such as \"Ahmed has an anxiety disorder.\" Avoid terms such as...\n\n\n\"Suffers from\"\"Struggles with\/is fighting\"(unless the person says so themselves)\n\"Confined\/Bound to a wheelchair\" (is also inaccurate; some wheelchair users can stand or walk short distances)\n\"Victim of\"\"Will never\"\n\"Stricken by\"\n\"Patient\" (unless they actually are receiving treatment in a medical facility)\n\n, If you refer to non-disabled people by last name, then refer to a disabled person by last name.If you refer to everyone by first name, then do the same for people with disabilities. This shows that you respect them as much as you do other people.\n\n\nFor example, if you refer to Angela Ramirez as \"Ramirez\" and Ryan Black as \"Black,\" then you would refer to Jimmy McCoy as \"McCoy,\" not \"Jimmy\" or \"Jim.\"\nIf you refer to Angela Ramirez as \"Angela\" and Ryan Black as \"Ryan,\" then \"Jimmy\" or \"Jim\" would be appropriate.\n\n, It is acceptable by most communities to use both, but \"Accessible\" is preferred.New York in particular has replaced its universal handicap symbol with a redesigned \"mobile\" accessibility image., \"Non-disabled people\" or \"people without disabilities\" is an easy way to describe people who don't have disabilities. Avoid referring to such people as \"normal,\" as this suggests that disabled people are abnormal.\n\n, A common quip in the disability community is \"Nothing about us without us is for us,\" and non-disabled people should not be the sole authorities on disabled people. Ask real people with disabilities for their thoughts and opinions, and whenever possible, ask a person how they prefer to be addressed.\n\n\nA good organization has many people with disabilities at all levels of membership, and elevates instead of suppresses their voices.\n\n, A distorted form of pity, inspiration porn glorifies a disabled person for being able to do everyday things (e.g., \"It's so incredible that she can walk around on the prosthetic legs she's been using for 15 years\"). The purpose is to inspire people without disabilities, or to belittle their \"excuses\" for not doing something a disabled person can achieve.\n\n\n\nLiving with a disability isn't automatically courageous, special, or superhuman.\nThis implies that it is unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills, or that their abilities are inherently lesser (the assumption being that if a disabled person can do it, anyone can).\n\n, Disabilities are often lifelong, and a disabled person will experience challenges throughout their lives. Individual problems can be overcome, but disability is usually for life.\n\n\nPeople cannot \"recover\" from lifelong disabilities; however, they can adapt and gain new skills. It is possible to be successful and disabled at the same time.\n\n, Just like non-disabled people, disabled people have good days and bad days. Someone who uses a wheelchair one day might use a cane the next, and crutches after that. This does not mean they are faking it or \"getting better,\" just that this particular day happens to be easier.\n\n\nExhaustion, seizures, stress, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves yesterday, recent flare-ups (e.g. a person with a blood disorder having a minor bleed), and many other things can play a role in how their disability manifests itself.\nPeople may or may not look different when they are having a hard day. Don't assume that they're feeling okay because they look fine, or that their disability equipment (e.g. crutches) is just for show.\nThe spoon theory describes how many people with disabilities, from chronic pain to depression, need to budget their energy., People with disabilities can be good friends, sons, daughters, lovers, siblings, and spouses. Many are capable of working. All are worthwhile human beings.\n\n\nBefriending or falling in love with a disabled person isn't an act of charity. The person with a disability has something to contribute to the relationship.\nIf a disabled child is murdered, treat it the same way you'd treat the murder of a non-disabled child. Don't focus on how \"difficult\" it was to live with the victim, or portray it as a mercy killing or understandable crime., One of the biggest ways to combat ableism is to use empathy. When you write about a given disability, imagine a person with that disability reading your piece. How would they feel about themselves? Would they feel respected or demeaned? Write in a way that shows disabled people that they are respected, they are valued, and they are not alone.\n\n\nWhen in doubt, look it up! There are plenty of writers with disabilities online who share their experiences.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":651}
{"text":" It is easy for autistic people to become stressed or overwhelmed, so creating quiet places can help them stay calm.\n\n\nWhen they are looking for a place to sit, suggest one with minimal distractions (e.g. facing away from a noisy kitchen)\nMove conversations to quiet places\n\nDesignate an area where the autistic person can retreat during stress, and fill it with calming things;\n, Autistic people may have a hard time with unexpected changes in day-to-day life. Routines can support their sense of stability. When changes are made to those routines, the whole day can be completely thrown off, leading to confusion, fear, anger, or a meltdown. Here are some tips to keep things stable:Help them create a schedule. Time slots can be used to designate what activities will happen during each part of the day.\nMaintain a visual calendar. Place it in a prominent and accessible location, such as a wall in the family room.\nIllustrations (clip art or drawings) can make the calendar look more friendly and appealing\n\n, To prepare your loved one for this change, you should try to plan the event with them so they know it is comingFor example, a dentist's appointment may change your loved one's schedule. Put this event on your loved one\u2019s calendar and discuss it with them ahead of time. While they might not be happy about her schedule being changed, they will at least be prepared.\nTry to place activities at specific time slots. For example, if they have math meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00, plan something else at 3:00 (e.g. a family hike) so that they will always have some sort of activity at the time.\n\n, After a busy day at school, a social event, an appointment, or an outing, an autistic person is likely to feel tired. Time spent doing quiet activities (reading, playing, special interests) will help them recharge and stay balanced.\n\n\nRemember that your idea of relaxation may not match their idea of relaxation.\nDuring a schedule change, try to schedule something positive after the stressful change. For example, after a doctor appointment, let your son have free time until supper.\n\n, Autistic people often struggle with Sensory Processing Disorder, a neurological disorder in which sensory input that feels normal to other people may feel distracting, intensely uncomfortable, or even painful to the individual. Understand that these sensitivities cannot be ignored or willed away, and cause real distress.\n\n\nCommunicate with your loved one about the stimuli. Notice what causes discomfort, or ask. They may potentially be able to express discomfort, or give you clues. Pinpoint what the issues are, and try to find ways around them.\nFor example, if your teenage sister cannot handle the sharp taste of toothpaste, try helping her pick out a milder flavor (e.g. children's bubble gum) toothpaste at the store.\n\n, Some autism therapies, particularly behavior modification like ABA, can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder if they are done wrong.Some therapies are designed to break the patient's will, or force them to act \"normal.\"This can be very emotionally damaging.\n\n\nAvoid experimental or compliance-based therapy.\nThe autistic person should be able to say \"no\" and take breaks.\nTherapy should not involve crying, screaming, violence, or pleading for help.\nIf you suspect that a therapy is overwhelming, frightening, or painful, stop it.If you are not an adult, tell an adult, or report it to the authorities.\n\n, Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy (if they constantly need to stim), can introduce them to sensory stimuli in a safe and controllable way, and can improve their mood and sense of security. Find an activity they like, and stick with it.\n\n\nAutistic people may do better in individual sports, or in non-competitive environments. Even taking regular walks can be good for your loved one.\n\n, Special interests can offer a refuge to autistic people, develop important skills (for example, a young writer will learn to take critique), and possibly lead to a satisfying hobby or career. It also encourages the autistic person to be themselves.\n\n\n\nChoose toys related to the interest\nDiscuss their interest for a comfortable time period, e.g. during a car ride (You can also model reciprocal conversation by asking questions)\nHelp them learn more via library books\nSuggest that they join clubs and activities related to the interest, since socializing may be less threatening if they like the conversation topic\n\n, Knowing your loved one's triggers can help you identify a potentially overwhelming situation, and defuse it before stress reaches the boiling point. Consider keeping a record of meltdown triggers to help future prevention.\n\n\nFor example, going to a restaurant can be very chaotic for a child. Sometimes removing her from the environment for a few minutes is enough to help them stay relaxed.\n\n, Meltdowns are the result of stress buildup in autistic people, and the best treatment is prevention. Here are ways to notice when a meltdown may be coming:Frustration\nHaving too many verbal instructions given to them at one time.\nWitnessing injustice\nPainful\/overwhelming stimuli\nChanges in routine\nNot being able to understand or communicate effectively\n\n, Your loved one may not realize how badly stress is building up, or may be unable to communicate it. Remove any stressors, and ask what is bothering them.\n\n\nTake them outside for a break.\nGet them away from crowds or other stressors.\nAvoid placing demands on them. If other people are doing so, ask them to give the autistic person a break.\n\n, Autistic people are used to being told that their needs are over-the-top or burdensome, so if they ask for something to change, it's probably causing them real pain or distress.\n\n\nDon't hold their needs hostage. Even if they don't use their words or say please properly, assume that it is urgent. You can coach them on proper delivery when they aren't on the verge of tears.\n\n, Try bringing them outdoors, or leading them to their calming down corner. This will give them a chance to relax where they aren't surrounded by people and stimuli.\n\n, Never shout at or blame them for a meltdown. They often feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed about losing control, and making them feel worse will only make it more difficult to calm down.Avoid crowds or staring people. Ask them to stop it, or get the autistic person somewhere less public.\n\n, Stimming (aka self-stimulatory behavior) is a way to stimulate the senses, and it can be extremely calming for autistic people. Examples include rocking, hand flapping, jumping, and fidgeting. Here are some ways to encourage the autistic person to stim:\n\n\nOffer a rocking chair (if available)\nBring their favorite stim toys and\/or a weighted blanket.\nAsk about a stim that they like to use for self-calming (e.g. \"Do you want to flap your arms?\")\nOffer a bear hug\nDo not judge them for looking unusual, and if anyone else objects to the autistic person's self-calming efforts, use your words or a sharp stare to let them know that this is unacceptable\n\n, Encourage an honest, constructive conversation. Focus on the triggers, and what they (and you!) could do to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\n\nIf a crowded store sends your daughter into tears, try planning the trip when the store will be less crowded, bringing earplugs and stim toys, or letting her stay at home.\nIf news of a violent attack triggered a meltdown in your brother, suggest to your parents that they not leave the news on at night, and help him with relaxation exercises.\n\n, Autistic body language can be different from non-autistic body language, and autistic people may not always realize what an expression or gesture means.Don't expect eye contact. Autistic people often pay attention better when they don't have to look at people's eyes.\nExpect fidgeting and unusual movements.\nLearn your loved one's baseline, and what their unique body language means.\n\n, Due to this confusion about body language, an autistic person will more than likely not produce body language that matches the way she is feeling. This is also the case with tone. Because of this, it is important to remind yourself not to read into or be offended by any rude tone or body language that is directed at you.For example, your loved one\u2019s tone may seem short and rude, yet they may be in a fantastic mood.\n\nWatching their stims may offer cues. For example, if a boy only flaps his hands when he is happy, then this is probably a reliable sign that nothing is actually wrong.\nEven if they are upset, it may not be your fault. For example, a barking dog may have been putting them on edge all day.\n\n, This means that while the autistic person is fully capable of understanding language, it may be hard for their brain to translate spoken words to their meanings as quickly as you can. Gauge their reaction to verbal instructions or long lists.They may need written instructions, or she may just require more processing time before responding.\n\n\nThey may be unable to remember spoken lists, and need written and\/or illustrated lists as well.\nGive them time to think and process. They may be slower to respond.\nThey may be better at reading and writing than at handling spoken conversation.\n\n, Your loved one may have a hard time communicating in busy places where there is a lot of noise. In places where multiple people are talking, your loved one may become stressed and overwhelmed. Instead, communicate with them in calm environments where little is going on.\n\n\nIf a room is crowded, move elsewhere.\nTry using AAC if you cannot move (e.g. sign language, picture charts, or typing).\n\n, Focus training is a training course the can help your loved one to develop strategies for interactions with other people. This type of training teaches individuals how to understand thoughts and feelings. Focus training is generally done in a group setting, though it can also be done in an individual session. During the therapy, your loved one will hopefully develop strategies for emotional regulation, conversational skills, problem solving, and friendship skills.Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a popular form.\nNot all social skills groups teach useful skills. For example, if your gay teen's social skills group focuses on heteronormativity, this is not helpful.\n\n, According to the \"Intense World\" theory of autism, the world can quickly become frightening or overwhelming to autistic people, and they may need extra support in learning to handle it.These exercises may include:\n\n\nPracticing deep breathing\nCounting to feel calm\nHolding a favorite toy or item until she feels better\nCertain stims\nYoga, meditation, or stretching\nTaking a break with music or singing\n\n, Phrases such as \"I need a break, please\" or \"May I go to my corner?\" can be particularly useful. Avoiding meltdowns becomes easier once your loved one can identify their own triggers and ask for help in taking action.\n\n\nReinforce this behavior by immediately honoring the request.\nIf they are just learning how to do this, thank them for speaking up. \"Thank you for letting me know that the loud noise hurt your ears! Now I can help you find earplugs, and you can wait outside with your brother while I check out.\"\n\n, Fictional examples can help autistic people understand how others feel, and why they feel that way. It allows autistic people to analyze emotion from a safer distance.\n\n\nIf the child does not understand basic expressions, try teaching them with flash cards.Ask \"How do you think this character is feeling right now?\" during books or movies. Offer suggestions if the person isn't sure.\nAlso try social skills: \"Do you think it was a good idea for her to do that? No? What would be a good idea?\"\nLook for shows that are a mix of fun and education, such as My Little Pony.\n\n\n, Recognize that your loved one is never going to be the life of the party, and that is all right. Focus on what they want to do: perhaps they want to make two close friends, or have someone to play with at recess. Tailor social skills to their desires, not just your own.\n\n, Autistic children may be incredibly passionate about their interests, and thus may not always notice when they are monopolizing the conversation, or realize that their partner wants to change the subject. Teach your child how to:\n\n\nAsk questions to engage others (\"How was work today, Mommy?\")\nTell whether someone is busy\nGauge whether someone is interested\nLet the conversation shift organically\nListen\nKnow when monologuing is a good idea (e.g. when someone wants to learn about their subject of interest)\n\n, Remember, the autistic person is constantly learning and growing, and you are one of their role models. Behave in the way that you want them to behave, and they will take after you.\n\n\n\nGenuinely listen to the autistic person, and ask questions.\nWhen frustrated or exhausted, act the way you would like the autistic person to act. Take a break if need be. (It's okay!)\n\nDemonstrate compassion. Never do something to an autistic person that you wouldn't do to a non-autistic person.\nTreat their feelings as meaningful and valid.\n\n, Autistic people are at higher risk for anxiety and depression, which may mean lower self-esteem. Bolster their self-esteem by recognizing their good qualities, and praising their efforts to grow. Make it clear that you are proud of them.\n\n\nPraise can come in the form of kind words, hugs, time spent together, or extra free time.\nWhile praise is good, do not treat praise as an ultimate goal. If a person becomes dependent on praise, they may become a people-pleaser, and be unable to set boundaries.\n\n, Autistic people need to learn how to stand up for themselves, assert their needs, and say \"no\" when they don't want something. This is especially important, since they are at a higher risk for being abused.Allow them to refuse things. (\"I don't want that sweater. It hurts!\")\nPraise them for expressing their needs. (\"Thank you for letting me know the music is too loud. I'll turn it down right away.\")\nGive them choices and encourage thinking.\nAvoid compliance therapies, which can hinder their ability to say no.\nWhen your loved one says \"no,\" listen. What's wrong? If something is unavoidable, can you remove the part that makes it distasteful, or strike a bargain that they are happy with? Only ignore a \"no\" in important cases of health or safety.\nTeens and adults may gain skills through self-advocacy groups such as ASAN or the Autism Women's Network. (However, be careful about introducing them to such groups if they are sensitive, since the issues of hatred,abusive therapy,and torturemay disrupt their sleep.)\n\n, Autism has a wide range of aspects that vary from person to person. Since autism is a developmental disability, communication and social skills tend to be a challenge. Specific symptoms vary.Autism is not a linear spectrum from \"mild\" to \"severe.\" It impacts many different areas in different ways. For example, maybe your friend is funny and great at cheering people up, and has serious difficulty with self-care and sensory processing. An autistic person can be strong in one area and weak in another.\n\n, It is important to understand your loved one's symptoms. Once you understand where the challenges lie, you can target those areas. Find out what strengths your loved one has, and what challenges they face. All of these components are important when choosing treatment options and coping mechanisms.\n\n, It is good to know the general signs, and what autistic people think about autism. (Autistic-run organizations and blogs are usually good sources.) Here are a few signs of autism:Motor skills may be delayed\nDifficulty understanding and interacting with others\nDifficulty grasping abstract uses of language (e.g. sarcasm, metaphors)\nSpecial interests that are unusual in terms of focus and passion\nOver- or under-sensitivity to various stimuli (sounds, sights, smells, etc.)\nDifficulty with self care\nRepetitive behavior, notably stimming\n\n\n, One autistic person might want to focus on developing the self-care skills to live on her own, while another might want to make friends. Others might be perfectly fine with living in assisted living, or not making more friends. Recognize that your idea of the ideal lifestyle might differ from their idea, and it's most important that they are able to be happy.\n\n, Autistic people are not embarrassing, broken, or deficient\u2014simply different. Instead of saying \"I'll finally be happy when my loved one _____,\" practice being happy now, and embarking on your journey together. Demonstrate unconditional love, so they can love themselves.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":652}

{"text":" Push any rubbish or undesirable material toward the pile, and move other material, brush, and obstacles away from the pile to be dealt with later.;\n, \u00a0You have three common choices for fence material, along with several more exotic ones, depending on your budget and needs. Here are examples:\n\n\nChain link fencing. This is a durable material that will prevent rubbish from scattering, and is effective at keep larger animals like dogs, bears, coyotes, and others out of the pile. There are also vinyl strips that can be woven into the fabric to limit the view.\nWood privacy type fencing. This is not quite as durable as chain link, and generally is more expensive and requires more labor, but it does create an attractive fence and will keep most animals out of the rubbish.\nWelded wire fabric fencing. This material is made with wires, welded together in a grid, for example, 2inch by 4inch, then galvanized. It is inexpensive but not very durable, and is less effective at keeping animals out, especially smaller rodents.\nPanel fencing, Rohn type fence, and even corrugated metal roof panels can also be used, each having their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n, Use the distance around the rubbish pile allowing for a buffer (clear area immediately inside the fence) to estimate the number of posts and the amount of fencing you will need. Since the fence run may not be straight from corner to corner ( it is very likely you may choose to circle the pile, depending on its shape), it may be difficult to get an exact length for the finished fence.\n\n, Use a stout post here, since you may be stretching\/pulling chainlink\/wire mesh from it, and it will also have a gate hanging from it. \u00a0Dig your post hole to a suitable depth (30 inches is common, depending on how firm your ground is), set the post in the hole, and fill in around it, packing the dirt as you do so.\n\n, \u00a0This distance may be shorter if the pile is small and you follow the circumference of it, so adjust as needed.\n\n, About three or four posts from your gate, you will want to measure the distance so you have fairly equal spacing and the final post hits where it should for the gate to fit. Finish installing and packing your posts, and you will be ready to install the fencing material.\n\n, Lift sections of wire up to each post, pulling it tight and attaching it as you go, until you reach the opposite gate post. Since we haven't specified what type post you are using, you will either be nailing the wire with fence staples or tying it with wires, but either way, make sure it is securely fastened.\n\n, Now, nail fence boards to these, standing upright, and continuing around the rubbish pile.\n\n, \u00a0Privacy fence will not require anything, but chainlink or wire fabric may require you add material, either vinyl slats or a plastic mesh fabric made for this purpose to hide the rubbish pile.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":655}

{"text":" Most dorms have the laundry away from main living quarters, so you need to have everything together. Be sure to check that you've taken all your soiled clothes from your workout or sports bag as well as towels, sheets, pillowcases and duvet covers if necessary. This includes:\n\n\nDirty laundry bag or basket\nLaundry detergent--do not use other soaps, such as dish soap, hand soap or body wash. These can cause severe over-sudsing, do not work well, and can cause severe skin irritation).\nStain remover (optional) Softener or softening dryer sheets (store-bought or homemade) ).\nCash or swipe card, as appropriate.\nSecurity card or key - even if your roommate says he or she will be around.;\n, Have quarters or small bills (if there is a change machine) or a pre-paid student card if needed. It usually costs about $2-$2.50 to wash and dry each load. It will typically take one load per week of dirty clothes but this will vary widely depending on your own needs., If you haven't done so already, do it now. If you don't have a stain remover, use a few drops of laundry soap on the stain and rub it in using the fabric around the stain.Only use a bleach pen on white clothing!\n\n, A pen or lipstick tube can easily ruin all of your clothes. You also don't want your cell phone to go through the wash.\n\nBefore leaving for the laundry room do NOT forget your room key.\n\n, These can usually be identified by having the top or lid being raised, showing an empty washer. You can check machines that are not running. Do not remove another person's clothes unless there is really no other machines available. Remember to leave the lid raised for others after you are done.\n\n, If someone else put bleach in the machine and didn't wash anything, your clothes could be ruined. If someone left soap in the dispenser--bonus!--unless you are sensitive to certain detergents. If there is bleach or soap remaining relocate to another washer.\n\n, Sort your laundry into piles:\"Lights\" usually refers to white cottons or cotton blends, light colors like yellows and bright greens or anything that can be washed without damage in hot water. This will also include your towels and sheets (unless sheets are dark colored).\n\"Darks\" usually include dark colors that will fade after repeated washings or fabrics that should not (or do not have to) be washed in hot water. If in doubt, (like a red and white striped shirt) always choose a colder temperature. Blue jeans should be washed with the darks.\nRed and purple fabrics in particular have a nasty habit of releasing dye into the wash and turning white items pink. Put the reds, pinks, oranges, etc. in a separate load, or, if you only have reds, wash them in with the dark clothing. Some people report the same issues with lime or yellow-green clothing.\n\"Delicates\" include things that need special, delicate washing. This includes wool sweaters, bras, tights or nylons, silk shirts, swimsuits, and knits. The care label will usually indicate these items if you are unsure. Sometimes these can be combined with darks in a cool wash if the washer is not too loaded.\n\n, The agitation in the washer will cause them to fade and\/or become damaged over time. Also secure the drawstrings on items like hoodies, track pants and gym shorts so that they do not get pulled out during washing and drying.\n\n, It is a warm soak and gentle agitation followed by a cold water rinse.\n\n, Put a capful of detergent in the machine for a large load, or as directed by the detergent instructions and then close the lid to begin washing.\n\n\nTry to fill the machine about 3\/4 of the way to the top. Allow room for clothes to agitate during the wash cycle.\nDistribute laundry weight evenly (if a top loading washer). A heavy blanket or coat may unbalance the washing drum. You may have to balance the load by with other items on the other side. Be careful of small, heavy items that may cause this problem.\n\n, You will have between 35-45 minutes to just hang out and make sure no one takes your laundry out of the machine. Don't leave your laundry defenseless--thieves steal from laundry rooms routinely. Do your homework.\n\n, Two laundry loads will usually equal one dryer load. Do not overfill as this will cause the drying to take much longer. It is better to use two dryers for 30-40 minutes than one for 90 minutes.\n\n\nWhites such as cotton T-shirts, sheets and towels will usually take a normal\/high setting,\nDarks will usually be on a medium setting. You can use a higher setting if you're washing lots of dark cottons.\nFine washables should be either air-dried, line-dried, or dried on the lowest setting available. If in doubt, dry at a lower setting or air-dry if possible as shrinking of clothes usually happens in the dryer.\n\n, Wipe off any lint present (it should come off easily) and throw it into the recycling bin. Return the lint trap back to its place.\n\n, These give a fresher smell to your clothes and prevent static electricity between garments.\n\n, Choose your settings for the dryer (heavy, normal, light)\n\n, Get comfortable as you may have between 30-60 minutes to chill and wait for your clothes. Do more homework.\n\n, This may mean either putting them on hangers or folding appropriately. Folding pants and shorts right away will reduce the bulk you will have to carry back up. If you fold jeans and slacks the way you would want them pressed (flat front or with a crease down the middle of the front) directly out of the dryer then they will likely not need to be ironed later (depending on the fabric composition).\n\n, Make sure you didn't forget any socks, loose change, or other small items in the machine.\n\n, Put them away and then bask in the glory of fresh clean laundry.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":658}

The hot-zones also show the approximate projected path of the thrown ball.\n\nThe zones where the player is great at hitting is indicated in a red coloring. The zone the player tends to miss pitches is indicated in blue, and when the player has a 50-50 chance of hitting this zone is indicated in white.\n\n\nThe background remains unclickable throughout the entire game.\nThe background of a spring training game is generically made, since the MLB doesn't have these illustrations to show it's users.\nRead the results of each pitch thrown. Balls are denoted in green, strikes are denoted in red, and blue icons denote pitches thrown that resulted in a hit ball to somewhere that was on the playing field which is\/was playable.\nUnderstand about the makeup of what shirts these players are shown to wear are made to represent. The shirts the players on the screen are wearing, are supposed to look identical to the ones the player is wearing in real-life.\n\nLook at what the player looks like. Along with the current jersey that look's like the current batter's jersey, you can also observe the side the player is currently batting from.

{"text":" These animals are used to staying on the ground, so it is better to have a long terrarium than a tall one.\n\n,, You can ask a vet or pet shop owner if you're not sure what these are or where you can find them.\n\n, You can also help maintain humidity levels by adding coconut husk, fern tree bark, or orchid bark in with your substrate mix. You can buy the moss at a local pet store. You shouldn't use the moss you find in your backyard as it contains parasites that are potentially dangerous to your frog.\n\n, The reason the dish should be shallow is because these frogs can't swim very well. The dish needs to be big enough to have the frog's whole body in the dish with room to move around.\n\n,,,, You can buy a plastic log at a local pet store, but you can also make your own. Go and find a hollow log, soak it in water, cut it in half and take out the middle. Make sure the frog can fit under it and travel through it. It doesn't have to be wide enough or long enough to fill the whole tank. Also make certain that the log was never treated with chemicals of any kind.\n\n,, Heating is best supplied by an under tank heater as overhead incandescent bulbs can be too drying. Humidity should be kept at or near 80%\u201390%).\n\n,, This should be set to a 12 hour photoperiod.\n\n, You may wish to choose to buy one of these from be beginning or start off with a 5 gallon (18.9\u00a0L). Since they rarely move, tanks larger than 15 gallons (56.8\u00a0L) will be unnecessary.;\n, The heat pad should be put at the bottom of the cage on the outside so when it is burrowing, the pacman doesn't burn itself.\n\n, The reason for getting the background is, it makes the animal feel more enclosed and feel like it's in the natural environment if you get a background that looks like a rain forest. Another boost to the background is it makes the cage seem more visually appealing to the viewer. Always put the background on the outside of the cage.\n\n, The substrate should be coco fiber or coco husk. These are also known as echo earth or bed a beast. You shouldn't use stones or moss because it may cause impaction that could kill your pacman and you wouldn't want that. This substrate is cheap but needs to be changed monthly and sprayed twice a day.\n\n, The water dish should be big enough for your frog to fit in and move around and still have space. Make sure the dish is shallow because these animals are not very good swimmers and can drown. Make it shallow so your pacman can get in and out of the water dish easily. Dig and put it down into the substrate but make sure the substrate is staying out of the dish. Make sure the water dish doesn't take up too much space though. Remember that frogs don't drink like dogs, they absorb it through their permeable skin.\n\n, The water has to be un chlorinated\u00a0 or the chemicals in tap water can kill your frog. You can use tap water though if you have some water conditioner meant for reptiles, this water conditioner breaks down the chlorine and chloramines that can kill your frog. Water conditioner can be found at a local pet store.\n\n, This hiding place helps the frog because the frog has a place to get out of the light if it wants to. It also lives in the tank. Know this is when most people make a mistake, they buy something that isn't big enough for the frog to fit in and just waste money. Another one of the mistakes people tend to do will be to go outside and find things to put in the tank as hiding places but you can only do that if you put the thing into boiling water and put it in the oven at three fifty for thirty minutes.\n\n, These fake plants add effects to the cage and also creates more places for the pacman to hide and makes the cage look nicer. You shouldn't use real plants because they don't last that long and some are poisonous to the pacman and can cause your pacman to die.\n\n,,,,,,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":662}
{"text":" Biscuits need to cook quickly to puff up, allowing the outside to crisp while the inside stays soft, flaky and doughy. High heat will accomplish this with flying colors.;\n, The butter needs to be hard when it is cut into the four. This keeps it in hard layers that separate the flour, creating the flaky biscuit layers as the butter quickly melts, forming air pockets in the biscuit. This only happens with cold, near-frozen butter.\n\n\nIf you don't have a pastry knife, a capital D-shaped tool with 4-5 thin wire blades, you can put your two best kitchen knives in the freezer as well.\n\n, Grab your 2 cups flour, 1\/4 teaspoon baking soda, 1 tablespoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt. and mix them together in a large mixing bowl. Use a fork, whisk, or mesh strainer to get any clumps out.\n\n\nEven consistency (no lumps) and well mixed dry ingredients will lead to better biscuits every time.\n\n, Your goal is to cut the butter into small, thin chunks without heating it up too much. This coats all the butter in flour and creates air pockets. As such, you want to keep your hands away from it as much as possible, otherwise, you'll get dense, unenjoyable biscuits. The final mixture should have smaller, 1\/2 cm cuts of butter and resemble a crumb topping on a pie. You have a few options, but should always work quickly to avoid extra heat:\n\n\n\nPastry Knife: This tool has several thin wire blades, letting you easily cut the butter into small pieces quickly, with minimal friction. It is a D-shaped tool.\n\nManual Cutting: Take your two sharpest knives and use them to make X-shaped cuts into the bottom of the bowl, sifting to get the butter near the blades and cut effectively.\n\nFood Processor: Go gently, on the lowest setting, stopping when you still have relatively large (1\/2 - 1cm in width) chunks of butter.\n\n, Start with a cup, but know that you may want to add a little more if the dough is sticky and hard to work with. Remember to work with cold buttermilk, not room temperature, to keep the butter from melting.\n\n\n\nNo Buttermilk? No problem! Substitute 1 cup milk + 1 TB lemon juice or vinegar, or substitute a cup of plain, full-fat yogurt., You want to stir as gently, and as little, as possible. Use your fingers to start working in the flour at the edge of the well. Slowly incorporate more and more flour in with a gently scooping motion, pulling flour from the outside into the center. Never knead biscuit dough unless you want hard, dense cakes.When done, you want a shaggy, loose, and wet dough. It should be a bit sticky, and not fully formed. This is good.\nYou will have to do some light pressing and mixing to get all the liquid in, but try to do as little work as possible to get a roughly consistent ball of dough.\n\n, Sprinkle some flour on a large cutting board or other kitchen surface and plop the dough down. Pour any shaggy bits of dough on top of the dough before working.\n\n, You can massage the dough from the edges out or use a rolling pin to evenly spread it out. Either way, take your time for the best biscuits. Physically working dough creates breaks down flour, creating rubbery strands of gluten that lead to denser, heavier breads.\n\n\nSprinkle some flour on your hands or the rolling pin to prevent sticking.\nFor now, don't worry about a perfectly even thickness. Just keep working it until it is close, then move on.\n\n, Again, work slowly, methodically, and without excess force. Don't worry about getting it just perfect.\n\n\nIf the dough is sticking to the surface, add a little flour and flip it over to work on the other side.\n\n, More folds equal more flakes, but there is a limit -- too much folding can lead to you overworking the dough. Everyone has their own preferences and style, so the best thing to do is stick to 4-5 total folds the first time, testing the biscuits, and adjusting next time.\n\n\nWhen done, you should have a nice square of dough, roughly 1\/2 inch thick.\n\n, You can use a knife or a specialty cutter, but the floured rim of a drinking glass makes perfectly shaped biscuits every time. Note that, in general, smaller biscuits are easier to cook to perfection, since they take less time and retain their moist interior better.\n\n\nDon't twist the cutter as you pull it out of the dough. This seals up the edges of the biscuit, which need to be open to get air and steam inside., The first batch you cut out will always be best, but the \"scrape\" dough is still delicious. You could also try a few \"drop\" biscuits, which are shaggy, barely formed balls of dough that resemble scones more than their flat biscuit brethren., If you have parchment paper or a nonstick, oven-safe pan, this will do as well. How you place your biscuits, as well, will impact the final product:\n\n\n\nFor higher, taller biscuits place the biscuits so that they are touching, preferably also touching the edges of a lipped pan or dish. Cast-iron pans work well.\n\nFor wider, shorter biscuits separate the biscuits by 1-2 inches apiece., This can help them develop the wonderful golden brown sheen of the best biscuits. It also doesn't hurt the taste, giving them added richness. For truly decadent bakers, you can also drizzle a little sugar into the butter for a sweet kick.\n\n\nIn a pinch, a light brush of water, milk, or a whipped egg will also help them cook with a crispy golden top., When done, the tops and sides should be golden brown. The sides will be yellow-white, and still a little soft. If you have an uneven cooking oven, or just want to be sure they cook well, quickly turn them once while cooking.\n\n\nPut them on the highest rack possible for the best, most golden-brown tops., Biscuits are meant, always, to be served hot, and they lose their wonder when they cool. Still, give them 2-3 minutes out the oven to finish cooking, let the steam build up the flakes inside, and prevent burnt tongues.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":663}

If it is too short, you won't be able to use your candle. Don't worry if it is too long; you will trim it down later, after the candle sets.\n\n, The wick should be sandwiched between the two sticks. This will hold the wick straight up while you pour the wax., Fill a large saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place it on a stove. Place a spouted melting pot inside the saucepan. You can buy spouted melting pots from the candle making section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, use a heat-safe, glass measuring cup instead.\n\n, Use a candy or cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature. You can use wax flakes or wax cubes. How much wax you melt will depend on how big your mold is. Plan on having some extra wax handy for the second pour, however, as the wax will sink into the sand.\n\n\nDon't add any color or fragrance into the wax yet. The high temperature may change the color and ruin the scent.\nNever leave the melting wax unattended.\nIf your wax has specific melting instructions, follow those instead. Some waxes have a lower melting and ignition point.\n\n, Don't be alarmed if the wax starts to sink into the sand. You will add more wax later.\n\n\nConsider pouring the wax over the back of a spoon to prevent too much splattering.\nKeep your face away from the mold and wax; there may be some splattering.\n\n, As the wax sets, it will sink into the sand. This is normal, and is what creates that sandy shell.,, Because you are using a lower temperature, you don't have to worry about the color or scent changing.Try using some ocean or tropical-themed scents, such as:\n\n\nOcean breeze\nCoconut\nOrchid\nPomegranate\n\n, Again, keep your face away from the mold and wax, in case of any splattering. Because your mold is already filled with a wax shell, this second pouring of wax won't sink into the sand as much.\n\n, If you pull the candle out too soon, the sand may not stick properly.\n\n, Use a spoon to loosen the sand around the candle, then carefully lift the candle out.\n\n, This will prevent the candle from making a mess on your table when you use it. Depending on how hot your wax was, you may have a subtle sand texture, or a thick shell of sand.\n\n, You can do this with a small spoon. Try doing some organic designs, such as swirls and loops.\n\n, If it is too long, it will become a fire hazard.\n\n, If th candle wobbles too much, turn the candle over and look at the bottom. If you see any lumps or bumps, you will need to smooth them out using a knife.\n\n, Always place a candle stand under your candle to catch any drips or melted wax.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":664}

{"text":" If a creditor has forgiven or discharged a debt, then that creditor should send you a 1099-C tax form. This form reports the amount of the debt that was discharged. Receiving this form provides notice to you that the creditor has also reported that amount to the IRS., When you receive a 1099-C form, check it carefully. Make sure that the amount that is reported matches your records. If you believe the form is incorrect, contact the creditor who sent it to you. The creditor may need to make a correction and file an amendment with the IRS.If the creditor is continuing to try to collect from you, then the 1099-C form is premature. You need to contact the creditor to resolve this problem. In this situation, the creditor should either withdraw the 1099-C or give you a signed statement that makes clear that the debt is forgiven.\n\n, Reporting the forgiven debt with a 1099-C form is the creditor\u2019s responsibility. However, even if the creditor neglects to report the forgiven amount, it is still your responsibility to report the forgiven or discharged amount as income. It will not be a valid defense to say that you did not receive a 1099-C.Before reporting that the debt has been canceled, you must confirm the cancellation is valid.\nIf you need to know the actual amount of the forgiven debt, you should contact the creditor directly to verify.\nNote that private individuals are not included in the definition of creditors who are required to provide 1099-C reports. Nevertheless, if an acquaintance of yours canceled a debt that you owed him or her, you will most likely not receive a 1099-C. You still need to report that canceled debt as income.\nNote that a 1099-C is only required for canceled debts of $600 or more. However, this does not mean that you don\u2019t have to report something less. If a bank canceled a debt of $500, you would not receive a 1099-C, but the amount is probably still income.\n\n, If the cancellation of a debt was intended to be a gift, then you do not have to report it as income. This definition of gift also includes an inheritance or bequest.There is no formal definition of \"gift\" for this purpose. If you owed a debt to your parents of, for example, $3,000, and when your birthday came around they gave you a card that said, \"Consider your debt paid off,\" this would pretty clearly be a \"gift.\"\nCalling a cancellation a \"gift\" does not always make it one. Suppose you owed money to your employer, and he or she said you did not have to repay it, and the employer subsequently sent you a 1099-C form for the amount. You cannot unilaterally declare this to be a gift. Under the circumstances, this looks more like a canceled business debt, which is taxable.\nMany employers treat any payments to an employee (or cancellation of a financial obligation) as compensation on a W-2. For this reason, you need to be sure you are not double reporting a payment as both compensation and forgiveness of debt.\n\n, Some student loans can be forgiven in exchange for your working in a particular field after graduation, without creating reportable income. These loans must have been provided by your educational institution, a registered nonprofit organization, or by the government to be forgiven. The exception is that loans forgiven by an educational institution in exchange for services provided to that institution must be reported as income.For example, under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program, educational loans may be forgiven to graduates who provide health care in areas where there is a shortage of trained healthcare professionals. This would not be reportable income.\nAs another example, if you agree to do work or provide services for your college or university, and in exchange the college forgives a portion of your tuition loan, this is considered income and must be reported.\n\n, Some payments for professional services, such as accounting for tax preparation, can be deductible. If your accountant forgives some of the debt you owe him, you may not have to report the forgiven debt if you would have deducted the amount anyway., Suppose you enter into an agreement to buy a home for $300,000, and you pay $200,000 up front. The seller agrees to let you pay the remaining $100,000 over time. Then (for whatever reason), the seller agrees to reduce the price of the house to $250,000. Your debt is reduced by $50,000, but in this case the reduced debt is not income. It is just considered a retroactive change to the price of the house., If you filed bankruptcy and received a discharge of debts, the total amount of the discharged debt is considered income. You must report it as part of your tax return, but you will not have to pay taxes on it.You will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1a. You will report the amount of the discharged debt on Line 2. Attached Form 982 when you submit your tax return.\n\n, The term insolvent in this case means that the total amount of your assets (house, car, bank accounts, property, all added together) is less than the total amount of your debts (mortgage, car payments, school loans, credit card bills, etc.). Subtracting these two totals will tell you the amount of your insolvency.For example, if your total assets add up to $8,000, but you have debts of $15,000, then your insolvency is $7,000. For calculating insolvency, it does not matter if you are able to make your required monthly payments.\nYou will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1b. On Line 2, report the amount of the canceled debt, or the amount of your insolvency, whichever is less.\n\n, If you make more than half of your living from farming, and you received a canceled debt, you may be able to exclude this from taxable income. The formula for calculating the allowable exclusion is fairly technical, so you should consult with an accountant to see if this will apply.To report an exclusion for canceled farm debt, you need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1c. On Line 2, report the amount of the qualified canceled farm debt.\n\n, You may be allowed to exclude forgiven or canceled mortgage debts, if the mortgage was on property that you used as a business or as your principal residence, and the money from the loan was used to make improvements to the property. In this case, if the creditor canceled all or part of your mortgage loan, that amount is income that you can exclude.You will need to get IRS Form 982 and check the box on Line 1d if this was a business property. Check the box on Line 1e if it was for your residence. Report the allowable amount of the canceled debt exclusion on Line 2.\nCalculating the allowable exclusion in this category can be technical. You should speak with an accountant.\n\n, After you have considered all of the previous categories of exceptions or exclusions, any canceled debt that still remains must be reported as income.\n\n, When you complete your tax return, you will report the amount of the forgiven debt on Form 1040, Line 21. This is the space for \u201cOther Income.\u201d On the blank line, you should write in the phrase \u201cForgiven Debt\u201d and then report the amount.This report will be the amount of forgiven debt that you have not already decided is either an exception or an exclusion.\n\n, You will still report the forgiven debt income on line 21 as \u201cOther Income.\u201d On the blank line, you should write in the phrase \u201cForgiven Debt\u201d and then report the amount., If the canceled debt was related to business operations, you will report it on Schedule C instead of at Line 21 of Form 1040. You will report the canceled debt income on Line 6 of Schedule C. File Schedule C along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR.\n\n, As long as the rental property is not used for farming, you will use Schedule E. Report the canceled debt on Line 3 of Schedule E. File Schedule E along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR.\n\n, If you are a farmer and the canceled debt is related to your farm operations, you will report it on Schedule F, line 8. File Schedule F along with your Form 1040 or 1040-NR.\n\n\nIf the canceled debt is related to farming on a rental property, you will report the income on Form 4835, Line 6.\n\n, You are not eligible to use the shortened Form 1040-EZ if you have any income that is other than W-2 wages or simple interest. If you have a forgiven debt, you will need to use Form 1040., If you use a commercially available computer program to complete your taxes, such as TurboTax, TaxAct, or TaxSlayer (there are others), the program should ask you if you have any 1099-C income to report. A good program will ask you for enough details to determine if the canceled debt is an exception, an exclusion, or is reportable income. The program will then generate the appropriate forms.If you believe that you may have taxable income from a canceled debt, but your tax software does not seem to ask about it, you should contact the customer support service for your software program.\n\n, The official website of the Internal Revenue Service is https:\/\/www.irs.gov.

{"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n,, Soak the rag and give the base a couple of good wipe downs until you don't see any more dirt, wax, etc. being lifted. ***WARNING!!!*** Base cleaner is VERY VERY VERY flammable stuff. DO NOT use anywhere near ANY type of open flame or ignition source. It is best to do all of this outdoors or in a very well ventilated area. Base cleaner will also damage plastic, so keep it away from any plastic, like your snowboard's sidewalls and bindings. Light cleaning such as removing sticker glue, etc., on the board\u2019s top sheet will usually be okay and not cause any damage in my experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, from the base. Try NOT to dig all the way down to the wood core because that's an all together different repair that involves a different type of p-tex wax with an adhesive or using epoxy to repair the core damage before applying the p-tex. Re-wipe it down with acetone. Wait a good 10 minutes before proceeding to ensure there are no lingering base cleaner fumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,, (Remember to watch your torch so nothing catches fire accidentally.) Hold your metal scraper under the candle's flame and continually scrape all of the black soot from the melting candle before applying it to the repair area. Now, contrary to what you may have been taught, instead of dripping the candle into the repair, it is better to \"paint\" the molten Ptex wax into the repair area using a paint brush, all the while striving for a BLUE flame, and again, continually scraping all the black soot from the burning candle before painting into the repair area. If you DO get black soot in the repair, you can usually just paint it out of the repair. Repeat until all your gouges are filled. Let board cool at least 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Angle the scraper's bottom edge AWAY from you at about 45 degrees (with the top edge leaning back TOWARDS you) and PUSH it AWAY from you with even pressure, until the repaired areas are all flat. (You can PUSH or PULL the scraper, whichever works best for you, as long as it doesn't jitter, leaving \"speed bumps\" in your repaired area.) Don't worry about any minute scrapes made by the scraper. They are taken care of in the next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,,, But, if no tool is available, then hold your file against the side edge at a 90 degree angle (remember, the snowboard is still base up) and use long strokes with an even pressure (not too hard) and use the file from tip to tail(as always with a metal file). Now place the file on the base, across the edge, at a 45 degree angle, making sure the teeth are in the proper position to cut against the base's edge. Again, the key is to use even pressure with long strokes as opposed to short ones that will leave an uneven pattern on the edge. ***Also make SURE you clean the file every 2-3 strokes so no new base damage is created.***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, created by filing. You may have to lightly dig out any filings left in the base to ready it for the second waxing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, ***IMPORTANT*** Adjust the temperature until any wax wiped on it melts BUT DOES NOT SMOKE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Place the iron on the base and start spreading the wax evenly until the base is evenly coated with no dry spots. ***IMPORTANT*** DO NOT leave the iron in any one spot for over one second as the heat buildup will damage your board. When finished let the board cool for a good 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This time scraping until no more wax shavings come off and the base is left with a flat surface and uniform shine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, What this does is create microscopic channels that prevent water suction that will slow you down.

{"text":" You may experience pain while sitting or during sexual intercourse, or sometimes no pain at all, only swelling. If you suspect that you may have a Bartholin cyst, it is important to see your family doctor for a pelvic exam to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n\nIn addition to a pelvic exam, your doctor will likely test for STIs (sexually transmitted infections).\nThis is because, if you have an STI in conjunction with your Bartholin cyst, you are at higher risk of having your cyst become infected (and you will likely be given antibiotic treatment \u2014 more on this later).\nIf you are over 40 years old, your cyst may also be biopsied to rule out the possibility of cancer of the female reproductive system.;\n, A Sitz bath is when you fill the bathtub with just enough water to cover your buttocks and vagina when you sit down in the water. The water does not need to be any deeper than that, although it can be, if you would like. (This depends on personal preference, and whether you are aiming to make the bath an enjoyable experience, or simply one of convenience.)\n\n\nYou should have a Sitz bath at least 3 to 4 times per day.\nThe purpose of regular Sitz baths is to keep the area around the Bartholin cyst clean, to reduce pain and\/or discomfort in the area, and also to increase the chances of the cyst naturally draining itself.\n\n, If your Bartholin cyst does not naturally drain itself and resolve with Sitz baths after several days, you may want to see your doctor to discuss the possibility of surgical drainage. The reason that it is important to discuss treatment options sooner rather than later is that, if the cyst does not resolve, it may become infected and form what is called an \"abscess.\"This is more complicated to treat than a simple cyst, so it is best to be proactive.\n\n\nIf you are under 40 and you the cyst is asymptomatic (no pain, fever, etc.), then often no medical intervention is necessary.\nIf you notice signs of a fever alongside your Bartholin cyst, see your doctor for treatment.\nTo prevent your cyst from becoming infected, use condoms during sex, particularly if you are unsure whether your partner has an STI; however, it is not necessary to refrain from sex., You can purchase over-the-counter pain medications at your local pharmacy or drugstore. Some common choices include:\n\n\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin) 400 \u2013 600 mg every four to six hours as needed.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) 500 mg every four to six hours as needed.\n\n, You can see your family doctor, who may do it themselves (if they are experienced with the procedure). Alternatively, they may refer you on to another physician to have the procedure performed.\n\n\nMost cases of incision and drainage are outpatient procedures done in the doctor's office and only require local anesthetic.\nAn incision (opening) will be made in your cyst, allowing any fluid inside to drain out.\nA catheter (tube) may be placed into the cyst for up to six weeks following the procedure. This is usually only done for cases of recurrent Bartholin cysts.\nThe purpose of the catheter is to keep the cyst open, so that any further fluid that accumulates can drain out immediately.\nKeeping the cyst open prevents fluid buildup and, as such, allows the cyst to naturally heal.\n\n, It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, and to not miss taking any of the pills, as missing pills will lessen the effectiveness of the antibiotics.\n\n\nAlso, if you test positive for any STIs, you will receive antibiotics whether or not your cyst is currently infected.\nThe purpose to prevent an infection, as testing positive for STIs heightens your risk that your cyst may subsequently become infected.\n\n, If your Bartholin cyst recurs, you can speak to your physician about a procedure called marsupialization. This is when the cyst is surgically drained, and then stitches are placed on either side of the cyst to hold it open following the procedure.This opening is permanent, and serves to prevent recurrences of the Bartholin cyst.\nYou will likely have a catheter (tube) in for a few days following the surgical procedure; however, after that, the catheter can be removed because the stitches will be strong enough to keep the incision open.\n\n, Both of these are simple procedures that do not require an overnight hospital stay.\n\n, Doctors do recommend that you begin treatment \u2014 either home treatment or medical treatment \u2014 as quickly as possible once you notice a cyst developing.\n\n, Again, this is to ensure that the area remains clean, and to maximize healing while minimizing the risk of infection.\n\n\nSitz baths are advised beginning one to two days following the surgical procedure.\n\n, For as long as the catheter remains in, it is key to refrain from sexual intercourse.\n\n\nAbstaining from sex for that time period will also help to prevent your cyst from becoming infected.\nAfter marsupialization, even though there is no catheter, you will be advised to refrain from sex for four weeks following the procedure to ensure full healing.\n\n, Alternatively, if your pain is more severe, you may ask your doctor for prescription strength pain medications (narcotics) such as Morphine in the initial stages of recovery.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":671}
{"text":" These are listed below in \"Things You'll Need\". Look for supplies in large box stores that stock craft items as well as craft shops and hobby stores.\n\nChildren working on this project will require the help and supervision of an adult, as sharp scissors and an oven will be used. The aid of an adult may be needed for certain steps which require attention to small details. The time it takes to complete this project will include three minutes for baking and between 15 and 30 minutes for fusing.;\n, This is currently only available as a PDF file which you can find at http:\/\/www.2shared.com\/document\/T9COyD5v\/bakugan_pendant_pattern2.html. The download link is near the bottom of the page (see image). Once you have the PDF file, print it out full-size on a regular piece of letter-size paper., First, tape the pattern down (printed side face-up) onto the surface of your workspace. Then, place a sheet of Shrinky Dinks plastic (frosted side up!) on top of the pattern, and tape it down at the edges as well. This will help to keep both pieces in place as you work., Notice that there are six different pendant patterns on the page, one for each attribute of Bakugan. You will only be tracing the outside line of this pattern for this step., Try to only fill in the space inside the lines; when the plastic is baked later, the painted areas will puff out slightly and fill out the design more. Allow the paint to dry before continuing on to the next step.\n\nIf the marker is new, or isn't painting well, you will need to prime it; shake the marker up and down for a couple of minutes (you should eventually hear the agitator sliding back and forth inside the marker), then press the marker tip down onto a scrap piece of thick paper or cardboard so that the tip retracts into the marker. Paint will start to flow into the spongy tip. It will easily make a mess, so be careful when doing this step!\n\n, Allow this to dry before going on to the next step., This piece will remain blank, and will be used later on during fusing as the bottom piece which seals the design is inside the pendant. Simply tracing the outer edge of an adjacent pattern to get this piece saves you from having to move and re-tape the plastic.,, Remember to cut only along the pencil lines that mark the outer edges of these pieces., Make sure to remove all of the pencil marks; they will not be included in the final piece. Also be sure to keep the pieces clean from eraser filings resulting from erasing., Preheat the oven to 325\u00baF (163\u00baC) and allow it to warm up as you prepare the cookie sheet. Take the parchment paper and cut a piece that covers the cookie sheet. Then, take the pendant pieces and lay them frosted side up on the paper as shown in the picture. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, go on to the next step., As they bake, they will shrink (they are Shrinky Dinks after all) as well as become nine times thicker.\n\nIt is important to watch them during this process as they run the danger of curling up and sticking to themselves, thus preventing them from flattening out properly. Grab a chair and sit where you can see the pieces as they draw up, and keep the pair of wooden skewers or chopsticks on hand to reach into the oven and pull the pieces apart if they start curling into themselves. (Children should have an adult do this.)\nOnce the 3 minutes have passed, take the cookie sheet out of the oven and lay it on a heat-safe surface (or potholders) and allow the pieces to cool. Then, turn the oven temperature up to 450\u00baF (230\u00baC) and allow it to heat up. While you're waiting, work on the next step.\n\n, This tiny piece of wire will be fused inside the pendant and will be used to hang it from a necklace chain. See the photos at right for how to bend the wire and cut off the excess with the jewelry pliers (you will need to bend the wire a bit at the non-loop end so that it cannot be easily yanked out of the pendant after fusing). The wire must not be so long that it extends past the silver \"finial\" into the clear part of the pendant, but also not so short that you can't get a lot of bends into it., Get the Pyrex dish and begin layering the pieces inside it. The blank piece is laid frosted side down on the glass first; the eye loop is then laid at one end of the blank piece, then the painted piece is laid frosted side down with the top end on top of the eye loop. A flat toothpick is placed under the exposed part of the eye loop to keep it from touching the glass., During this time, the top piece will melt into the bottom piece, turning them into a single piece. The frosted surfaces will flatten, causing the pendant to turn clear.\n\nCheck the pendant after 15 minutes to see if the fusing has completed; it is likely that the silver-painted ends will still need a few more minutes to fuse. Once you are satisfied with the result, remove the dish from the oven and set it on a heat-safe surface. The dish must be cool to the touch before moving on to the next step!\n\n, Grab the pendant near the middle with the thumb and index fingers of both hands, and gently wiggle it back and forth, gradually applying more pressure, until it comes loose from the dish. There may be some clear plastic left on the dish where the edges of the pendant touched the glass; this can be easily removed with a safety razor., Your pendant may end up with some sharp or jagged edges where it was touching the glass. Use the fine-grain sandpaper to dull these edges. Be careful not to scratch the smooth plastic on top of the pendant., Remember to open the ring by bending it sideways, instead of pulling it open., Simple enough. Afterwards, close the jump ring. Alternatively, you could close the jump ring first (bending it sideways until the ends meet), then undo the chain and slide it through the ring., Wear it to your next Bakugan tournament meet and impress your opponents.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":672}

{"text":" It appears the same, but you'll probably have less tell-tale nervous eyes. You might wear a hoodie\/silly hat and shades; so they can't see your \"tells\" as easily, when you're playing weak or strong, but trying to look consistent.;\n, Do not bluff preflop too often. But, when you have been playing conservatively\/tightly, and it seems like it is your turn to take down a pot -- it can seem real. Playing tight all the time is a form of tilting in their favor, so occasionally play your cards irrationally (for your own reason) and break out of the tight pattern (but don't ever say it's your turn, until you win). Bluffing is a big part of poker.\n\n, Think it through before you say your bet, like what the consequences would be. Be consistent with the hand that you are representing by how you have played previously and think about what present hole cards connect on the board. Heads up, you have A\u2665J\u2663 and your opponent holds A\u2666Q\u2660 with a board of 2\u26639\u26657\u26664\u2663,__, but you had raised preflop; so, your opponent would have put you in a range of high cards or a possibly a pair (but s\/he has no reason to fear a flush or straight with the splits and rainbow board). Your opponent may call or raise your turn bet thinking that both the flop and turn would not make a hand with you probably holding high cards. You also, probably won't fold, naturally thinking, \"ace high is good,\" not knowing that only another J or drawing a Q can make your hand worth anything.\n\n, Heads up, you have 7\u26654\u2665 and the board is Q\u26659\u26636\u2665A\u2666,__ you will usually not get the heart on the river to make that heart flush draw, and you would lose the showdown with your two low cards and three big cards on the board. Even a seven or four, on the river, might not be enough to win. So what -- well, when the ace came on the turn, would be the time to bet representing an ace with a flush draw (the turn and river are like drawing, but everyone gets the same draw) like A\u2665x\u2665 and if your opponent folds more than 3 out of 10 times, your turn bet might be a win (so, note the tendencies of opponents.)\n\n, Don't fiddle with your necklace, tap your foot, or blink too much. It makes you seem guilty.\n\n, Act like you learned your lesson to not bluff; so, do not do this often. By giving action\/bluffing, and revealing a weak hand once, then when you get a great hand later, you will get bluffing action back to build the pot, if they think you are weak\/bluffing again. This is different from when you bet in the big blind (first player past the button) with some trash hand, they accept that. You get a \"free play\" when your hand connects with the flop and afterward, then at the showdown your opponents see your trash hold cards. Always look at the position, in relation to the button, that you and your opponents have.\n\n, The other players could be irritated and spurred on to tilt after this and, so, put more money in the pot than necessary, trying to tempt you to \"Just try bluffing with trash again, buddy.\" But now you should only bet if you're strong, and fold until you have good cards, to take to a river showdown. However, if you hadn't shown those weak cards, just discarded them after everyone folded, you could still seem scary\/more real, and could play more bluffs, by not having stirred up the opponents.\n\n, In each case, you would have to be paying attention to your opponent's play in the hand and prior to the hand to get a read on his hand.\n\n, With high cards there is a possibility of making a top pair with more cards to come on the turn and river, and it would be no shame to go to showdown with high cards without a made hand.\n\n,, Here, you are thinking beyond making the cut, and going for the final table. Trying this buying-in and paying to play each hand can be worthwhile because of the payout structure. Be ready for the rewards and consequences of losing, in this daring play.\n\n,, But otherwise, bluff against fewer opponent rather than many opponents.\n\n, Use this when drawing, for example, but the pot odds are not sufficient. The bluff adds to the overall expectation, because some of the time without your holding good cards, your opponent will fold when you bluff.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":674}
{"text":" You will need a double-sided (coarse and fine grit) synthetic sharpening stone. You will also need a honing steel, which is typically sold in the form of a lightly-grooved, magnetized iron rod. Both of these materials can be found at your local hardware store.\n\n\nSharpening stones have two sides with different grits. The grit measures how rough the stone is, and thus how severely it sharpens. Higher numbers stand for finer grits meaning the lowest number is the roughest surface.;\n, The stone is porous, and it needs to fill with water so that the blade doesn't catch. This decreased friction and helps prevent scratches and nicks.You'll want to keep getting the stone wet as you work, so keep some water nearby.\n\n, You can use a damp towel or a silicon baking sheet or hot pad. You do not want the stone moving as you sharpen, as this is the number one way to accidentally end up in the ER.\n\n, Splash some water on top before beginning. You always start with the rougher side of the stone, with the lower grit rating. Many stones start at F 400 (European measurement) or J 1000 (Japanese measurement).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional chefs may have multiple stones with many different grits to smoothly craft a point. More variety means you can get a better edge by slowly increasing the resistance.\nIf you have a broken tip on the knife, fix this before sharpening.\n\n\n, This can be hard to find, but just do it in pieces. Perpendicular to the stone (blade touching the stone, as if you were cutting), is 90-degrees. Now, angle the blade so that it is halfway between perpendicular and laying on the stone. This is 45-degrees. Now angle the stone to be roughly halfway between this angle and the stone -- you've got it!\n\n\nA steeper angle always leads to a more durable knife, but too steep and you will risk cracking the edge., This hand provides the control and keeps the edge down on the stone as you work., These fingers are your guides, keeping the knife down and moving it smoothly as you work.\n\n\nThese fingers will naturally slide to help the area you're working on since most stones are not big enough to fit the whole knife.\n\n, This motion should be smooth and fluid, almost like you were lightly slicing off an impossibly thin piece of the stone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Friction, when not controlled, is not your friend. Keep the stone wet to prevent accidental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is often a good idea to wipe any grit off the blade each time your wet the stone again\n\n, With your non-dominant hand, move up to the tip of the blade and focus on that. Then slide down and sharpen the meet of the blade before moving down to the hilt. Try to use the same number of movements for each section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't try and push the blade down into the stone. You want it to stay flush to the stone with every pass, but you don't want to be digging it in., You want both sides to be evenly sharpened, otherwise, the knife will be misaligned. The exact same strategy should be used as the first side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel the opposite side of the knife from the one you've been sharpening. If you feel a little burr or catch on the unsharpened side, it means it's time to flip., Make one pass on the right side, flip the knife, and make another on the left. Both the angle and motion are still consistent, as is the need to keep the stone wet. However, since the finer grit is making smaller, finer changes, you want to ensure that you evenly balance them by alternating sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou only need very light pressure down on the knife with the fine grit stone.\nKeep the stone extra wet, and wipe the grit from the knife frequently with a damp towel.\n\n, Take your sharpened knife and \"slice\" down the edge of a wooden cutting board, as if you were trying to cut into it. You only need to do it one -- but simply dragging the blade across the cutting board to clean off he cutting edge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The next step is to use your steel honing rod (sometimes known as a steeling rod), to make sure the blade is properly aligned. Make sure you use a few passes on each side, and keep honing the blade every time you use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":675}
{"text":" Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle of the oven.;\n, This will allow the other ingredients to mix in more evenly later on. You can use a handheld mixer, a stand mixer, or a food processor fitted with whisks to do this.\n\n, Beat everything together on a medium speed setting until the color and texture are even. This will take about 2 minutes.Make sure that you are using plain canned pumpkin, and not the pumpkin pie filling.\n\n, Continue beating on a low speed setting for another minute or so.If you are using a handheld mixer, be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. If you are using a food processor, you may have to pause it every so often, and scrape any unblended mixture down the sides.\n\n\nFor a more complex flavor, add \u00bd teaspoon of ground ginger and \u00bc teaspoon of ground cloves., Lightly grease the bottom and sets of a jelly roll pan. Something that is 15 by 10 by 1-inch (38.1 by 25.4 by 2.54-centimeter) would be ideal. Next, pour the batter into the baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into the pan. If you get any residue in the bowl, use the spatula to scrape it into the pan.\n\n, The pumpkin bars are ready when they turn golden brown on top, and a toothpick poked into the middle comes out clean.\n\n, Do not remove them from the pan and do not cut them. They must be completely cool before you frost them.\n\n, You can do this using a handheld mixer, a stand mixer, or a good processor fitted with whisks. Use a low speed setting, and keep mixing until everything turns smooth.\n\n\nFor a twist, use 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of maple syrup instead of vanilla extract., Keep using a low speed setting, and beat the mixture well after each cup (125 grams) of sugar that you add.\n\n, The icing should be soft and easy to spread. If it is too soft or too hard for you, however, you'll have to make some adjustments. Listed below are some tips and suggestions. After you make your additions, beat the icing well. Keep in mind that the icing will set up a little after you spread it.\n\n\nIf the icing is too thin, add up to \u00bd cup (65 grams) of confectioners' sugar.If the icing is too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of milk.For a richer frosting, use half-and-half instead.If the icing is too sweet, add \u215b teaspoon of salt., Again, do not cut the bars just yet. Simply spread the icing over the top, going from edge to edge. When you are done, you can smooth the icing down further, or smack it with the spatula to great a nice texture.\n\n, Your pumpkin bars are done at this point, but you can shake a sprinkle of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice on top for more color and flavor.You can also scatter up to 1 cup (125 grams) of chopped walnuts on top instead., Once the bars are cut, you can take them out of the pan and serve them. Cover and store any left over pumpkin bars in the fridge, or the icing will get too soft., Measure out the confectioners' sugar, and put it into a large mixing bowl. Add \u00bd teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and 1 pinch of each of the following: cloves, nutmeg, and ginger. Mix the ingredients briskly together until evenly combined.\n\n\nSift the sugar first to break up any clumps.\n\n, Stir everything briskly together using a whisk. Be sure to break up any clumps and to scrape the bottom and the sides of the bowl so that everything gets mixed.\n\n, The glaze should be thin enough to pour over the top of your baked pumpkin bars, but not so thin that it is like water. If the glaze is too thick, add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.If the glaze is too thin, add more confectioners' sugar. Be sure to stir the glaze well after each addition.\n\n, Do not take the bars out of the pan. Simply pour the glaze over the top in an even layer.\n\n, If you have any leftovers, cover them with a sheet of plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":676}

{"text":" You should be counting 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and take one step after each beat. That means you should take a step to the right with your right foot on Count 1. This is the very first step to doing a grapevine to your right.\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/25\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/25\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-1-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, That's why it's called the grapevine -- because you'll be \"weaving\" one foot behind the other. You can also put your arms into it, and pump them forward or upward slightly every time you take a step. In the \"Electric Boogie\" video, you can see that the dancers are really pumping their arms, almost as if they were doing the \"Running Man\" with them; it's up to you how much you want to get into it!\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/3b\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/3b\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-2-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This will uncross your feet.\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/39\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/3\/39\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-3-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Simply tap the ground with your left foot without putting your weight on the foot. You'll be taking your next step with your left foot, so you should keep the weight on the right foot. You can also clap your hands whenever you tap your feet to add some flair to this dance move.\n\/images\/thumb\/f\/fe\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/f\/fe\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations -- you have just completed a grapevine to the right! The grapevine consists of the moves set out in Steps 1-4.\nIf you want to simplify this dance and aren't ready for the grapevine, instead of weaving one foot behind the other, you can instead simply step the right foot to the right, step your left foot to the right to meet your right foot, tap it, and repeat. So you would do a step-tap, step-tap, instead of the grapevine. If this is what you choose, then you should also do this move on the left side.\n\n, You will now begin mirroring the steps laid out in Steps 1-4 on the left side.\n\/images\/thumb\/d\/d1\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/d\/d1\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-5-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c5\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c5\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-6-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This will uncross your feet again.\n\/images\/thumb\/0\/00\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/0\/00\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-7-Version-5.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This time, tap the ground with your right foot while keeping your weight on the left foot. Great work! You have completed the grapevine on your left side.\n\/images\/thumb\/5\/54\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/5\/54\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This begins the process of taking three steps backward and tapping your feet. Just as you did before, count off 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you take your steps.\n\/images\/thumb\/7\/7e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/7\/7e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-9-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\/images\/thumb\/5\/52\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/5\/52\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-10-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\/images\/thumb\/8\/82\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/8\/82\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-11-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Remember to keep that weight on your right foot. To add some flair to your steps, you can add a knee-lift, kick, toe-point-and-hip-lift, or whatever you want with your left foot instead of just tapping your feet closed, as long as you keep your weight off the tapping foot.\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/46\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/46\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/cc\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/cc\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-13-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Many people, instead of tapping with their foot, will kind of do a deep lunge with the left knee, touching (or just reaching for) the floor with their right hand. Others just tap their feet closed.\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/21\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/21\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-14-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, It's like rocking back and forward twice.\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-15-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\/images\/thumb\/e\/ec\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/e\/ec\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-16-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Prepare to turn left, getting your hips and arms ready to do the \"pivot and brush\".\n\/images\/thumb\/0\/06\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/0\/06\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-17-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the original choreography - this is actually a hop - and the turn happens in the air. The brush step was added later.\n\n, This is known as a quarter turn. Turning to the left means that your left shoulder goes back and your right shoulder comes forward. You can kick your right foot up a bit and brush the ground as you transition to the new position; just kick whichever foot is in back to move to the new side, so that it is next to the left foot again. Many will also do a knee lift (with the right knee) and\/or clap their hands here.\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/48\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/4\/48\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-18-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Start with the very first step. Note that you -- and hopefully the rest of the group -- will be facing a new direction each time you repeat, continuing to turn 90 degrees after every 18-step cycle. That's the beauty of the line dance -- once you can do it in one direction, all you have to do is to keep turning and repeating it until the music fades.\n\/images\/thumb\/9\/99\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/9\/99\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-19-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, A \"grapevine\" is a series of sidesteps in one direction, stepping to the side, then crossing in front or behind with the other foot, then stepping to the side again. A more detailed breakdown is below. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine on the right.\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c9\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c9\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-20-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This is just like the grapevine to the right, except it's to the left. Count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the beat of the music and do the grapevine to the left.\n\/images\/thumb\/1\/1e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/1\/1e\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-21-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This part is conceptually similar to the grapevine steps, except going backwards instead of sideways. As before, count 1, 2, 3, 4 to the music as you step.\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c3\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/c\/c3\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-22-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This is the fun little boogie-dip move that you will do to transition between turns.\n\/images\/thumb\/e\/e0\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/e\/e0\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-23-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Count 1, 2 to the beat of the music and repeat the process. Once you've finished, take another quarter turn and repeat until the music is over.\n\/images\/thumb\/9\/97\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg\/v4-550px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg\n\/images\/thumb\/9\/97\/Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg\/v4-300px-Do-the-Electric-Slide-Step-24-Version-3.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":678}
{"text":" You can go to the fabric store to find a comfortable flannel, fleece, muslin, denim or cotton print; however, you can also use socks, old shirts, washcloth or towels. Whatever you choose to use, be sure that it contains no sparkly or metallic threads, wires, bead, etc, as these will catch fire when microwaved later on.\n\n\nA large, thick sock is the easiest cloth to use, since it is already round and you do not need to sew all the sides. You can also use an old hand towel and fold it in half lengthwise, for another easy option.\nIf you choose a loose weave on your fabric, also find or buy a flannel or muslin cloth to use as your inner lining, so your filling does not leak out.;\n, If you do not want to measure, a length of about 20 inches (51 cm) width of 5 inches (13 cm) will work for most necks.\n\n\nIf you want to use the wrap for other parts of your body, like your back, be sure to extend the wrap a few extra inches or cm to make the wrap more versatile.\n\n, People use long grained white rice, flax seed, buckwheat, barley, oatmeal, feed corn, cherry pits, beans or millet seed. If you are making a rice neck wrap, make sure you do not use instant rice, which may cook when heated.\n\n, Although this is not necessary, a relaxing scent can help to relax and remove tension from your body. Choose an essential oil or spice and mix it with your filling of choice in a large bowl. Let the filling sit with the scent for a day or so and stir often to make sure the scent is distributed throughout the grain.\n\n\nFor example, you can use approximately 5 drops of an essential oil like lavender, peppermint or rose. You can also use 5 pinches of spices like cinnamon, cloves or rosemary. You can also mix with rose or other flower petals.\n\n, If you are using a towel or a sock, this will not be necessary. If you plan to have an inner and outer fabric, cut rectangles out of both the lining and cover material, making the lining slightly smaller - about 1\/2 inch (1.3 cm).\n\n, Pin it in place across the open length and both ends so the seams stay together while you sew.\n\n, Make sure your stitches are very close together so small grains of rice do not poke out of the seams.\n\n,\n\n\nIf you are sewing an inner and outer bag, leave 1 end all the way open on the outer bag. You will need to open the outer bag regularly while you heat the inner bag.\n\n,, Experiment with the amount. Most neck wraps are 1\/2 to 3\/4 full. Do not fill it all the way, as the less full it is, the more it will conform to your body.\n\n, Although this 1 inch (2.54 cm) of the seam will face out, it is important to be able to rip this seam out and replace the grain if the bag loses its scent or gets wet.\n\n\nIf you are making an outer bag, hem the 2 sides of the outer bag in and adhere Velcro to each side so that you can open and close it easily.\n\n, If you do not feel it is warm enough, heat in 30 second intervals. Place around your neck and over your shoulders until the neck wrap cools, approximately 20 minutes.\n\n, If you really want to get fancy, make the pillow, and then make a cover for it that can be easily washed, yet removed during the microwaving process. Just remember to make the cover measurements slightly larger in order to accommodate the inner pillow. This makes an excellent gift. Good Luck!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":679}
{"text":" If you are new to string shapes, it can be tricky. The instructions will make more sense to a person who has gotten the hang of it. So, be prepared to start over a few times before it comes easily. It is recommended to try the simple Eiffel Tower before moving on to the elaborate one. Many of the directions in the elaborate method will make more sense if you have tried them out with the simple Eiffel Tower.\n\n, You can use any type of string but it should be at least three feet long for children and at least four feet long for adults.\n\n, It can be hard to scroll down if your hands are 'tied' and no one is around to help you. Before you start making your Eiffel Tower, position your cursor over the 'down' triangle on the scroll bar so you can move from step to step using your palms, pinkie, or elbow to bump the left mouse button. Or, make sure no element on the page is selected so you can bump the down arrow on your keyboard.\n\n\nIf you are using a touch screen device, you should be able to use some part of your hand to scroll down. You might even try using your nose.\n\n, Form a secure knot and then trim off any excess string coming off the ends.You should now have a complete loop of string.\n\n, Begin the string figure by placing the string over both of your thumbs. With your palms facing each other, hook your pinkie fingers under the string so that the string is now looped over them as well. Pull the string tight, but not too tight., This loop should be made on the opposite string where it is going in front of your middle three fingers. Repeat this step with your other hand, taking your pointer finger and hooking the string from the middle of the opposite hand.\n\n\nPull the string figure taut once again.\nHolding your hands vertically, from top to bottom you will see a downward pointing triangle, a diamond, and an upward pointing triangle.\nThis position is called \"open a.\" It is the starting position for many other string figures as well., Pull the string figure tight as you do it, so that you don't lose any other loops.\n\n, There should be four strings running between your hands.\n\n,, Then hook them beneath the second string on your index fingers.\n\n, Once you have dropped them, turn your hands so that your palms are facing up.\n\n, Return your hands to the original position after you have done this, with your palms facing each other.\n\n, You may need to use your teeth if you are new to string figures and your fingers aren't nimble enough for this move yet. Pull the string figure taut. You now are in the string figure called Cat's Whiskers.\n\n, You should now have strings around your pinkies, index fingers and thumbs.\n\n, This top loop should now be on both your right thumb and right index finger.\n\n\nUse the fingers on your left hand to expand and move this loop without dropping the strings they hold. This can be a bit difficult but just do it slowly and carefully.\nRepeat this step on the other hand.\n\n, Be careful to leave the upper loop in place on your thumb. Again, people new to string figures may find using their teeth to be the easiest method for doing this.\n\n\nRepeat this step on the other hand as well.\nYou should see a small triangle form on both of your hands between your right index fingers and thumbs.\n\n, Just simply curve your index fingers and point them down through the holes. Don't pull them back up, just leave them pointing down.\n\n, Rotate your hands 180 degrees around, moving so your thumbs move up. While doing this you will also need to simultaneously take your pinkies out of their loops. The flip of your hands should also release the second loop on your index fingers while keeping the loop you gained from the triangle.\n\n\nYou now have Jacob's Ladder!\nThis is the most difficult step of this method. Don't get discouraged if you mess it up a couple times. Simply keep practicing so that you can master this movement.\n\n, Move the fingers of your top hand together and then pull the whole string figure tight.You should now see the Eiffel Tower before your very eyes!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":680}
{"text":" Plaid comes in many different colors and styles. However, its crisscrossing lines mean it's almost always fairly attention-grabbing. This means pairing multiple pieces of plaid clothing with each other can be overwhelming or \"busy\" to look at.\n\n\nThere's one exception to this rule. If you have one plaid accessory (like a scarf, purse, hat, pair of shades, etc.) that's designed to match your main plaid piece, you can usually get away with wearing both together.;\n, This is a great \"go-to\" style choice when you're trying to add plaid to your wardrobe. Solid colors offer simple contrast to the complicated interwoven patterns of plaid. On top of this, neutral tones are versatile in terms of which plaid patterns they can pair with. Not every plaid shirt will pair with bright yellow chinos, for instance, but most will pair with a simple pair of jeans or khakis quite nicely.\n\n\n\nNeutral colors include: White, black, khaki, muted blue denim, grey, and most browns and beiges., You don't always have to wear plaid with neutral tones. However, if you want to wear plaid with colored clothes, try to pick a plaid piece with one color that is close to the other color in your outfit.\n\n\nFor example, if you're wearing a set of bright blue jeans, you might wear a plaid shirt that includes a few stripes that are a similar shade of blue. The colors don't have to match exactly \u2014 light blue can go with dark blue and so on., Today, clothing sellers offer plaid garments in a huge variety of colors and shades. This means that you have lots of freedom when it comes to assembling your outfit. As long as you're following the color-matching rules above, there aren't any strict rules here, but a few general suggestions are below.\n\n\n\nBrighter, more flowery shades tend to be best for casual events and warmer months.\n\nDarker, more muted shades tend to be more formal and more appropriate for colder weather. For example, you would probably not wear pink plaid to a job interview, but navy blue plaid might work well.\n\nIntricately-stitched patterns can give an upscale, intellectual vibe, especially when paired with a smart jacket and nice shoes.\n\nSimple, bright-colored plaids give a very rugged, blue-collar impression. For example, Paul Bunyan and other \"traditional\" lumberjacks are often depicted in bright red and black plaid shirts.\n\n, Plaid is the name of the pattern (not the material) so you can find plaid items in a variety of materials. In general, you'll want to find something that's just right for the weather outside \u2014 not too hot, not too cold. A few seasonal suggestions are below:\n\n\n\nSpring: Light cotton or flannel shirts, umbrellas, stockings, hats, shoes.\n\nSummer: Light cotton shirts (tied around waist when hot), skirts, shorts, jumpers, tees.\n\nAutumn: Heavier flannel shirts, rain boots, trench coats, hats.\n\nWinter: Heavy flannel shirts, jackets, boots, scarves.\n\n, Not all plaids are created equal. Though all plaids use the famous crisscross pattern, a huge variety of colors, styles, and sizes are available. A few pattern suggestions are listed below:Tartan: Large, old-fashioned looking pattern. Usually dark green background with navy blue, yellow, and red crisscrosses. Good for scarves, blankets.\n\nTattersall: Small, tight, square patterns. Thin lines of color on a neutral background. Looks very clean and modern. Works well for semi-casual dress shirts.\n\nMadras: Wide, colorful striped pattern. Usually incorporates bright, \"flowery\" colors. Good for flowing garments like dresses or loose flannel shirts.\n\nGingham: Two-color \"checkerboard\" pattern. Thick, regular stripes. Works well for a retro, folksy look.\n\n, Your outfit is more than your top and bottom garments. Wearing plaid accessories is a great way to give a burst of color to outfits that are dying to look a little more vibrant. However, remember that it's not a good idea to wear more than one piece of plaid at once unless the pieces match exactly.\n\n\n\nPossible plaid accessories include: hats, scarves, stockings, socks, purses, backpacks, shades, neckties, bowties, handkerchiefs, and much more.\n\n, Women's flannel shirts can offer a wide range of fashion possibilities depending on how they fit and how you wear them. Pick the style that gives the impression you want to broadcast to the world! See below:Loose plaid shirts tend to appear more \"rugged\" and casual. Try pairing one with a band T-shirt or an old tank top for a grungy sense of style. You can even wear men's shirts and let the tails hang below the waist for a \"boyfriend\" look.\n\nFitted plaid shirts and blouses tend to appear more \"put-together\" and professional. These are great for a semi-casual look at the home or the office.\n\n, Love your plaid shirt but can't figure out how to work it into your outfit? There's no rule that says you have to wear it as a shirt. Try tying it around your waist as a sash or belt to add a line of bright color to your outfit that attracts attention to your waist.\n\n\nAs an alternative, you can tie your shirt in a loop and wear it diagonally across your chest or tie the sleeves around your neck like a sweater.\n\n, This easy look is fantastic as an \"anywhere\" outfit. Pair it with a set of a clean (yet casual) shoes like flats for a touch of refinement or try sneakers for spunky style.\n\n\nYou may want to keep jewelry and flashy accessories to a minimum with this outfit. These sorts of additions can clash with the casual aims of the rest of your clothes.\n\n, It's also easy to use plaid to give the opposite impression. Try wearing a fitted plaid tunic or dress over a pair of dark leggings. Then, wrap a scarf or belt around your waist and add a few gold accessories, such as necklaces, bracelets, or earrings, for a touch of class. Finish it off with a pair of fashionable heeled boots. You'll have red carpet style on a fraction of the budget.\n\n, No one's too old for this playful yet traditional outfit. Start by picking a plaid skirt with muted colors like navy glue, forest, green, or a neutral color. Then, pair it with a plain white button-down shirt for simple elegance. Wear a pair of black knee-high socks and throw on some simple black flats to complete the look.\n\n, Women have tons of awesome options when it comes to plaid accessories. Look for a plaid handbag, scarf, or belt at your favorite outlet. Then, for maximum impact, add the accessory to a simple plaid-free outfit that only uses solid prints like to a white t-shirt and jeans. The contrast between the accessory and the rest of your clothes will naturally make it an eye-catcher.\n\n\nSome famous labels, like Burberry, offer iconic plaid patterns on their accessories. These are great, but you don't have to spend lots of money to get this look. The visual contrast is what's important, not the price tag.\n\n, When it comes to plaid fashion for men, the idea of \"ruggedness\" is a popular one. To get this rugged, masculine look, pick a long-sleeved flannel shirt in traditional colors, like red and black or gray and black. Wear it with your most comfortable jeans and a pair of hiking boots. That's all you need!\n\n\nWhite or black tees are the perfect undershirts for this no-frills outfit. You can even try showing off a hairy chest by wearing a tank top \u2014 if you're going for the lumberjack look, you might as well flaunt it!\n\n, Brighter plaids aren't just for women. Bright plaid flannels go good with a tee shirt and jeans or shorts for a casual beach-bum look. Alternatively, pair a bright plaid dress shirt with a pair of khakis or grey dress pants for a bold, semi-formal outfit.\n\n, Depending on their fit, a pair of plaid shorts can have a wide range of effects. Try picking either a baggy or fitted pair of shorts depending on the situation. See below:\n\n\n\nBaggy plaid shorts usually give a more casual, relaxed impression. Pair with a fitted tee or a solid dress shirt for best results.\n\nFitted plaid shorts usually give a slightly classier impression. They're still more casual than pants, but they're more connected to \"upper-crust\" sports activities like golf. Try pairing with a solid-color polo.\n\n, Sometimes a small amount of tie in the right place can make a big impression. If you only want a subtle hint of plaid in your outfit, put on a plaid print tie the next time you wear a suit. The pattern will liven up your style without looking too tacky or overdone. Both neck ties and bow ties work well. However, plaid ties aren't usually appropriate for especially formal events.\n\n\nBe sure to use a subdued, solid-color shirt under the tie. Patterned shirts can make your upper body look very \"busy\" when paired with a complicated plaid tie.\n\n, Using plaid patterns for suits is do-able, but only if the plaid pattern is a subtle one. Suits that are bold about their plaid patterns are a relic of the 1970s. They can be visually distracting at best and can make you look like a game show host at worst. Pick plaid suits with very thin, subtle stitching and neutral colors to play things safe.\n\n\nAs a general rule, if a plaid suit looks like a solid color suit until you get close to it, it's probably safe.\n\n, This is worth repeating. One of the very worst things you can do with plaid is to wear lots of it. The best plaid outfits generally have one prominent plaid item. Outfits that do use multiple plaid items generally have them matching exactly and use neutral tones to keep the plaid from overwhelming the outfit, but even this is a difficult feat to pull off.\n\n\nPairing two different kinds of plaid in the same outfit is almost always a bad idea. With the complex, interlocking patterns of the plaid and the many colors involved, it's almost impossible to get the two items to match. Even if you do, the effect can be overwhelming.\n\n, Though it isn't always outright informal, plaid isn't usually considered especially dignified. There are usually much better choices for dressing respectfully. Unless you've been given special dress code instructions, it's better to stick to a suit, tuxedo, dress, or gown for events like weddings, funerals, and so on.\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is this: if the event is something you feel like you need to wear a suit or dress for, don't wear plaid (even if it's part of your suit or dress).\n\n, For the same reason that it's a bad idea to wear multiple different kinds of plaid, you won't usually want to wear plaid along with bright colors (either prints or solid colors). For instance, pairing plaid with neon-colored fabric is sure to make your outfit an over-complicated eyesore. Remember: neutral tones are your friends when it comes to plaid.\n\n, One of the best things about plaid is that it's easy to get great-looking plaid prints for cheap at thrift stores. Plaid gets a somewhat appealing \"weathered\" look as it ages. This makes a plaid shirt that was once intended as semi-formal wear or work clothing, for instance, perfect for a \"grungy\" ensemble in a few decades' time. Save money on your next shopping trip by visiting a second hand store and digging around for these sorts of plaid bargains.\n\n, For reasons that are difficult to define, bold plaid pants often look bizarre and distracting even when a shirt of the same print would not. While haute couture fashion models may be able to pull off plaid pants, 99% of the world's population can't, so you'll probably want to steer clear.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":681}

{"text":" Although constipation and nausea tend to be the two greatest concerns, other side effects to be aware of include:\n\n\nDrowsiness and reduced focus and mental alertness\nRespiratory depression (a decreased drive to breathe due to the effect that opioids can have on the brain; this can be lead to death if the patient overdoses on his opioid medication)\nItchiness\nDecreased libido and difficulty with orgasm\nThe possibility of becoming addicted to the medication\n\n, Trying an antihistamine medication such as Benadryl can help to alleviate the itch, but it can have a sedating effect. You may also want to try cetirizine, which is usually used in for chronic itchiness and has less sedating effects. Speak to your doctor about this if itchiness is a problem for you.\n\n, Doctors tend not to use stimulant medications to combat opioid-induced drowsiness, except in palliative (end of life) situations. The general approach is to see if the drowsiness subsides as your body gets used to the opioid medication and, if not, to reduce the dose.\n\n\nNote that this is another reason that your doctor will start you on a low dose of opioid medication, and gradually increase the dose as needed. This gives your body time to slowly adapt to the medication, as many of the opioid side effects decrease with time as your body gets used to it.\nDoctors also start with a low dose of opioid in order to prevent respiratory depression. They will monitor you at a low dose and ensure that your breathing is not negatively affected before increasing the dose, in order to ensure that you are not at risk of respiratory complications.\n\n, There are many different opioid medications available, so switching to another one (and rotating which one you take) can help to decrease the side effects you are suffering from. Your doctor can also vary the route of administration of the medication, such as switching it from an oral pill to a transdermal skin patch; varying the route of administration can also help to diminish side effects.\n\n, Dose reduction or switching opioids may be enough to reduce the problem; if not, your doctor or a sex therapist may be able to help you in other ways to reclaim your sex life.\n\n, The greatest risk factors for developing a dependency on opioid drugs is having a personal history of addiction or a family history of addictive behaviors.\n\n\nSpeak to your doctor about the possibility of addiction or drug dependency if this is a concern for you.\nKnow that everyone develops \"tolerance\" to opioid medications, meaning that the effectiveness of the drug gradually reduces with time as your body gets used to it.\nHowever, developing tolerance with time is not the same as developing an addiction.\nAddiction is when your ability to regulate your own behavior with regards to obtaining higher doses of the drug gets out of control.\nDo not use opioids chronically. Use pain pills only for short periods to control pain or relieve discomfort and use them as directed by your doctor.\nIf you do become addicted to opioid pills, reach out to a loved one, friend, or doctor. This intervention may get you the help that you need to recover from using these powerful drugs.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":683}

{"text":" An easy place to start is with lighting. This can be easily achieved by simply changing out your normal light bulbs for coloured ones. Green and Red seem to be the colours that work the best, blue looks a bit washed out. Black or Purple bulbs are also great for spooky effects. You can buy any of these from many supermarkets. Place some of them in the main room and some in table lamps. You\u2019ll be amazed at the difference it creates.;\n, Let\u2019s face it nobody ever really imagines Halloween being set in modern times!\n\n, What\u2019s left can be transformed by throwing over a white sheet, dust covers like you observe in all the movies.\n\n, Check out this Refrigerator Door Cover. With this on your Bathroom Door your guests will never have to ask for directions.\n\n,,, then you can either get a can of spray glue and spray the objects followed by sprinkling the dust over (you can get this from your vacuum cleaner) or you can buy textured spray which if used heavily creates a sandstone like gritty finish but if used sparingly will look almost like dust.By selecting the vacuum cleaner option means that with a quick wash you can use all the dishes again. Anyway sprinkle the dust over the dining sets and the tablecloth.\n\n, Green Bottles look the best as the wax shows up better against the green glass. Make sure you let a good amount of wax flow down the bottles or holders, the wax looks really great and helps to set the scene in action.\n\n, I\u2019ll let you be the judge of horrors you think your children and guests can handle.\n\n,\n\n\nIts time to get one of dad\u2019s old suits and stuff it with straw or old clothes.\nMake a round head shape with a balloon or ball (anything will do to as long as its head shaped).\nYou could get a Halloween mask for the face and use a party wig or a hat for the head. You can make your guest as gruesome as you want.\nTear up the clothes make them look old and worn with a bit gray and bit of blood and slim doesn\u2019t go amiss.\nPop them on one of the chairs at your dining table and you have a zombie dining guest, create more and have a whole party of dining zombies.\n\n, Some of their food could be a real eye opener too, but that\u2019s for later...\n\n, We did this for my 8 years old Halloween Party and the effect was great, the kids and parents loved it!\n\n\nMake a couple of templates in different sizes ranging from small to large. The easiest way is to fold a piece of paper in half and draw out half a bat and then when you\u2019re happy with the opened shape use this as a template to create the rest using black paper. Then simply place on the walls and ceilings using blue tack.

This circle will be used as the top of your helmet so make sure it is a perfect circle. If possible, use a pencil and protractor or stencil. Label this part \u201cB.\u201d\nCut an opening in the front of the same jug. Hold the milk jug by the handle and hold it so that you're looking at the front of the milk jug. The opening you cut is meant to accommodate the other milk jug; therefore, cut a rather large \u201cC\u201d shape into the front of the jug. Label this part \u201cA.\u201d\n\n,\n\n\nCut the top third of the second jug and put the remainder of the jug aside.\nSlice the opening off the second jug by creating a round circle on the top. Because the circle you cut from the first milk jug should fit on top, use that as a guide. Discard the remainder.\nCut the top in half so that you're left with the front portion of the milk jug without a back. Label this part \u201cC.\u201d\n\n, Turn on the hot glue gun and set at either low or medium. Be careful\u2013\u2013if the glue is too hot, it may melt the plastic.\n\n\nGlue part \u201cC\u201d on top of part \u201cA.\u201d This will serve as the lower and front sides of the helmet. The top of the jug is the helmet \u201cnose.\u201d The top opening on the top of the part \u201cC\u201d should be on top where you will be able to affix part \u201cB.\u201d\nGlue part \u201cB\u201d into part \u201cC.\u201d Part \u201cB\u201d should fit snugly into the top of part \u201cC.\u201d Hold this piece together until the glue dries.\nGlue a milk cap on either side of the milk jug opening. Flip the cap upside down and affix the top of the cap to the mask. Make sure the caps are evenly distributed on either side of the jug hole.\n\n, At this point you should have a helmet that you could place on your head. Now you can begin to add details so it resembles a real Storm Trooper helmet:\n\n\nCreate eye-holes in the front. It\u2019s important that you see while wearing this mask so put the mask on and have someone draw dots where your eye-holes should be. Make the eye-holes as small as possible since \u201ceyes\u201d were not overly apparent in the real Storm Trooper mask.\nPunch holes on either side of the back of the mask and thread the piece of elastic string through the holes. The elastic will hold your mask in place. Tie a knot on the outside end of the elastic to hold it in place. If you need to adjust the length, do so while threading the string.\nSpray paint your helmet completely white. Place the helmet on top of several newspapers, preferably in an outdoor area and spray the entire mask completely white. Allow the mask to dry for several hours or overnight.\nAdd details using the electrical tape and black, white and grey craft paint. This is when the totally white mask transforms into a scary Storm Trooper helmet. Print out a photo of the real thing and follow the details based on the film helmet. Use the black electrical tape to form a band around the forehead area and cut a circle from the tape to seal the milk jug opening. Use the black Sharpie for adding in the more intricate details.\n\n, These are listed under \"Things You'll Need\".;\n, Cut a circle out of the bottom of the jug, cut the handle of the jug as well. This jug will provide the \u201cskeleton\u201d of your helmet, so try to determine the size using your own head as the model (or the intended Storm Trooper\u2019s) to ensure a decent fit.\n\n, Leave about 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) plastic, this will be use to connect to the second jug to form the half of the helmet.\n\n, The most important about what you're cutting with is that it does the job, the brand doesn't matter at all.\n\n,,,, You can see the Storm Trooper\u2019s helmet already taking shape.\n\n,,,, Make sure you paint them black. If you have some broken or old or very cheap sunglasses hanging around your house you can disassemble it and glue them in the eyes, this would really add realism to your helmet.\n\n, Add an old washing machine hose to act as a breathing apparatus use on board flying TIE Fighters.

Spread your fingers and press your palms into the floor evenly. You'll be only a few inches off the floor at this point, your spine still mostly straight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to keep your elbows close to your body, pointing behind you instead of out to the sides.\n\n,, You want to engage your abs to protect your lower back.

Your palms and soles of your feet should be planted firmly on the ground, your butt in the air, so that you from a triangle with the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep your toes and fingers splayed and comfortable. You should be able to wiggle all twenty digits.\nYou arms and legs should all be straight, with only a slight bend in the knees and elbows.\n\n, If cobra pose is challenging for you, take it slow and bend your back very gently. It is perfectly fine to stay in a very low cobra pose instead of advancing to a high cobra. You should never force your back to bend if it is not comfortable, as this can lead to serious injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you feel discomfort in your back when your palms are on the floor, try resting your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders for sphinx pose.\nYou can also perform cobra pose standing up by placing your hands against a wall and pushing them down, just as you would push against the floor in a traditional cobra. Open your chest and arch your back by drawing your shoulder blades towards each other and tilting your head slightly back. This is a great variation to choose if you are pregnant.\n\n, If cobra pose is easy for you, you can continue to improve your strength, flexibility, and balance by adding new variations to the pose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo challenge your balance while in cobra pose, bend your right knee and grab your ankle with your right hand for half frog pose. Hold for five breaths, relax, and repeat on the other side. Grab for your ankle with your opposite hand for an even greater challenge.\nIf you want to get a slightly deeper back bend in cobra pose, try placing yoga blocks under your hands.\nLift your hands a few inches off the floor in order to challenge your balance and further engage the muscles in your back., Only progress to a deeper back bend if cobra pose is easy for you and you are looking for something more challenging. Upward facing dog pose is similar to cobra pose, but offers a deeper back bend because the hips and upper legs are lifted off of the ground and more weight is placed in the hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people confuse cobra pose and upward facing dog. Remember, if you are doing cobra pose, your hips should be planted firmly on the ground and there should be minimal weight in your hands.\nThere are lots of other great choices for back bends too, including wheel pose, bridge pose, and camel pose, just to name a few. Choose the one that works best for you, or try incorporating all of them into your yoga practice.\n\n, Instead of practicing cobra pose in isolation, practice it as part of a sequence of poses. This is the way you will practice cobra pose in most yoga classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vinyasa flow typically involves a transition from upward facing dog or cobra pose to chaturanga, which is a yoga push up, and finally to downward facing dog. This sequence may be repeated multiple times in a row or at many different times throughout class.There are many different sun salutations, but most involve mountain pose and a standing forward bend, followed by a vinyasa flow. Warrior I, warrior II, and warrior III poses are common in sun salutations as well., You should avoid cobra pose if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist injuries, if you have recently had surgery, or if you have back problems that are irritated by bending.If you are pregnant, you should avoid lying on your stomach for this pose, but you can modify the pose by standing up with your hands against a wall and bending your spine the same way you would for the traditional version of the pose.\nIf you have never practiced yoga before, talk to your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough to begin a yoga practice and to discuss any modifications you should make to your practice.\n\n, Make sure you wear clothes that will allow you to move freely and will not distract you during your yoga practice.\n\n\nYou may want to have a small towel to place under your hands to prevent them from slipping on your mat if you begin to sweat.\n\n, If you are practicing outside of a yoga class, try to find a quiet space that is free from distractions for your yoga practice. You should have enough room to lay out your yoga mat and extend your arms in all directions without hitting anything.\n\n, You can take cobra pose to a few different levels, depending on the flexibility of your spine. No matter how flexible you are, start off with a gentle back bend to get your body warmed up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to stick to your own limits and try not to compare yourself to others in order to get the most out of your practice and avoid injury.\nIf you are taking a yoga class, your instructor will probably have you do a \"low cobra\" or \"baby cobra\" at the beginning, and will later allow you to work up to a \"high cobra\" pose if this works for you. This progression allows you to slowly warm up your spine.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":689}

{"text":" Notice the amount of time they dedicate to being with you, and the joy they express when spending family time with you. Imagine what it would be like to put yourself in their shoes. If you were your mom or your dad, how would you like to be treated by your own children? How would it feel to have to manage the many responsibilities they have in your household? What decisions would you make if you were in your parents\u2019 position? Thank them for the big things they do, like staying up all night with you when you\u2019re sick, as well as for the little things, like bringing you a cup of hot tea or helping you choose a dress for a special occasions.;\n, Although sometimes parents may seem overly-strict or embarrassingly old-fashioned, for example; Insisting that you respect them as well as your other elders by referring to them as \"Sir\", or \"Madam\", you must respect the fact that often their guidance toward you reflects wisdom that has been passed down from their own parents and elders. This type of strict guidance is an essential part of their teachings to insure that your able to grow up to be a good, descent, productive and respectful adult.\n\n, But \"NEVER\" be afraid of discussing problems that you are having with your parents. You have to tell them if you have issues, they can't help you with things they aren't aware of. It's their job as a parent to help you through things.\n\n, Often, when they ask you to do things that seem ridiculous or totally unfair, it\u2019s because they want what\u2019s best for you, and they want to teach you a very important and valuable lesson, that... \"Sometimes in life things aren't always fair a big portion of the time\".\n\n, Avoid arguments with them even if sometimes they seem unfair. Remember that above all, it's your parents that should make the final decision for you and that it's inappropriate for you to try to have the last word. A mature approach on your part includes having a calm and respectful attitude at the end of the conversation and accept that as they are your parents, their will must be your way. In time this will earn their trust in you, and it will demonstrate to them that you are well on your way to becoming a competent well rounded individual who will soon be capable of making your own good decisions, and be responsible for your actions. Don't talk back to your parents because when they are strict they are only trying to teach you responsibility and they only want the best for you.\n\n, Your parents make a lot of sacrifices for you, so reward their efforts with gratitude, obedience and a positive respectful attitude. Remember that these ways that they are teaching you will be so very valuable to you when you grow older and become parents of your own children. You will be able to convey to your own kids the family values you were taught while growing up at home. Remember this, would you want your children behaving with you, the way you may be behaving at home now? Never forget to apologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too.\n\n, If you have younger siblings, help them with their homework and their chores, be a model of good behavior for them and try to encourage their obedience to you just as you are obedient to your parents. This will help build a strong and loving family structure for your whole family.\n\n, If at all possible, help them out. Earn some money of your own and save it to help pay for a portion of your clothing and entertainment.\n\n, Parents by nature need to know and feel that their children have a great love for them. Be affectionate and give them just as many hugs and kisses as they give you, and do it as often as you wish. There never need be a special occasion reserved for doing this. Love costs nothing, and you can and should want to give it freely. It's what all parents hope and wish for from their beloved children, and I promise you this, the warm feeling you get in your heart for such acts as these last a lifetime.\n\n,, Your parents can be the best friends you\u2019ll ever have. They have rich lives and their years of stories are invaluable treasures.\n\n, Even if you don't live near them. You\u2019ll be grateful for the time you spent with them when they're gone, and you\u2019ll regret the lost opportunity if you don\u2019t visit them.\n\n, Invite them to movies, family dinners and on family vacation.\n\n, If your parents are elderly and have a hard time driving or getting around, take them to see their friends, to go shopping, to restaurants and out for walks.\n\n, If you have children, let them visit your parents as often as possible. A loving relationship between grandparents and grandchildren is one of the joys of life (not to mention free babysitting!).\n\n, Just like you were when you were a kid!\n\n\nBe affectionate and give them hugs and kisses (they still love it!).\nApologize if you've argued with them; remember that they have feelings, too.\nThank them for helping to make you the wonderful person you've become.\nNow that you have income, spoil them the way they spoiled you. Bring them small gifts like flowers, chocolates or a book you think they might enjoy. Give them big gifts on their birthdays and important holidays.\nEveryday, take the opportunity to tell your parents you love them.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":691}

See your aircraft manual.\nWith a multiengine aircraft, you have to check, not only the required runway length, but the \"Start-Stop\" distance for your aircraft.\nStart-Stop distance is the distance required, for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to VMC, then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway. The distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310.\nSome pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft.\nSingle Engine Service Ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft., but, an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft.

Try using needle ball, it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw.\n\n,\n\nFirst verify the throttles are both on full power, both prop controls in full forward, and mixtures in full rich.\nSome pilots use the \"Dead Foot Dead Engine\" procedure. Meaning, if the left engine failed, you'll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight, if left foot isn't needed, then the left engine must be dead.\nSome say, \"That's simple, the prop will stop and the RPM will drop\".\nWell, in actuality, the prop continues to spin at the same RPM.\nA windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately.\n\n,\n\nNow that you've identified the dead engine, verify full power is applied to the good engine.\n\n,\n\nReduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into feather position. (Prop Control all the way back).\nFeathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag, and stop the prop from rotating.\nYou don't need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un-controllable.\n\n,\n\nGet the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude.\nTry to maintain straight ahead flight. Raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions.\nAlways practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude.\nAlways hold the dead engine wing high until landing (but, Only if you really have a dead engine).\n\n,\n\n\nADS-B, or (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), is a cornerstone of Next Generation air traffic modernization.\nMandated soon by the FAA for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a Mode C transponder must be equipped with ADS-B.\nThis new system, when properly installed and operated, will allow the pilot to see, and be seen, and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity.\nIn addition to aircraft traffic, in flight services and weather information can also be sent to the pilot in flight.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":692}

{"text":" Sites like Tokyo Roomfinder and Japan Homefinder are there to give you insight into what is available in the area you want to stay in.\n\n\nThere are foreigner-friendly rental agencies specifically to help people new to Japan find accommodations. Foreigners typically find difficulty finding housing in the traditional housing market.Apartment finders and real estate sites will have plenty of listings of potential places you should look into.;\n, Here are some key terms to know:\n\n\n1K is a one room apartment with a kitchen.\n1DK is a one room apartment with dining room and kitchen.\n2LDK is a two room apartment with a living room, dining room and kitchen.\n\n, There are real-estate services that will have the connections to set you on the right course. If you're not yet fluent in speaking Japanese, it helps to bring a Japanese friend along with you to interpret what's being said.Only apartments that are currently vacant will be viewable by new prospective tentants.Real estates tend to focus their efforts on specific neighbourhoods. Because of this, you should figure out what neighbourhood you would prefer to live in before linking up with an agent.\nAble is a well-known real estate service., Even if there's a specific area you're planning on living in, you should still have a fair degree of options available to you. Because Japan's urban layout is so dense, you may find multiple potential places that are all within walking distance of one another.\n\n\nApartment rates will vary wildly depending on the closeness to a city centre you're renting in. In a city centre, rates will vary from 100000-200000 \u00a5 per month. Outside of a city centre, rates tend to vary from 50000-150000 \u00a5 per month, depending on the size and amount of rooms in the apartment. This roughly equals to 1000-2000 USD and 500-1000 USD respectively.\nIf you're budget savvy, you may try getting a room at a jiko bukken. These properties are seen as tainted because a tenant died there from unnatural causes. Because a potentially \"haunted\" house is more difficult to sell, you may get a deal on it., Companies such as Leopalace21 and UR acknowledge the difficulties of finding lodging in Japan, and offer short-term accommodations that can be renewed on a weekly basis.\n\n\nLeopalace21 hires staff with experience in English, making it a perfect choice for people coming from abroad., Here are the important documents you will need:\n\n\nA copy of your passport (if you're a foreigner.)\nA copy of your residence card.\nRecent pay slips or bank statement, to prove that you have the money to pay.A domestic emergency contact, to call in case there's a problem and someone needs to get involved. This should be a Japanese person that can otherwise vouch for you.\nVerification of employment. Many agencies will only hire you if you can prove that you will make at least 300% of what your rent will cost.A character reference. As in Western cultures, a character reference is a quick letter from someone indicating that they're dependable. This will give the landlord some bonus assurance that you're reliable when it comes to keeping the apartment responsibly.\n\n, A guarantor is required in order to sign any tenancy agreement. This refers to an individual that will vouch for you and pay up the slack for you if you fail to meet the terms of the agreement. A guarantor needs to be a Japanese national. If you cannot find a guarantor of your own, there are agencies that will act as guarantor for you for a nominal fee., If you're looking for a place, you may need as much as six months rent just to get started with a place. Here are some of the fees you should look out for:\n\n\nA real estate agent's fee called \u201cChukai Tesuryo\". This is non-refundable and is typically one month\u2019s rent.\nA security deposit called shikikin. This is typically two or three months' rent.You are also expected to provide a gift to the landlord. This is referred to as a reikin. Unlike the security deposit, this is non-refundable. It is typically between 1-2 months rent.\nA reservation fee called tetsukeikin. It\u2019s refunded as soon as you sign contracts. This is the agency's way of making sure you\u2019re serious about the deal.\n\n, Above all, the Japanese respect politeness, punctuality and civility. You should take great lengths to coming across as a consummate professional when you meet a landlord to discuss contract agreements. This includes being to the meeting on time (or early, if possible), and dressing as you would to a job interview.\n\n\nSome landlords won't rent to foreigners or non-Japanese races based on the perceived friction it may create. If you're new to the country, this may make it more difficult for you.Unfortunately, discrimination cases don't usually go through in Japan currently. However, you should still file a complaint nonetheless if you feel you're being discriminated against based on your race.If you are having trouble finding a landlord who will take foreigners, you may want to go through a foreigner-friendly real estate agent.\n\n, Once you have found a place you want and the landlord has accepted you, it's time to sign a contact. Take extra time to read through the contact, and get a Japanese friend to interpret the writing for you if you aren't yet fluent.\n\n\nMake sure to have all of the money needed to pay your fees in advance of signing the agreement.\n\n, Above all, Japanese apartments tend to be much smaller than their Western equivalents. The walls are thinner. This makes it so that sound carries between apartments easier. In addition, most older Japanese buildings do not have Western toilets. Instead, they have \"squatter\" toilets. If you're new to living in Japan, this may take some getting used to.\n\n, Much like the West, outlets like IKEA and even Craigslist are perfect for finding furniture at a relative discount. In addition, because there are many foreigners staying in Japan for a fixed amount of time, some rental agencies will rent you the furniture for a given amount of time. This way, you won't have to buy the furniture new.\n\n, Regulations and discipline are highly regarded in Japanese culture. Each apartment contract should have its regulations listed. Talk to your landlord if you're unsure.\n\n, Japanese society values its peace and quiet. There is an understanding that you won't play music or be loud during the day or night. If you need to let loose, you may do so in a public area. Residences should be seen as places of rest rather than recreation.\n\n, Above all, a successful stay in a Japanese apartment will be defined by how well you get along with fellow tenants in the building. Go out of your way to treat others with respect, and do what you can to accommodate them. Chances are the other tenants will offer you the same respect in turn.\n\n\nIf you are a Westerner planning on coming to Japan to stay, be aware of some of the negative stereotypes the Japanese people may have. Some Japanese see foreigners as unnecessarily crude and loud. If you show them how polite you can be, you'll force them to rethink this position.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":699}

However, some people enjoy the extra space of a larger tub.;\n, You will probably need an electrical permit. In some areas, a special wall access to the motor and pump is required.\n\n,,, Reuse your P trap if it is plastic and in good condition. Replace your P trap if it is metal or in bad shape.\n\n,\n\n\nCover the floor with a drop cloth. Use a plumb line and level to mark the area of old tile that needs to be removed. Make sure that the new tile will cover the joint from the drywall you are about to remove.\nUse a utility knife to cut through the drywall. If you use a saw, you are more likely to hit wiring or plumbing. Use a pry bar to pull out the tile in large sections or piece by piece. If necessary, you can use a hammer to make a hole in the tile to get you started at the top. Wear safety glasses while you are removing the tile.\nCheck the wall insulation. If it is dry and not moldy, you can reuse it. Otherwise it will have to be replaced. Cover moldy areas of the wall with a formula to preserve wood once they are dry before replacing the insulation.\n\n,\n\n\nOld tub removal can take place in a few ways. You can take it out whole or break it into pieces to remove it. Fiberglass or steel tubs can be broken into pieces with a reciprocating saw. Cast iron tubs can be broken with a sledgehammer. If you decide to break the tub, you should wear safety glasses. You may also want to wear earplugs.\n\n,\n\n\nDraw in your center lines. Make sure they are appropriate for the layout you have planned for your tile.\nInstall a 2 by 4 inch (5 by 10 cm) backing for your faucet using the dimensions recommended in the instructions. If necessary, install tub spout and shower head backers.\nAssemble the copper pipes and solder them together. If you are soldering onto the valve, be certain to take off the cartridge beforehand. Also, you should wait to solder the tub spout until after you have put in the tub.\nCheck to make certain that the P trap will reach the new drain. If it needs to be extended, extend it at this time.\n\n,,,\n\n\nDifferent tubs are leveled in different ways, so it is important to follow the directions that came with your new whirlpool tub. In any case, the floor, not the rim of the tub, should support the tub's weight. Check the underlying structure if the floor is more than 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) out of level.

{"text":" You can also choose to purchase them online if you do not need them right away.;\n, It is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands.\n\n, If any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps, use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them.\n\n, It is important to remember to loosen, or break, the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle. This way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs.\n\n, Once the lugs have been loosened, it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed. As mentioned above, this should be done on level concrete or some other hard, level surface. Some important things to remember when jacking up the care are:\n\n\nYour owner\u2019s manual will recommend jacking points\nThe most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack.\nYou should use jack stands to stabilize the car.\nIf you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time.\n\n, At this point, the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand. If not, finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench. Once the lugs are removed, pull the wheel off of the wheelbase. Place wheels under the car as back-up protection in case the jack stands fail.\n\n, This cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub. This will expose the retaining nut., There will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening (referred to as a cotter pin). Remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver., Using a wrench or ratchet, turn the nut counter-clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. If the nut is stuck lubricate it with WD-40 or similar lubricant.\n\n, Some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub. If this is the case you will need to remove those bolts. , Pull the drum straight off of the hub. You may have to wiggle a little to get it started. If the drum appears stuck and will not pull off, you should:\n\n\nCheck to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed.\nCheck to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes., This step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes. You will need to look on the back side of the backing plate (the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted) for a small rubber plug. Removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster. Use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes.\n\n\nThe adjuster is designed to self-adjust the shoes into a tightened position, so loosening them may be tricky. If the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust, you are going in the wrong direction.\nOnce the drum is removed you can continue.\n\n, These springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe. Once the brake pedal is released, they return the brake shoe to its original position. To remove them use the round, notched part of the brake spring pliers. Place the round part on the anchor pin (the nob that the springs are hooked to) and turn it until the notch catches the spring, and then twist and pull to remove the spring., To do this, lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers, push in, and twist until the ring comes off., At this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate. There will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe, but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe.\n\n, One of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line. To remove it, pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe., Fasten the emergency brake cable to the replacement brake shoe on the same side your removed it. Pull up the cover again and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe (it will look the same as the one you removed it from). ., You will need to transfer the return spring (at the top of the shoe) and the small emergency brake spring (near the center of the shoe). If your vehicle has any other hardware on the brake shoe, transfer it to the new one as well. ., You want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes. For this reason, you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate. ., There will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe. Hook the spring into that slot.\n\n, Now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place. Once you get it lined up, hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring.\n\n, Put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe. Place the ring over the spring and press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place.\n\n, Now it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe. Again, you are going to start with the bottom spring.\n\n, You will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever.\n\n, Here you will use the flat end of your brake spring pliers to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe. This will connect the two brake shoes.\n\n, Follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring. Place the spring first, then push and twist the ring into place.\n\n, This screw changes the position of the adjusting spring, which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes. Since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones, you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that. Use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster.\n\n, Slide the drum back onto the hub. You will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag. If the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them (using the adjusting screw). If the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them (using the adjusting screw).\n\n, You may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub. If you do, they should be reinstalled now.\n\n, You want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place, and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening.\n\n, The dust cap should push right back into place. Make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly.\n\n, You should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands.\n\n, Do this slowly and carefully. You do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly.\n\n, Once the weight is back on the wheels, use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual.\n\n, You should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work.\n\n, Before you drive your car you want to be sure that your new brake shoes are working properly.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":702}

They may be able to help you with coping strategies to reduce your stress.\nYou may also want to consider activities such as yoga, meditation, or relaxing walks in nature to help calm your state of mind.\nIt may also help to share your emotions with close friends and family as you progress through your pregnancy. It can be a challenging nine months and it can help to know that you are not alone.\n\n, A normal blood pressure is below 140\/90 (where the top number represents the systolic reading and the bottom number represents the diastolic reading). If your blood pressure is elevated above that point, your doctor will likely advise that you be treated with blood pressure medications to reduce it.\n\n\nYou can check your blood pressure on your own at a local pharmacy or big box store should you have any reason to feel concerned.\nIf not, your doctor will perform regular blood pressure checks at each of your prenatal visits, to ensure that there are no problems.\n\n, Some blood pressure medications are safe during pregnancy, while other are not ideal for pregnant women.\n\n\nBlood pressure medications to avoid during pregnancy include any ACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, such as Ramipril and Captopril), any ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers such as Candesartan), and any renin inhibitors (such as aliskiren). These drugs may cause birth defects or disease in the fetus.\nBlood pressure medications that are recommended in pregnancy include Methyldopa and Labetalol. Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine are also used frequently.\n\n, The risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy often goes hand in hand with other symptoms, such as protein in your urine; therefore, if you demonstrate high blood pressure, your doctor will do a full evaluation of your health at this time.\n\n, It may require treatment with a blood pressure medication, as well as continued monitoring to ensure that no further problems develop (such as preeclampsia).\n\n, Preeclampsia is dangerous for you and your baby, and needs immediate medical treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to eclampsia, which is the onset of seizures. Potential signs of preeclampsia include:\n\n\nFatigue\nVision problems\nSevere headaches\nRapid weight gain due to swelling\nNausea and vomiting\nReduced urine\nAbdominal pain\nSee your doctor or go to the Emergency Room (if you cannot get a same-day appointment with your family doctor) if you notice the above signs or symptoms.\n\n, Possible complications that may result from high blood pressure during pregnancy that is left untreated include:\n\n\nA diminished nutrient supply to the placenta. With high blood pressure, less blood flow gets to the placenta which decreases the nutrient supply for your baby. This can lead to poor growth of the baby.\nPlacental abruption. Placental abruption is when the placenta detaches from the uterus wall as a result of the stress from untreated high blood pressure. This is an obstetrical emergency requiring immediate delivery of the baby.\nPremature delivery. Your baby may need to be delivered prematurely if their wellbeing (or your own personal health) is compromised as a result of blood pressure concerns.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":703}
{"text":" Everyone loves to sleep in in the mornings from time to time. If for whatever reason you're trying to make a day disappear faster, you can shave off some time from it by hitting the snooze button and sleeping in a bit. Sleeping is by and far the most effective way of making time speed up. If you're already in bed and want the morning to disappear, sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all., A shower is one of the most physically pleasant stages of your day. Most people try to get in an out of the shower in record time, but if you have some time to kill, taking things more slowly can be great. Let the water rush over you; appreciate the warmth and temporary peace.\n\n, Sitting down with a cup of coffee and enjoying yourself at the kitchen table sounds sort of like a cliche at a point where everyone seems to rush from place to place, but slowing down to enjoy yourself strangely makes time feel that much faster.\n\n, There is probably a regular time you like to leave to go to work, school, or wherever else you typically need to be. If this is the case, consider leaving ten or fifteen minutes earlier than usual. Your brain tends to chunk memories into chapters, and leaving early will streamline that particular stage of your day. Unless you're leaving early, you may actually enjoy the extra time you have to prepare at the start of your day., Do something you've been putting off, whether it's an unfinished project or responding to emails. Your goals are already laid out for you, and you'll feel less stressed after you attend to them.\n\n\nBeing busy is your greatest potential ally when it comes to speeding up time. With that in mind, you should be doing everything you can to immerse yourself in the tasks at hand.\nWork may not be fun per se, but keeping yourself focused will make the day go by faster.\n\n, New projects are always on the go, and the slowest periods of work are perfect to latch onto something new. New projects can actually be a lot of fun at first to organize. Look around yourself at work; there's got to be something that could be done to improve your work environment.\n\n\nTeaming up with someone can add a pleasant social aspect to the experience, if you're extroverted and enjoy interacting with co-workers.\nIf you can't start something on your own accord, ask your superior for something new to do. Being kept busy will make the hours fly past, and you'll also be thought of as a hard worker who shows initiative without being asked.\n\n, Listening to music will keep you at least slightly entertained while you work, saving you from total boredom while you work.\n\n, If work is painfully slow and you're having a really hard time making the time pass, going for frequent breaks will give you ample time to relax and let your perception of time regulate itself. Go have a coffee. Go to the bathroom and relieve yourself. While these activities are unproductive and relying on them too heavily will have the opposite effect you're looking for.\n\n\nFrequent breaks make a distraction from work, but when it comes to passing time, the biggest benefit will be the relaxation it brings you. Of course, this won't have such a great effect if you're worried about falling behind in work.\n\n, People willingly lose hours of their life checking up on the lives of others, and most of the time, they're not even trying to burn time. Social media is a great tool to speed up time while you're at work. You don't want to make an overly frequent habit of it however, as it may compromise your work situation.\n\n\nAs a rule, relying too heavily on distractions at work can make the day feel slower. Ultimately, the best way to get through work as seemingly fast as possible is to immerse yourself in tasks.\n\n, Naps are good ways to kill some time if you're bored and could use the shuteye. If you really have nothing better to do, sleep will give your body some precious time to heal itself and patch up. Going to sleep in the middle of the day may be harder than at night or if you're already in bed in the morning, but it is the fastest way you can go about speeding up time if your body will allow you.\n\n\nNot to mention, when you wake up, you may feel more motivated to be productive and let the day come to you as it will.\n\n, Getting lost in leisurely activities is a brilliant way to speed up time, as we're never really considering how long we've been doing something when we're having a lot of fun. Reading one of your favourite books will take your mind off the passage of time, possibly even to the point where you'll wish there had been more hours in the day to fit in more reading.\n\n\nThe choice of book is very important in this case. A boring or poorly written book will actually have the opposite effect you're looking for.\n\n, So-called 'binge watching' takes up an exorbitant amount of time, and shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad are all too eager to eat up whatever time you'll allot to them. If you have a spare day you want to see over quickly, put on a show and let yourself relax. If it's a show you really like, you'll probably lose track of how much time has really gone by.\n\n, If you've got expertise in something, you may be a candidate to write a wikiHow article! Writing a step-by-step guide on a subject you're fascinated by can be a lot of fun, and like any writing project, you'll find the time slips away like nothing once you get into the thick of planning and realizing your article.If you're not the writing type, you could find a how-to article on any random subject that interests you and learn a new skill. Learning is a great way to pass time, as your mind will become too occupied to worry about what time it is.\n\n, There's nothing like curling up to watch a movie at the end of an overly long day. Unless a movie is dreadfully boring or their bladders are tempting them elsewhere, people aren't usually thinking of the time while they're watching a movie. Instead, they're immersed in what's on the screen. Watching one of your favourite movies during or after dinner can be an incredibly rewarding experience.\n\n\nCurling up somewhere comfortable like a bed or sofa is a must in this case. If your body's relaxed, you'll have an easier time letting the time slip you by.\n\n, When you're learning something new, time seems to speed up. This is because the mind is too occupied with the fresh tasks to be as concerned with the passage of time. Your stomach will thank you for the new experience, and if you like the recipe enough, you can use it again on future occasions.\n\n\nOn the other hand, some studies have actually found that time speeds up when you're doing things that you're already very familiar with. This would include recipes. The bottom line is that you want to be engaging with something., Sleep is the best way to accelerate time. No one is keeping track of the passage of time when they're dozing away. Getting a head start on your sleep will give you a big boost for the coming day, which may be a good thing if your current day hasn't been great.\n\n, People who are looking to make their days go by faster typically fall into one of two categories. The first group wants time to go by in anticipation of some upcoming event. The second are merely bored and cannot decide on how to effectively use their time. If you're trying to speed up the day due to a legitimate stressor, it is understandable and possibly worth doing. If you're bored, you're probably wanting time to speed up only because you're not engaged by anything at the moment.\n\n\nIf you end up finding something that interests you (possibly even from the suggestions in this article!) you'll probably stop caring about wanting the day to speed up.\n\n, In contrast, if you're trying to do something you're very familiar with will have the opposite effect. Routine is your friend. Your mind will speed up time and run on autopilot if you're regaling yourself with the familiar.\n\n, Speeding up your perception of time can only be approached indirectly.It ultimately doesn't matter whether you're doing something new or familiar, or even who you're doing it with; the passage of time ultimately depends on how busy you are. If you are occupied with something, no matter how trivial it may seem, you won't be thinking of the time.\n\n, To combat this, just make sure you're relaxed and feeling relatively decent. This will make it easier to focus on activities as well.\n\n\nThis includes seeing to things like solving headaches or migraines. A migraine can make even an enjoyable experience feel like a test of endurance.\n\n, Ultimately, the way you can speed up the impression of time in your head is to ignore the passage of time. Looking at a clock will remind you exactly how much time has passed, making you more aware of it generally. If you are dead set on speeding up your day as much as possible, you should make a point of avoiding any clocks. Don't even think about how much time has passed.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":704}

{"text":" Some people have difficulty running first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, and others thrive on 5 am runs. Find the time of day that works best for your body and gradually add distance and speed.;\n, Make a playlist that has varied music that can help you know when to speed up and when to jog. Interval training that transitions between fast sprints and recovery jogs helps to build speed over time. Mix a few of your favorite techno or hard rock songs in with some hip hop or country and create a pump-up mix that will get your legs moving in no time.\n\n, If you've always listened to music while exercising, try ditching the iPod for awhile and see how that makes your body feel.\n\n\nSome people can increase their running distance by not being restricted by the length or tempo of their playlist.\nRunning without music allows you to focus on your breath and listen to the sound of your body working.\n\n, Put on a running outfit that makes you feel energized and swift. While some people actually enjoy the heavy feel of a sweatshirt that makes them sweat it out, others prefer lightweight shorts and sweat-reducing material. Wear the clothing that you feel most comfortable in.\n\n, Running shoes come in very specific fits that are tailored to the length and width of your foot and are made for specific types of running. You can injure your feet by wearing improper footwear, so make sure to get your feet fitted by a specialist.\n\n\nRoad running shoes should be worn on concrete and other hard, man-made surfaces.\nTrail running shoes should be worn for off-road running on dirt trails, sandy beaches, and rocky or muddy paths.\nKnow if you have a high-arch, a normal arch, or a flat foot. The arch of your foot will determine how your foot moves as you run.\nIf your foot hits the ground equally, choose a neutral shoe. If you over-pronate your foot by rolling inward too much, choose a shoe for stability or motion control. If you supinate your foot by rolling outward too much, choose a shoe with a lot of cushioning and flexibility., Slowly jog half of a mile before stretching. Doing so allows you to warm up your joints and muscles before you stretch them, thus preventing injury. Be sure to perform dynamic stretches that include motion such as:\n\n\nLeg lifts. Swing one leg out to the side as far as you can swing it, and then swing it back across your body in front of your standing leg, as far as possible. Repeat this stretch ten times on each leg.\nCheerleader Kicks. Keep your back and knees straight, and walking forward, lift your legs straight out in front in an exaggerated march, and flex your toes towards you.\nButt kicks. Perform an exaggerated running-in-place motion while standing to loosen up your knees, hamstrings, and quads.\nWalking lunges. Squat into a wide lunge with one foot dramatically out in front of the other, and continue to switch between legs as you slowly progress forward.\nShoulder stretches. Don't forget to stretch your torso and shoulders to prevent cramping during your run. You use your arms to propel you forward when you sprint, so you'll need to be loose and limber. Pull one arm straight across your chest and hug it in with the forearm of your other arm. Switch sides and stretch the other arm.\n\n, Use a stopwatch to log yourself for various mileages in order to track your progress.\n\n, Incorporate hills into your runs two to three times per week to push your boundaries and condition your body. Try following this example weekly routine:\n\n\n\nDay 1: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes.\n\nDay 2: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1\u20442 mile (0.8\u00a0km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance.\n\nDay 3: Rest.\n\nDay 4: Long 60-90 minute run. Run at a pace that is comfortable enough to keep going.\n\nDay 5: 10-20-10. Jog for 10 minutes, run briskly for 20 minutes (80% effort), and then jog for another 10 minutes.\n\nDay 6: Rest.\n\nDay 7: Sprint training. Head to a track and practice sprints. Jog 1\u20442 mile (0.8\u00a0km), then run another mile, sprinting the straightaways and jogging the turns. Start out with just the mile and a half, and gradually increase your distance.\n\n, Being patient with yourself is one of the most important aspects of building endurance. Avoid pushing yourself to run too far until you have become comfortable with a gradual distance increase. Basically, don't try to run six miles right off the bat. Start out with one mile, then build up to a mile and a half, then two miles, etc.\n\n, Don't try to sprint out a five-mile run, you'll exhaust (and maybe even injure) yourself. Start off with a light jog and gradually build up your speed as you run.\n\n, Your breath can have a huge impact on your ability to run long distances. Make sure you are breathing in and out of your nose, or in through your nose and out through your mouth, depending on your preference. A steady breath means a steady heart rate and a higher lung capacity.\n\n, You want to run with the same poise that you walk. Don't hunch or bend your back as you run, keep your spine as straight as possible.\n\n, Plantar flexion occurs when you push off the ground by flexing your ankle joint. Dorsiflexion is the process of pulling your knee up off of the ground at a 90-degree angle. This reloads your ankle for forward push-off.\n\n, The hip flexor and lower back must flex as you run to hold your back straight and support forward motion. Make sure you are cycling the legs forward, not recovering the legs behind your body.\n\n, As you run, alternate driving your elbows back and forward in an exaggerated motion. As your elbow drives back, your opposite knee should lift up. Your elbows should also be bent at about 90-degree angles.\n\n, The longer your stride, the more effective your forward motions will be. To create longer strides, use your legs to push rather than pull you forward. This means the bulk of the power when you run should come from whichever leg is behind during the push-off.\n\n, Once you have the basic technique down, you can begin to decrease the interval between each stride, meaning you will pick up the pace and run faster. Try not to compromise your stride length as you increase your speed.\n\n, To develop speed over long distances, first incorporate intervals of 30-second or one-minute sprints into your runs.\n\n, Make sure to drink the recommended 3 liters (0.8\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of fluid for men and 2.2 liters (0.6\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of fluid for women per day.For runs over an hour long, you will need to drink water during your run.\n\n\nDrink water up to two hours before a long run. During the run, sip water in small sips and frequently to avoid bloating or cramping.\nAfter a long run, drink 500mL of water immediately, and then continue to sip water throughout the day to replenish your water supply., You can get lean protein from fish, chicken, turkey, tofu, eggs, and beans, just to name a few.\n\n\nSalmon is one of the best sources of Omega-3 beneficial fats, which promote a healthy inflammation response. An increase in Omega-3's in your diet may also help reduce the symptoms of asthma.\nOne egg a day will give you 30% your daily value of Vitamin K, which promotes healthy bones. In addition, eggs contain all of the essential amino acids that aid in muscle recovery. After a long run, your body will thank you for replenishing your store of amino acids.\nAvoid a diet high in red meat or processed meat. Both are thought to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, heighten bad cholesterol levels, and contribute to clogged arteries and a higher risk of heart attack.\n\n, Nuts, especially almonds, are high in Vitamin E antioxidants and Omega-3 fatty acids that can help lower bad cholesterol levels in the body. Vitamin E also protects body tissue from potential damage from free radicals. Be aware that nuts are high in fat, so only consume the recommended serving size daily., Dark greens and berries are packed full of healthy antioxidants and greens are extremely rich in fiber, which promotes digestive regularity. Foods like sweet potatoes and carrots are rich in beta-carotene, a healthy antioxidant that promotes muscle recovery.\n\n, When purchasing cereal, bread, crackers, and other carbohydrate-based foods, choose the whole grain or whole wheat option. Whole grains contain fiber and phytonutrients that support healthy digestion.\n\n, Potassium decreases the likelihood that you will develop cramps while you run, helps keep you hydrated, and speeds up muscle recovery. Good sources of potassium include bananas, milk, yogurt, and potatoes., If you aren't getting enough Vitamin C from your diet, consider taking a Vitamin C supplement or multivitamin daily.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":706}
{"text":" To make it easier for him, hang something from the handle of the refrigerator door. A rope with a thick knot on the end works particularly well for this, but a towel will work too. Just make sure it is properly secured to the handle.\n\n\nIf you decide to use an old rope or towel (i.e., something you don't mind ruining), check the integrity of the threads. If strands come off or it rips with little effort, find something newer. The fibers and dust will distract your dog and may be harmful to his health.;\n, Hanging a towel or rope won't usually inspire your dog to start opening the door. If you are lucky, he will at least investigate the new door accessory. If you want to draw his attention to the towel or rope, point at it with your finger. When he pays the towel or rope any attention, click your and give him a reward.\n\n\nFirst, click and reward when he looks at the towel or rope. Second, make him touch the rope with their nose before clicking and rewarding. This is the first part of shaping your dog's behavior into the acceptable form.\n\n, Once he knows paying attention to the towel or rope is an avenue for rewards he will expect them. Now, you want to start training your dog to open the door on command. While standing near the refrigerator (i.e., close enough to point and touch the towel or rope), use a command such as \"Open the fridge\". Click and reward when he successfully bites the towel or rope.\n\n\nYour dog may not initially understand the new command. He has been getting rewards without it so far. First, click and reward when he touches the towel or rope. Second, stop clicking and rewarding for just touching the rope. He will get aggravated and naturally bite the rope. Any motion to bite the rope should get a click and reward (e.g., touching it with his teeth or licking it). Don't move on until he actually bites the rope or towel.\n\n, Stop providing clicks and rewards for simply biting the rope. Make him hold or pull on the rope next. Taper your clicks and rewards so that he must pull harder and harder to get rewarded.\n\n, Train your dog to pull harder and harder on the rope. Start holding off clicking and rewarding until he pulls so hard the door opens. Click and reward if the door even opens a little and closes again. Continue clicking and rewarding until he opens the door all the way.\n\n\nThis can be difficult if your dog is pulling in the wrong direction. If you notice this is happening, stand in your dog's way so that he will have to move in a direction that causes the door to open. Once he starts associating the door opening with a reward he will not need to be guided.\nContinue using the command throughout the process. When your dog opens the door all the way and it stays open, reward your dog excessively. Keep practicing this exercise until the dog will open the door on command. Eventually, he will become much more proficient at the task.\n\n, Glass bottles will work too, but cans will not shatter when dropped. Your dog will be carrying the can sideways. Some beers may provide you options with cans. If you have a smaller dog you may opt to choose a tall can that has a smaller diameter. However, your beer of choice may not be packaged in these bottle-shaped aluminum cans.\n\n, You want to get the beer cold for now. Your dog may not be accustomed to the temperature of the cold can. If you use a lukewarm to train with, your dog may become distracted by the coldness of the can when attempting to grab the beer from the refrigerator.\n\n, This training can take some time. There's no need to defrost your refrigerator and freezer during training. Use a cold beer placed on the floor during this exercise. You may want to stick with a carpeted floor at the beginning. If he immediately picks up a can and drops it, then the damage to the can will be minimal.\n\n, Click and reward when your dog looks at the can. Then click and reward when he investigates the can. Anything that gets him closer to biting or picking up the can. With luck, a can in the middle of the room will be very attention-getting. He may naturally investigate.\n\n, As your dog investigates the can, he may engage in a number of behaviors. Any behavior that is closer to biting and picking up the can should receive a click and a reward. He may first sniff. Then he may lick. Then he may try to bite the can to carry it to another spot for more comfortable licking.\n\n\nYour dog may start licking the can profusely. It is cold, and licking the can will provide a very novel experience for him. If he starts doing nothing but lick the can, stop rewarding him for licking the can.\nIf it takes a while to get your dog to bite the can, replace the can with a cold one from the refrigerator. This way he is biting and picking up a cold can instead of a lukewarm one.\nIf you have a \"pick it up\" command typically used with a ball, use that command to teach the dog to pick up the beer can.\n\n, Start using a command such as \"Bring me a beer\" to encourage the on-command behavior. If your dog does bite the can it may be for the purpose of carrying it off for himself. Be sure to have some favorite treats ready to give him when he picks up the can and brings it to you. If the cold can, in and of itself, is a treat to your dog, you will need to find a treat he likes a lot more. Reward him for picking up the can, and, later, for bringing the can to you and releasing it into your hand.\n\n\nIf you regularly play fetch with your dog, use the same command to get him to bring the can to you.\nThis is where carpet comes in handy. If he has trouble picking up the can or drops it when a reward is presented, the can will fall softly on the carpet.\nIf your dog is reluctant to release the can, consider bring the treat closer to his mouth. He will have to release the can to receive the treat.\nConsider having your dog pick up the can first, while the can is lying on its side, and second, while the can is standing up normally. Most likely the beers will be sitting upright in the refrigerator, so that's the orientation your dog needs to be accustomed to.\nIf your dog fetches your beer but drops it in front of you, do not reward him. Repeat the command and point to the beer in front of you. Reward him only when he puts the beer in your hand or you can expect a lot of shaken-up beers in the future.\n\n, Once you know he will pick up and bring you a cold can of beer on command its time to move to the real deal. Open the refrigerator door to reveal a low shelf of beers. Put your cans near the bottom where your dog can get to him.Leave enough space so that your dog can reach in with his snout and grab a beer.\n\n, The fact that the beer is in the refrigerator and not the floor will not be lost on your dog. This is a completely new scenario. Your goal is to activate the same behavior as before but within the new setting. Pointing will help focus your dog's attention, while giving the command will activate the instinct to perform the associated reward-seeking behavior.\n\n, Click and reward for anything resembling the original behavior. Your goal is to get him to grab the beer from the fridge, and bring it to you. Ignore the fact that he neither opened nor closed the door. You will work on the proper sequence of behaviors later.\n\n, Teaching your dog to close the refrigerator door works best when he already knows how to close a door. Primarily because you don't want to leave your refrigerator door open for an extended period of time. Choose a door that the dog can easily move behind when the door is opened.\n\n, This can be difficult because he is not doing anything specific. Try putting a treat between your fingers. Then put the treat in front of their face. Without releasing the treat, move your hand toward the spot you want your dog to be (i.e., behind the door). When your dog gets behind the door, release the treat.\n\n\nIf you already have a command for your dog to sit on a specific spot or on or near an item or blanket, use that to get your dog to move behind the door. Place the item he sits close to or on behind the door, and use the proper command.\n\n, Hold a treat above your dog's head. He will likely try to stand up to get it. Lift your hand higher to get him to stand up more. When he is standing up, click the clicker and give him the reward. If you can get him to stand up and remain balanced, then he is doing well. This is not required though. He just needs to be up high enough so he can push the door closed.\n\n, Once your dog is trying to get the treat in the air, move your hand closer and closer to the door. Don't touch the door yourself. Wait for your dog to touch the door. Click and reward as soon as your dog makes any contact with the door. When he looks at the door and hit it then look at you for the treat, that's when you know you are ready to move forward.\n\n\nThis may be difficult if he does not want to touch the door. Try positioning the treat at the very edge of the door so that he almost have to touch the door to get it. If he moves around the door to avoid touching the door, position yourself perpendicular to the edge of the door (i.e., as if you are the door frame) so your dog will have to touch either you or the door to get to the treat.\nThis is really where the clicker is helpful. He may have so much tunnel vision he doesn't notice he touched the door while getting the treat. The clicker should help clue him in that touching the door is what you want him to do.\n\n, Start giving him a specific command such as \"Close the door\". Gradually encourage him to push the door harder and harder. Let him get the door all the way to the door frame. Keep clicking and rewarding as he gets closer and closer to causing the door to close completely. Start clicking and rewarding only when he shuts the door.\n\n, Now it\u2019s time to move to the last subtask. Just as you taught your dog to close a door, you now need to teach him to close the refrigerator door. This time you will want to change the verbal command. Instead of \"close the door\", try \"close the fridge\". This way he knows exactly which door to close even if you are in another room.\n\n, Start with the original command to see if he will understand. If he does, click and reward him. Then move to the new command. If he does not understand, use the same technique you used to teach him to close a door to close the refrigerator door.\n\n, Continue clicking and rewarding when he touches, pushes, or closes the door. If he closes the door once, you are not yet finished. You want him to hear the command, look at the door, close it, and then look back at you for his treat. Re-open the door each time he closes it and repeat.\n\n, First have him obey the command while you stand in front of the refrigerator. Then move farther away so he has to walk to the refrigerator to obey the command. Keep moving farther from the refrigerator until you are in a different room and out of eyesight of the refrigerator.\n\n, This time you want to do the same thing with the second command. Open the refrigerator. While standing in front of the refrigerator, give the \"Bring me a beer\" command. Click and reward when he completes the task. Then repeat the task as you move farther and farther and into a different room.\n\n, This last one is important. Although your dog may be able to put together that he has to open the refrigerator to get a beer, he will likely not remember to then go back and close the refrigerator. Practice having him complete this task just as you did with the previous tasks. Just don't forget to re-open the refrigerator each time he closes it.\n\n, While standing near the refrigerator, give your dog each command in sequence. First \"Open the fridge\", then \"Bring me a beer\", then \"Close the fridge\". At first, reward him for each task completed. Then start rewarding him only when he finishes the last task. Keep giving the commands as you move into a different room.\n\n, The final task is to train your dog to complete the \"Bring me a beer\" task without needing to provide the \"Open the fridge\" command. Stand in front of the refrigerator and give the \"Bring me a beer\" command. If you are lucky, he will almost immediately pulls the refrigerator open to get to the beers. If not, don't use the \"Open the fridge\" command. Instead, keep using the \"Bring me a beer\" command but train him to open the door first just as if the pulling the rope was the first part of the \"Bring me a beer\" command.\n\n\nTraining your dog to close the refrigerator in the middle of the second task may be very confusing for your dog. If you insist that this is necessary, you will want to start training your dog to first pick up a beer, then close a door, and then bring the beer to you. You may find it is easier to give the \"Bring me a beer\" command and follow with a \"Now close the fridge\".\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":707}
{"text":" The goal here is to remove any foreign particles in the pores of the substrate and also to remove any loose concrete.\n, It is important to use a plastic sprayer as the muriatic acid will corrode metal sprayers., You should hear a light fizzle after you have applied it., The acid then ammonia wash will neutralize the ph of the concrete and also open the capillaries of the surface.,,,, Be sure to remove any puddles before apply base coat.

{"text":" Consider the type of content you want to share with the world, then choose a name that embodies that theme. Having an Instagram name that reflects your personality is a great way to attract followers who share your interests.\n\n\nIf you are having problems picking an Instagram name, try the name generator at spinxo.com\/instagram-names.\nDon't be afraid to use underscores (_) or other symbols. They will often improve an Instagram name by making it easier to read. However, try to keep the symbols to 1 or 2, so someone can search for you by name.;\n, If possible, make it a creative photo of yourself (instead of an object) so that people can put your face to the name. If you want to be famous, you should not mind putting a few personal things on Instagram.\n\n, Consider a hobby, fascination, or desired aesthetic, and aim to keep your Instagram content within that theme. Add engaging information about your theme to your Profile page, and be sure to post relevant captions when uploading new photos and videos.\n\n\nAre you a foodie? Then focus on food-related photos.\nAre you a fashion junkie? Focus on colors, styles, and trends.\nDo you like a certain game or book series? Take creative photos of it and post it on Instagram!\nAre you into a celebrity at the moment? Make your Instagram profile all about that person! You can also find other fans of that celebrity and make a community of your own.\nDo you love role playing? Instagram is a great place to do so. Role play as your favorite character and join other role play communities as well! For example, if you love Naruto, you can roleplay as him or other Naruto characters!\n\n, What can you share with the world that nobody else is doing? Keeping your Instagram account unique ensures that your followers stick around---they won\u2019t be able to find your content anywhere else!\n\n, Become a pro by taking different types of photos and using the filters. Notice the different ways filters can enhance dim lighting or increase the depth of certain colors. You may need to preview your photo in all of the available filters before finding the right one.\n\n\nHaving uniform colors and effects on most of your photos is a great way to develop an aesthetic. Using too many different filters could make your profile look tacky. See the hashtag \u201c#nofilter\u201d for examples.\nSome Instagram users choose never to use filters as a way to highlight the natural beauty of their photos.\n\n, Instagram\u2019s built-in filters are cool but somewhat limited. There are additional apps that can add even more depth to your content. Install a well-reviewed photo editor from the app store and breathe new life into your feed.Try Instagram\u2019s Boomerang to make short, engaging stop-motion videos.\nAlso try Layout, which allows you to combine multiple photos in a single collage-style image.\nTry VSCO Cam, Prisma, Aviary, or Snapseed for high-quality photo editing.\n\n, You won\u2019t always get a great shot the first time, so take several photos and choose the best one. Only post the best, most creative photos that will keep your followers interested and engaged.\n\n\nAs with traditional photography, Instagram photography has an element of \"practice makes perfect.\" You can only improve by using the app regularly and trying new things.\n\n, Experiment and get creative with your photos. Try new angles, color combinations, and subjects in a variety of interesting settings.\n\n, Use your Instagram account to create a story that is creative, original, and honest. Add \u201ccliffhangers\u201d to your photos to keep fans coming back for more.\n\n\nFor example, document your travels to a new place, the countdown to a significant event, or your journey with a new pet.\n\n, Spend more time making an individual photo exceptional instead of sharing several that are mediocre.\n\n, Captions can be humorous or sincere. Be playful, but informative.\n\n, Inspired by Snapchat, Instagram now allows users to post photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours. Stories will not be stored in your Instagram feed, so use this feature to share all of the things that don\u2019t quite fit with the rest of your account. Your stories will appear at the top of your followers\u2019 feeds., Pay attention to what is trending and use hashtags on all of your photos. Many Instagram users search for hashtags to find new users to follow\u2014using the right hashtags ensures that people who are looking for your sort of content are able to find you.For example, someone who posts photos from hiking adventures in the Pacific Northwest may use tags like #hiking, #method, #exploregon, #camping, and #mtranier.\nSomeone who shares their illustrations may use the hashtags #illustrators, #artistsofinstagram, #penandink, and #womanartists.\nSome popular hashtags are #nofilter (unfiltered photos), #flawless (when you\u2019re looking your best), #nochill (when life gets crazy), and #tbt (Throwback Thursday, a day when Instagrammers post old photos).\n\n, Find Instagram users whose photos you enjoy and add them to your Follow list. Try to comment and like photos every time you go onto Instagram. It is very hard to become popular on Instagram without interacting with and trading likes with others.\n\n, You most likely have a set number of friends who would be willing to follow you. Follow your Facebook friends on Instagram and they will surely follow back., When posting a new photo, tap your preferred social media option under \u201cShare\u201d and enter your username and password. This will post your Instagram photo, giving your followers on other platforms the chance to follow you on Instagram.\n\n, While sharing some Instagram photos on Facebook or your blog can attract new followers, keep some content exclusive to Instagram. Remind your Facebook or blog followers that they should follow your Instagram for different photos. Let your Instagram account be where people can get to know another side of you.\n\n, If you post something funny, caption it with something like, \u201cTag three friends who would think this is funny.\u201d When people tag their friends on your photos, their friends will view your photo and usually like it or start following you.\n\n, Geotagging adds a location link to the top of your Instagram photos, allowing people to see where you were and view other photos taken at that location. This is an excellent way to attract new followers, but remember that geotags share your location with the entire world. Avoid geotagging when you are home or anywhere else that you don\u2019t want to be found in person.\n\n, According to the analytics firm Union Metrics, brands that decrease the frequency of their posts tend to lose followers quickly.Your followers followed you because they want to see your content. Be consistent with posting, but don\u2019t overdo it.\n\n\nIf you post more than 2-3 photos or videos per day, use Instagram Stories so you don\u2019t clutter your followers\u2019 feeds.\n\n, When posting photos, add a caption that contains a question for your followers. Make the question something thoughtful, or something funny. The more people that answer your question, the more popular your post will be.\n\n, To respond to them directly, type the \u201c@\u201d symbol and type their Instagram name. This shows everyone that you\u2019re down to earth and willing to interact with your fans.\n\n, According to an Instagram study, posts that mentioned another Instagram account (e.g., @instagram) in the caption encouraged 56% more comments and likes than otherwise.For example, if you take a photo at a restaurant, mention the restaurant\u2019s Instagram name (e.g., @olivegarden) in the caption.\nIf you see something that reminds you of another Instagram user, snap a photo and post it with a caption like, \u201cI thought of you, @!\u201d\n\n, Unless you are already a celebrity, you need to put time and energy into becoming an Instagram sensation. Increase your responses to comments, respond to Direct Messages, and like tons of photos!\n\n, If you have a creative idea and some fans, grow your community by giving away a prize in exchange for likes and follows. Choose a prize worth winning, share a photo of it on Instagram, and then encourage your followers to like the photo to enter. When the contest ends, choose a random follower to win the prize!\n\n\nEncourage your followers to tag their friends so they can also enter your contest.\n\n, Websites like Statigram, Websta.me, and Iconosquare provide statistics that help you track your Instagram success. If you find that you lost several followers over a particular period, look back at your feed and see what may have sent them running. If your views spiked when you shared a certain photo, share more like it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":709}

{"text":" You can wear pretty much anything, but vintage and skate-brand shirts are the most popular among skaters. You can wear a faded t-shirt, a fitted shirt, or even a tank top. Consider wearing a fitted top if you are wearing baggy pants.\n\n\nConsider going vintage. This doesn't mean that you have to wear clothes that are ripped or torn. Instead, try going to a second-hand store and picking up some vintage t-shirts from the 80s and 90s.They don't even have to be skateboard-related. Many skaters also like to wear vintage cartoon shirts as well.;\n, Even if you are posing as one, you may want to look as though you actually skateboard. Skateboarding requires a lot of leg moment, so you'll want something that is easy to move in. Here are some popular options for you:Baggy leans are the most popular choice amongst skaters.\nLoose-fitting cargos are another popular choice. They are tomboyish, and the extra pockets are great for storing things, such as music players.\nCapris are another popular choice, especially if they are loose fitting and baggy. Think guy shorts.\nAvoid wearing anything that is too ripped or torn looking. It will just look messy.\n\n, Skater girls will wear what is easiest for them to skate in. You might find that baggy clothes aren't all that comfortable, and that skinny jeans are the easiest for you to move around in.Shorts are popular, especially in the summer. Many skater girls find high-waist shorts to be very comfortable. If you are learning how to skate, however, you might want to wear some kneepads in case you fall.\nLeggings are easy to move in, but they tear easily too. If you are just learning how to skate, you might want to hold off on the leggings to avoid ruining a nice pair.\nSkirts may look cute, but they are not always practical either. If you choose to wear a skirt, you might want to wear some leggings or biker shorts underneath them to prevent any embarrassing incidents.\nSkinny jeans can look great, but they can be difficult to move around in. If you want to wear skinny jeans, make sure that you can bend down and touch your board easily. If your jeans are too tight, you might not be able to perform any tricks., You can sneakers that have a flat bottom and a good grip. Canvas shoes (high-tops are especially popular) are also a great choice, but keep in mind that they wear out quickly. Most skater girls will pass on the ballet flats and heels because its difficult (and sometimes dangerous) to skate while wearing them.Try changing out the laces in your shoes for bright-colored ones. This is a great way to show off your personality.\nIf you have canvas shoes, try drawings some cool designs on them using a fabric marker. You can also doodle on the toe area using a permanent marker.\n\n, The skater look is all about layering, and a jacket thrown over a shirt can complete the look. A long-sleeved, plaid, flannel shirt can look especially chic when layered over a plain shirt or tied around the waist. When choosing jackets, try not to get anything too form-fitting; you want to be able to move your arms in order to perform tricks on your board.\n\n, Most skater girls like to keep things simple and laid-back. Besides, long, dangling earrings and necklaces will only get in the way while skating. If you want to wear some jewelry, here are some things for you to try:\n\n\nWristbands often come with stamped, printed, or engraved words and phrases. They are a great way to show your individuality.\nSweatbands are comfortable to wear, and are often embroidered with a brand logo. They are a great way to show your support and enthusiasm for your favorite brands and companies.\nStudded bracelets are like mini versions of studded belts. You can find them in shops that sell punk attire.\n\n, They not only keep the sun off your head, but can also keep long hair out of your face. Try finding one that has a logo of your favorite brand. If you can't find one, then get a plain one, and decorate it with a patch or pin. This is a great way to show support for your favorite brands.\n\n, If you'd like to show off your punk side, you can always put on a pair of fingerless gloves. They'll also help protect your palms in case you fall. If you can't find any, you can make your own by getting a pair of leather gloves and snipping the fingers off at the first knuckle.\n\n, Baggy pants can be easy to move in, but if they are so baggy that they are sliding off your waist, you might want to use a belt to keep them up. A studded belt would be a great touch. You can get a standard belt with silver studs, or you can get a belt with colored studs.\n\n, When you aren't listening to music, let the headphones hang around your neck.\n\n\nIf you use earbuds, then you might want to roll them up and put them away so that they don't accidentally fall off and get damaged.\n\n, Most skater girls will have a slight tom-boyish look to them. If you like to wear makeup, limit yourself to a tinted moisturizer and dark-colored eyeliner. If you want to give your lips some color, try wearing some lip gloss.\n\n\nTry a smoky-eye look with thick, black eyeliner. You can also pair this with some tinted moisturizer, but don't add blush, bronzer, contouring, and lipstick, or your makeup will look too heavy.\n\n, You can also tie it back into a ponytail.\n\n\nIf your hair is curly or wavy, you can straighten it or leave it natural.\nIf your hair is already straight, try adding in some beach waves into it for some texture.\nIf you have long bangs, consider braiding them, and pinning them out of the way with a couple of bobby pins.\n\n,\n\n\nIf your hair is too long to spike up, but too short to pull back, try wearing a hat over it. You can also brush it off to the side, or clip your bangs back.\n\n, Keep in mind, however, that if you have really dark hair and want to dye it a lighter color, you will need to bleach it first. If you don't bleach it, the color may not show up. You can dye your bangs a punky color, such as blue, green, or purple. You can also try adding some colored streaks to it.\n\n\nIf you want to dye your hair a punky color, but don't know what color to choose, try using some colored hair chalk in your hair; it will wash out the next time you wash it.\nYou can experiment with streaks by clipping in a colored hair extension.\n\n, The skater style takes some inspiration from the scene and emo style. If you want to get fancy with your hair, this is something you could try. Be sure to cut lots of layers and to texture it with razor scissors. Style it by brushing the bangs off to one side.\n\n\nIf you have curly hair, try straightening just the bangs and leaving the rest of your hair curly. This will create a nice mixture of different textures.\n\n, Almost anything goes when it comes to skater fashion, but most girls will pair a certain pattern, such as florals or checkered, with something solid colored. Here are some patterns and colors commonly seen in skater girl fashion:\n\n\nPlaids\nChecker\nPinstripe\nBlack and white\nBlack and red\nSolid white\nSolid black\n\n, Skater fashion is all about layering baggy and fitted clothes. It's also about combining patterns, such as plaid or checkered, with solids. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n\nWear a long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt.\nPair a plaid button-down shirt with a white fitted shirt.\nWear a loose shirt if you are wearing tight pants, and a fitted shirt if you are wearing baggy pants.\n\n, Skater girl fashion is usually a combination of punk, scene, and tomboy.Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n\nGo monochrome with black jeans, black skater shoes, a faded black or grey vintage t-shirt, and a black and red cap.\nMix and match with a pair of baggy capris, knee-high socks, a fitted shirt, a cap, and a pair of skater shoes.\nPlay with layers by wearing a black \u00be sleeve shirt with a white t-shirt over that. Tie a red, plaid flannel shirt around your waist. Finish the look with some skinny jeans, canvas sneakers, and a cap.\nGo casual with a pair of skinny jeans, a loose-fitting white t-shirt, a pair of canvas sneakers, and a beanie.\n\n, There is nothing wrong with that. Just be sure to layer different textures, colors, and patterns. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n\nTry a red, plaid uniform skirt and a white, button-down shirt. Don't forget to wear a pair of fitted biker shorts under your skirt, especially if you plan on doing some skating that day.\nIf it's a hot day, try wearing a pair of shorts and a white cropped, fitted top. Pair this with a light-colored beanie or a loose-fitting macram\u00e9 top.\nPair a black fitted shirt with a pair of shorts and black canvas sneakers. Wear a red plaid flannel shirt over this to complete the layered look.\nIf you like wearing long pants, you can show off your girly side by pairing loose-fitting jeans with a pink tank top. You can also pair a loose t-shirt with some floral-printed skinny jeans.\n\n, Don't limit yourself to just one wristband. Try wearing several. You can also pair a cap with some fingerless gloves, or a choker necklace with a pair of earphones draped around your neck.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":712}

Add\u00a0\u00bd\u00a0to\u00a0\u00be\u00a0cup of raw or non-homogenized milk and let sit in a dark environment for 24 hours.\n,,\n\nIf it\u2019s thick and creamy, drain the yogurt from the Kefir grains using a strainer.\n\n, Stir in \u00bc to \u00bd cup of kefir yogurt., Always test the temperature while stirring to obtain the exact temperature. While waiting for the milk to warm, dilute \u00bc tsp. of liquid animal rennet into \u00bc cup of purified water., Stir for 30 to 60 seconds and cover for 1 hour., If you have a clean break, it should like Jell-O and will leave a hole. If it is still liquid like, cover for another 30 minutes and try this step again., Resist the urge to keep checking on the milk; it needs to retain the heat for the fermentation process to begin.\n\nAfter 4 hours, the curds should have sunken to the bottom of the whey and will have connected\u00a0back together.\n\n, Try your best to make one solid level piece similar to a pie. Poke several holes on the top of the curd. You will then see whey accumulate in the holes that you created., This should be done right away to get a base line of the pH. Normally, it will be around 6.2 at this point, but it will vary., As a rule of thumb, the desired pH is 5.2. However, this is subjective. For a tougher and denser mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.3 to 5.4. For a softer mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.0 to 5.1.\n\nThe fermentation process can range from 2 to 18 hours depending on the amount of cultures present in the kefir and the climate that you live in. Test periodically after the initial test and then every hour once the pH has reached 5.5 to 5.6 range.\n\n, It should be one solid dense piece at this point. Cut the curd into half inch squares., Place the chopped-up curds into the first bowl, fill the second bowl with cool water and the third with ice and water.,, Do not pour directly onto the curds, but rather around the rim of the mixing bowl., Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of salt onto the cheese curds and then dump 2 to 3 more cups of hot water into the bowl\u00a0and let sit for 1 more minute., If they are ready for stretch, they should stick together and not fall apart. Scoop the curds up and let gravity do its work. The cheese should stick to the spoon and begin to stretch on its own.\n\nYou can assist the stretching by grabbing the bottom of the cheese and pulling it down. If it is too hard to stretch, simply place all the cheese back in the hot water and let it sit\u00a0a little longer. Stretch into a long 2-inch-wide strip and fold over 3 to 4 times.\nDo not over work the stretching because doing so will make for a tough and dry mozzarella cheese. Once you have repeated this process 3 \u2013 4 times and the mozzarella is smooth, it\u2019s time to form the fresh mozzarella balls.\n\n,, Squeeze the bottom of the ball and break it off., Repeat this step until you have made all of the mozzarella balls and let them sit in the cool water for 10 minutes or until they have all cooled down., This preserves the shape of the fresh mozzarella.\n\nThere you have it: you have made fresh mozzarella using cultures. It is ready to eat at this point and is always best right after the stretch.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":713}

{"text":",\n\n\nThe school districts collaborate with the colleges but do not set the requirements. They are decided by the state education agency in coordination with the state teacher colleges.\nDuring the usual alternative certification, you will not do practice teaching because you will already be working as a full-time teacher (you will avoid the traditional, college undergraduate teacher training program that would have been required while the student was a junior and senior in the traditional collegiate training).\nIn some states, for example in Texas, there are state credentialed teacher training companies that are setup under state law as organizations to recruit and prepare already degreed persons to receive alternative certification, without going back to college. The candidate must pass state required general and subject-area (content) teacher tests. Every time you pass a content test it makes you Highly Qualified (HQ) in that subject-area. This is an important step in qualifications for getting hired and certified. There are options, for the candidate, for the required training from the company \"online\" or a combination of \"face to face and online\". The initial cost in the program is a small down payment to the training company, then after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher you must pay the balance on an installment plan.One option is for one year training while teaching full-time. Then the candidate receives a state probationary certificate in that program, and the company will provide training for additional cost after being hired by a school district and working as a teacher. You may pay the balance on an installment plan.\nA second option is \"Clinical Training\", where the candidate can get certified in one semester by doing student teaching in the program.\n\n\nVocational education teachers do not need much or perhaps need no college coursework or only a state certificate in the craft or skill for teaching technical crafts and trade class subjects in general -- but they would be licensed and certified in their field of crafts and skills such as in the building trades and automobile mechanics and other similar areas and courses of training, work and study.\n\n, When there is a vacancy for availability to be hired -- then you would be asked to schedule for an interview to be hired.\n\n, There may be several candidates, and the interviews may be crucial in your being the one chosen\/accepted by the principal of the school and hired.\n\n\nDress and behave professionally; be pleasant and calm.\nYou will be asked on the application and during interviews:\n\nWhy do you want to be a teacher.\nWhat are your long term career goals.\nHow will you handle classroom discipline, and similar questions.\n\n\nBe ready to explain your system of classroom management with consistent teaching practices, \"firm but fair discipline (treating everyone as equals, but as individuals where applicable)\", such as: a \"progressive discipline\" process -- first post and explain 5 or 6 rules; then for instance speak to an offender (and make a record ), next-time schedule a before or after school detention for 5 or 10 minutes in your room , next make a phone call home. Only plan to send a student to the principal\/or assistant principal, if you can not reasonably handle the difficulty, but never letting it get out of hand (very rarely a student might need to be escorted from your room by office personnel, or a hall monitor).\n\n,,,,,\n\n\nYou might in some cases be allowed to try again on a probationary basis to pass the test by a certain date while teaching, or reassigned until your pass the test, if the local district needs or wants to keep you.\n\n,\n\n\nTo be eligible for consideration for such teaching you would be required at least the minimum grade average and number of college credit hours, for example: some states require at least being classified as a senior in good standing with a GPA (grade point average) on a 4 point scale \"C+\" (2.5), or \"B-\" (between 2.5 and 3.0) average in college, and possibly require a \"B\" (3.0) average in your teaching field subject such as math or science.;\n,\n\n\nA teaching field may be similar to taking a minor in a subject: some states require 18 or 24 approved college hours including 12 advanced level credit hours to be completed to become \"permanently\/or provisionally\" certified.\nWhile your degree may be earned in any valid degree subject, and most degree subjects are potentially teaching fields, yet some may not be taught in the schools, yet you may still be hired for teaching a needed subject, if you possess the minimum qualifications.\nTeaching fields become classified as \"needed\" teaching fields as determined by the school district -- depending on their needs and state law.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":715}

{"text":" To file for divorce in Delaware, either spouse must live in the state or be stationed in the state as a member of the military for at least 6 months before the filing of the petition. Only one spouse must meet the residency requirement in order to get divorced in Delaware. Therefore, if you or your current spouse is a resident of Delaware and has been for the past six months, you may file for divorce in Delaware.\nIf neither you or your spouse has lived in Delaware for at least 6 months, you will have to get divorced elsewhere, or wait to file until one of you meets the 6 month residency requirement.;\n, In Delaware, the court will enter a divorce if the parties\u2019 marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken\u201d and reconciliation between the parties is unlikely. You can show that you and your spouse will not reconcile due to one of the following reasons:\n\n\nYou and your spouse are voluntarily living apart. You and your spouse are separated due to your spouse\u2019s \u201cmarital misconduct.\u201d You and your spouse are separated due to your spouse\u2019s mental illness. You and your spouse separated because the two of you are incompatible. , You must file a petition for divorce in the county where you or your spouse lives. This county is where your divorce hearings will take place, and where you will turn in all of your paperwork. , Delaware courts will \u201cequitably distribute\u201d property when a couple divorces. \u201cEquitable distribution\u201d means that the court can distribute all property that either spouse or both spouses have, regardless of whose name it is in and when the property was acquired. When determining how to divide the property, the court, without regard to marital misconduct, will consider the following: The length of the marriage.\nAny prior marriages of the parties.\nThe age, health, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties.\nWhether the property award is in lieu of or in addition to alimony.\nThe opportunity of each spouse for future acquisitions of capital assets and income.\nEach spouse's contribution to or dissipation of the marital estate, including the contribution of a party as homemaker.\nThe value of the property owned by the parties.\nThe economic circumstances of each spouse at the time of the division, including the desirability of awarding the family home to the party who will have custody of any children.\n\n, If you and your spouse have children, the court will come up with a custody and child support arrangement that is in the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d This could mean that you and your spouse will share custody, or the court could award one party full custody. The court will not give any preference to the mother when awarding custody. To determine what custody arrangement is in the best interests of the child, the court will consider the following factors: The wishes of you and your spouse regarding where your child or children will live.\nThe wishes of your child.\nThe child\u2019s relationship with his or her parents, grandparents, siblings, or any other residents of the household or persons who may significantly affect the child's best interests.\nThe child's attachment to his or her home, school and community.\nThe mental and physical health of the parents and child.\nPast and present compliance by both parents with their rights and responsibilities to their child.\nEvidence of domestic violence against the child or against either parent.\nThe criminal history of either parent, and of any person living with one of the parents.\n\n, A party may request alimony for a length of time that is up to 50% of the length of the marriage, unless the parties have been married for 20 years or longer, in which case there is no limit to the amount of time that a spouse can receive alimony. Delaware only allows an award of spousal support (alimony) to a party that is \u201cdependent\u201d on the other spouse. To qualify, the asking spouse must show that he or she is \u201cdependent\u201d because he or she: Lacks sufficient property, including any award of marital property made by the Court, to provide for his or her reasonable needs.\nIs unable to support himself or herself through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it impossible or extremely difficult to work.\nIs dependent on the other party for support, and will not be provided for by anyone else.\n\n, While having an attorney to advocate on your behalf may insure that the divorce process goes smoothly, you may be able to complete the divorce without a lawyer.\n\n\nIf you and your spouse agree on how to divide your property, and if you there are no children involved, you can probably file for divorce on your own and save money. If you do not have an attorney, you and your spouse will be responsible for filing all of your paperwork, and will each talk to the judge without getting any help preparing.\nIf you and your spouse do not agree on how to separate your property, or if you have children and need to come up with a custody arrangement, you should hire an attorney to assist you. A \u201ccontested\u201d divorce where the parties do not agree can be extremely complicated, and you should have an expert to help you get the best possible outcome.\n\n, If you decide to hire an attorney, you should research possible candidates to find one that is right for you. To begin the process, considering doing the following:\n\n\nGet a referral from a friend or family member who has used a divorce lawyer before. Find out who they hired and if they would recommend the attorney. If you can\u2019t get a referral from anyone you know, check online websites like Find Law, Avvo, and Yahoo Local to find a qualified attorney.\nOnce you have a list of attorneys that you think may be a good fit, set up \u201cconsultation\u201d meetings so you can meet face to face. During the meeting, you can ask questions about your case and situation, and gauge whether you get along with the attorney.\n\n, After meeting with potential attorneys, decide which one is the best for your particular situation. You should consider the amount of experience the attorney has, the price he or she will charge, and how well you got along with the attorney.\n\n\nIf, after meeting with an attorney, you think of other questions you would like to ask, don\u2019t hesitate to call back and ask. You should make an informed decision, and the attorney that you are considering should not have any problem answering any and all questions that you may have.\nIf you cannot afford an attorney, you can try to obtain legal help on a \u201cpro bono\u201d (free) basis. To get help finding an attorney, call 302-478-8850 if you live in New Castle County and 1-888-225-0582 if you live in Kent or Sussex County. , To begin the divorce process, will need to fill out a \u201cpetition\u201d to divorce. The petition tells the court why you want to get divorced, and provides the court with your information and your spouse\u2019s information. The petition can be found by clicking here. To fill out the petition, you must include the following information: Your name and address (put in the \u201cpetitioner\u201d spot if you are filing for divorce).\nYour spouse\u2019s name and address (put in the \u201crespondent\u201d spot).\nBoth your date of birth and your spouse\u2019s.\nBoth your occupation and your spouse\u2019s.\nThe names of any children of the marriage.\nThe date that you and your spouse separated.\nDetails regarding your spouse\u2019s \u201cmarital misconduct,\u201d if that is the applicable reason for the divorce.\nDetails regarding your spouse\u2019s \u201cmental illness,\u201d if that is the applicable reason for the divorce.\nWhether you want an \u201cuncontested divorce,\u201d or a \u201ccontested divorce.\u201d Choose \u201cuncontested\u201d if you and your spouse agree on the issues, and \u201ccontested\u201d if you do not.\n\n, The petition must be signed in the presence of a notary public. Do not sign it until you are in the presence of a notary, or you will have to complete the petition again. , In addition to the petition, you must complete an \u201cinformation sheet\u201d and a \u201cvital statistics form\u201d in order to begin the divorce process. Additionally, if you have children with your spouse, you may have to fill out additional forms.\n\n\nInformation Sheet: This form provides the Court with general information about the parties which allows the Court to adequately notify the parties about upcoming proceedings.\nVital Statistics Form: This form will contain similar information to what was included on the Information Sheet. However, the information on this sheet is provided directly to the Division of Public Health and Vital Statistics for their records. This form must be filled out in black ink or typed.\n\n, In order to give your spouse \u201cnotice\u201d of your divorce, you will fill out a Request for Notice form. On this form you will tell the Court how you want to notify your spouse about the divorce action. If your spouse lives in Delaware and you know his or her address, you must ask the Court to personally serve him or her with a copy of the petition. This means that someone will deliver the petition to your spouse.\n\n\nIf you do not know where your spouse lives, you must ask the Court to publish a notice of the petition in the newspaper at your expense. You must also complete an Affidavit that a Party\u2019s Address is Unknown.\n\n, Take all of the paperwork that you have filled out (the Petition, the Information Sheet, the Vital Statistics form and the Request for Notice) to the courthouse in the county where you or your spouse resides. Be prepared to pay a filing fee at the time you file. To find out what the filing fee is, you can look at the Family Court website or go to the Family Court Resource Centers located in each courthouse.\n\n\nIn Kent and Sussex Counties you may file your papers at the Resource Centers on the first floor of the Family Court Building. In New Castle County, you may file your papers at the Resource Center on Lower Level 1 (LL1) of the New Castle County Courthouse. , Your spouse has 20 days from the date of service (the date that he or she receives your petition) to respond to your Petition for Divorce. Your spouse may file an answer to your petition where your spouse may admit or deny any of the statements that you made in your petition. On the answer, your spouse may also \u201ccounterclaim\u201d for divorce. A counterclaim means that your spouse is filing his\/her own petition for divorce, and can ask the court for a different distribution of property or child custody arrangement than the one you asked for.\nThe \u201canswer\u201d uses the same for as the \u201cpetition\u201d and can be found by clicking here.\n\n, However, be aware that you must prove any allegations of misconduct by presenting evidence of the misconduct to the Court before a divorce will be granted on this ground.\nYour spouse was served with the Petition for Divorce and either responded within 20 days or did not respond.\nYou have completed the required Parent Education Classes and filed the Certificate of Completion with the Court if you and your spouse have children.\nYou and your spouse have not lived together for the 30 days preceding the divorce action and have not had sexual relations during that time.\nOnce your petition for Divorce is trial-ready, you will receive a Notice from the Court telling you that your petition is trial-ready and that you can proceed with the divorce process.\n\n, If your petition is uncontested and you marked on the petition that you wanted the Court to proceed without a hearing, you can be granted a divorce without attending a hearing. If you chose not to have a hearing, you will receive a \u201cNotice of Trial-Readiness\u201d telling you that your petition is trial-ready and that you have 20 days to file the following forms: Request to Proceed Without a Hearing: Within 20 days of the date on which you receive your \u201cNotice of Trial Readiness,\u201d you should file this form with an attached copy of your Notice and mail one copy to your spouse. If you fail to file this request within the allotted time, you will have to appear in court to obtain your divorce.\nAffidavit in Support of the Request to Proceed Without a Hearing: This document must be filed along with your \u201cRequest to Proceed Without a Hearing.\u201d On this document you are swearing that the information contained in your divorce petition is true. The Court will rely on this information when making a determination regarding your divorce, so it is extremely important to be honest.\nIf the court grants your request to proceed without a hearing, your divorce will be completed. If not, a hearing will be scheduled for you.\n\n, If the petition was uncontested and you marked on your petition that you wanted to proceed with a hearing or if your spouse contested the divorce petition, you will receive a \u201cNotice of Hearing\u201d notifying you of the date of your hearing. You must come to Court on the day of your hearing for your divorce to be granted. If you fail to appear at the hearing, the Court may dismiss your petition and you will have to start the process over and pay the filing fee again. Make sure you are on time to your hearing, judges often hear more than one divorce at a time, so you do not want to hold everyone up.\nIf the judge asks you any questions, address him or her as \u201cyour honor\u201d and make sure to be polite and respectful.\n\n, Whether your divorce is decided at a hearing or by agreement, you must comply with the \"terms\" that are included in your divorce order. The divorce order is the \"law\" of your divorce, so failing to follow the instructions in the final order could result in legal consequences, such as paying a fine or, in some cases, going to jail.\n\n\nIf there is something in your divorce order that you want or need to change, contact the clerk's office at the court where you were granted your divorce, and ask about \"modification.\"\nIf your former spouse is not complying with the terms of your divorce agreement, contact an attorney to determine your options for making him or her comply.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":717}

{"text":" Vasopressin is a polypeptide or protein hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland from its posterior part. Its secretion is not regulated by hormones from the hypothalamus such as occurs for all hormones of the anterior pituitary gland. Instead, its secretion is stimulated or inhibited based on the state of osmolality of the blood.;\n, Increased osmolality of the blood stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete more of this hormone. On the other hand, low osmolality of the blood inhibits its secretion by the same gland. In addition the volume of blood is also a crucial factor in the stimulation or inhibition of the secretion of this hormone. Increased blood volume or hypervolemia inhibits the secretion of this hormone while low blood volume in the arteries stimulates its secretion such as occurs in a of state of shock.\n\n, The main function of this hormone is to stimulate the re-absorption or conservation of water in the kidney tubules. One of the clinical symptoms to this function is an increase in blood pressure with subsequent development of edema.\n\n, The first disorder that involves this hormone and which is discussed here is the diabetes insipidus disorder. This is a disorder of the posterior pituitary gland in which it secretes the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation in deficient amount. This can occur for example after a surgery to the brain in the region near the pituitary gland which can affect this gland also.\n\n, The net result is the lack of stimulus for the kidney to conserve water in the kidney tubules into the blood circulation with subsequent development of polyurea with very dilute urine. This condition must be distinguished clinically from other diseases that can cause polyurea also such as diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.\n\n,, In this case the pituitary gland secretes this hormone in normal physiological quantity. The only problem arises due to kidney problems in which its cellular receptors for this hormone do not respond properly for the stimulation by the hormone. This type of the disease is called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n,, This disorder is called syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion to the blood. It involves the secretion of excessive amount of the hormone vasopressin to the blood circulation.\n\n,, In addition, many diseases on the central nervous system are associated with increased secretion of this hormone to the blood circulation ectopically.\n\n, The clinical picture of this disorder is of increased amount of water that is conserved in the kidney tubules causing elevated blood pressure or hypertension with subsequent development of edema. The treatment for this condition is to remove the source of malignancy that is causing the secretion of the hormone by surgery.\n\n, This hormone is usually metabolized and neutralized in the liver. In the case of liver failure this metabolism is disrupted so that the half life of it becomes longer which would allow for its lingering in the blood more time. Thus it exerts more effect on the kidney to conserve more water. This would give symptoms that are associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":722}
{"text":" Remove the guitar strings and then unscrew the neck of the guitar from the body. Once the body is standing alone, unscrew the screws and knobs on the front of the guitar. Remove the screws on the pickups and bridge of the guitar.If there is a faceplate over your volume knobs, you'll have to remove the plastic portions of the knobs before you can lift the faceplate off.;\n, Once all of the screws are out on the face of the guitar, you can lift up your bridge and pickups, which are connected by wires. Snip these and solder them later when you put your guitar back together. If you feel unsure about taking your guitar apart, take it to a guitar store so that they can safely do it for you. Make sure all the electrical wiring is removed from the guitar before you start painting it.\n\n, Set your heat gun or hairdryer to the lowest setting and move it back and forth, across the body of your guitar. The heat from your hairdryer or heat gun will soften the finish on your guitar and make it easier to lift up the paint. Continue heating the paint for five minutes and then use a sharp tool to poke at the paint. If the paint feels soft, you can go onto the next step.Do not hold the heat gun in one spot for too long or you may burn the wood that's under the paint.\n\n, Start by scoring a small location on the softened paint. Use your putty knife to lift off the old finish and don't worry if it cracks off. Continue to scrape the paint and remove the old finish without damaging the wood under it. If the paint isn't coming off, use the heat gun again to soften it. Once you're done removing the finish, you should see the wood grain under it., Use a 100 grit sandpaper at first and sand over the surface of the guitar's body in the direction of the grain. Sand down irregularities so that the body of the guitar is as smooth as possible. Follow the contours of the guitar and sand the sides and edges of the guitar as well. Once you've sanded it with the 100 grit sandpaper, you can move to a 200 grit sandpaper to sand out smaller irregularities.Use a sanding block if the sandpaper is hurting your hands.\n\n, As you sand down your guitar, you're likely to find bumps or divots in the body. Fill divots that you can't sand down with an automotive filler. Once the divots are filled, let it dry for at least 20 minutes so that the automotive filler can cure.Bondo is a popular type of automotive filler., Once you've filled in all divots and the guitar is relatively smooth, you'll have to do one last sanding with the 100 grit sandpaper. Continue to sand until the automotive filler lies flush with the body of the guitar., Don't saturate the wood grain on your guitar to prevent moisture from getting absorbed into to the guitar. Take a microfiber cloth or a clean rag and wipe over the surface, making sure to remove any sawdust or debris that might be on the guitar.\n\n\nDebris or dust left on the guitar will get sealed into the paint job.\n\n, Lay down drop cloths under the guitar so that the paint doesn't stain the surface that you're painting on. Alternatively, you can hang the guitar from the ceiling and spray it as it's suspended in the air., You can purchase wood sealer online or at a hardware store. Purchase a water based wood sealer that has a high gloss. If you are painting your guitar a lighter color, use a white sealer and if you're painting it a dark color, apply a gray sealer., Saturate a dry rag in the sealer. Once the rag is saturated, drag it along the grain on the surface of your guitar. Make long movements and do not scrub in a single area with the sealer. Once the back of the guitar is sealed, turn the guitar over and finish sealing the front and sides.Once your rag looks dirty, dispose of it and use another, clean rag.\n\n, Let the sealer dry for an hour or two and come back and apply another even coat of sealer. The sealer will help the colored coats of paint adhere to the body of the guitar much easier. Continue adding more coats of sealer until you've covered the guitar three to five times in total.Remember to let the sealer dry in between each new application.\n\n, Feel over the sealer to make sure that it's no longer wet or sticky. Make sure that the guitar dries in a well-ventilated area so no one gets sick from the sealer's fumes., Using a 200 grit sandpaper, carefully sand over the shiny parts of the sealer. Make sure not to sand too hard or you may expose the wood grain underneath. If you do do this, simply reapply more coats of sealer to the guitar and allow it to dry before moving on. When you're done, the guitar should have a dull white or gray color., Typical guitar paint includes polyester, polyurethane, and nitrocellulose. Polyurethane and polyester will result in a harder, more plastic-feeling finish on your guitar while nitrocellulose is lighter and thinner. If you're unsure of what kind of paint to get, look for spray paint that's made specifically for guitars., Position the nozzle on the spray can 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 cm) away from the body of the guitar. Remember to cover the edges of the guitar. Press down on the button on the spray can and go in long, sweeping back and forth motions across the body of the guitar., Touch the surface of the guitar to make sure that none of the paint transfers to your hand. The paint may still be sticky and you'll still be able to see the sealer under the basecoat that you just sprayed., Once the guitar is dry, flip it over and spray down the other side of the guitar. You should now have one solid basecoat of paint over the front and back of your guitar., Allow each coat of paint to dry for five minutes before applying the next coat. Continue flipping the guitar over so that the entire guitar gets even coverage. Continue to cover your guitar in coats of paint until the paint gets darker and richer. This could take anywhere from three to seven coats of paint., Once you're done laying down the base color for your guitar, you'll have to let the paint dry for another one or two days in a well-ventilated area. Once it's completely dry, you can move onto the next step. , Once the color coat is dry, run your fingers over the surface, sides, and back of the guitar to see if the paint is smooth. If the paint rises too high in some spots or has become bumpy, you should sand it down with a wet sandpaper. Saturate the sandpaper in water overnight, then work it along the rough parts of your guitar while it's still wet.Wet sandpaper will not scratch the surface of your guitar.\n\n, Clear lacquer paint will give your guitar a shiny finish over the paint. You can purchase clear lacquer paint at a home improvement store or online. Spray the clear lacquer the same way you sprayed the base coat, putting four separate coats of lacquer on the guitar and letting the paint dry in between sprays., Don't touch your guitar for three weeks as the paint dries. During this time the paint will cure and should be a rich solid color, but will be missing the polish that guitars typically have., Saturate a rag or cloth with car polish and work it on the surface of the guitar using small, circular motions. This should refine the shine in the guitar and make it more reflective. One you're done polishing the guitar, it should be shiny and reflective.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":723}

{"text":" While it is incredibly exciting to bring a new puppy home, it is also very important that you decide the different duties each family member will play in training your puppy, and the rules you will have for you puppy. Discipline is key-and not just for your pup.\n\n\nFor example, if you have decided that your puppy should sleep in a crate until house trained, do not let anyone allow the puppy to sleep in its bed the first few nights.;\n, The puppy needs clear rules from the first day it arrives at your home. You\u2019ll want to make the rules easy to follow. For example, if you don't want the puppy upstairs, put up a stair gate. If you don\u2019t want a dog begging for food at the table, never feed a puppy food from your plate. Remember not to scold the puppy too much or his\/her trust in you will go down\n\n, It is nearly impossible to train a puppy without some kind of reward involved. Most puppies respond well to food rewards. However, be aware that when training with food rewards, or \"treats,\" you should use small treats, even pieces of regular dog food work!\n\n\nFeeding large treats each time you give a reward will soon make your dog unhealthy and overweight. Use high value treats for new work, for example turkey is very healthy for dogs, and lower value foods, like a piece of dog food, when doing re-training work.\nSome puppies respond better to toys. You can reward a dog that loves fetching by throwing the ball each time he does something correct, or another dog by playing a quick game of tug-of-war. However, toy rewards take up more time, can get the puppy too excited and wound up to train, or may get boring after a while. Toys work especially well for agility training, although agility cannot be trained until 18 months of age because puppy joints and bones can\u2019t handle this type of training.\n\n, Different breeds of dogs are very different, so it would be a good idea to read up on your breed to know what to expect. Each breed needs specific training in order to thrive, so make sure you know what the specific needs of your dog are.\n\n, In combination with any other reward you choose to give your pup, you must also use verbal praise. When your puppy responds correctly, praise it in a high-pitched, kind voice. Puppies respond to a pleased and happy tone.\n\n\nClicker training is also very helpful. In this training, you purchase a clicker and each time you say the command you immediately use the clicker.\nOn the other hand, when your puppy disobeys, you should use a stern voice to reprimand your pup. It is important that puppy learns the difference between your pleased voice and your voice that tells her she did something wrong. Always make up with a dog after you need to scold them.\n\n, Also try to keep the sessions full of new, fun things, like little games you make up yourself. If you see the dog begin to get bored, distracted, or frustrated, end the session and take a break.\n\n\nIf you begin to get frustrated, end the session. However, try to end on a good note, with praise and rewards. This way the puppy will look forward to the next training session.\nTry to stay committed to a 10- 15 minute session every day, so the puppy will learn new commands faster.\n\n, Keep in mind that puppies 12 weeks or under do not have full control of their bladder or bowels. Even if they wanted to \u201chold-it\u201d they simply cannot do that, so do not harshly reprimand them when they eliminate in your house. Most puppies are not fully house trained until they are six months old, and in some cases even older than that.\n\n\nWhen house training your pup, it is important to keep a positive attitude even when you encounter an accident.\n\n, Puppies can generally only hold their waste in for the number of months they are old. So if your puppy is four months old, he should not be left without access to the outside for longer than four hours.It is different at night, as puppies shut down the way we do at night. By the time your puppy is four months old, he should be able to go the entire night without needing to go potty.\n\n, As you may be able to guess, a big part of when a puppy goes potty is when it is fed. In order to speed up the house training process, establish a regular feeding schedule and stick with it. Unless advised by a vet, do not \u201cfree feed\u201d (leaving a filled food bowl out at all times.)\n\n\nFree feeding will give your puppy a random elimination cycle (when she pees or poops) and will not establish you as the provider of the food (which is important in teaching your puppy that you are the pack leader and in charge.)Do not feed your puppy anything in between meals.\n\n, Young puppies generally need to potty every 30 to 45 minutes. You should create a consistent schedule for when you take your puppy out. Puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals, naps, and playtime. You should always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, before you and the puppy go to bed at night, and before you leave the puppy alone for any extended period of time.\n\n, Give your puppy a treat and verbally praise it when it pees or poops outside. Try to bring your puppy to the same spot each time to teach her that this is where she is meant to go potty. When you bring her to the spot, say \u201cgo potty\u201d and wait for her to go.Bringing the puppy to the same spot will help it associate the smells of the spot with going potty. Smells can often prompt a puppy to eliminate.\nStay with your puppy outside while it is potty training so you can immediately praise it when she goes potty. Keep in mind that some puppies will go potty as soon as your take them outside, while others may need to sniff around or play a bit before they can eliminate.\n\n, Common signs are sniffing, circling, whining, leaving the room and pacing. Take your puppy outside as soon as possible when you see these signs. You must watch your puppy carefully.\n\n\nIf you see your puppy begin to eliminate in an inappropriate spot indoors, clap twice sharply. Your clapping will startle your pup, stopping it in midstream. Quickly run with your puppy outside, either by leading it with its collar, or encouraging it to run beside you.\nOnce outside, keep the puppy in one place and allow it to eliminate. When it does, verbally praise it and give it a treat. If the puppy doesn\u2019t have anything to eliminate, don\u2019t worry, just make sure to try to be there the next time it does so that you can bring it outside.\nDon\u2019t scold the puppy and never rub its nose in an accident. Just clean up the mess and try to get the puppy outside next time.\n\n, This is especially important to do when you are not home. Choose a crate or area that you can block off with a pen or baby gate and \u2018puppy proof\u2019 the area. Lay down newspapers and put its bed, toys, water and food bowls in the space. Over the course of a few weeks, you will notice that your puppy begins to pee or poop in one particular spot in the area.You can begin reducing the amount of newspaper you use in the space, so that eventually only the place the puppy has designated as her elimination spot is covered with newspaper. You will then be able to slowly start moving the newspaper to other locations closer and closer to the outside door and the puppy will continue to eliminate on them.\nIf your puppy eliminates somewhere other than the designated spot, you may have reduced the amount of newspaper too much, or moved the newspaper away from the original spot too quickly. Potty training a puppy takes a long time, just remember to be patient.\nPraise your puppy when it eliminates in the designated spot. If your puppy has an accident but you do not catch her in the act, you should not reprimand her. She will not understand why you are reprimanding her for something she did an hour ago. If you do catch her right after she has had an accident, hold her near the accident and firmly say \u201cno.\u201d\n\n, When your puppy has become generally reliable in using its \u2018potty area\u2019, you can begin to let the puppy explore more of your house. Its best to open the house up to your puppy one room at a time. Only do this when your puppy can be supervised--any time your puppy cannot be supervised, but her back in her \u2018den.\u2019Put your puppy on a leash when it is exploring a new room. It is much more difficult for your puppy to get into trouble when you are attached to the other end of the leash.\n\n, Puppies explore their new world through their mouths. So they will probably bite you during their exploration or when they are playing. Puppies don\u2019t know that their teeth can feel like razors piercing our skin when they gnaw on us, which is why it\u2019s important to train your puppy not to bite at an early age.\n\n, Puppies don\u2019t know how hard their biting can be. When you are playing with your puppy, allow it to mouth on you if it is doing so already. When it bites too hard, yelp or let out a loud \u2018ow!\u2019 Doing this will startle your puppy and make it stop biting you. Ignore your puppy for 10 to 20 seconds after it has bitten you, or walk away for 10 to 20 seconds. Then go back and resume playing. When it bites too hard again, say \u201cow!\u201d again and ignore it for another 20 or so seconds. Doing this teaches your puppy that gentle play continues, while painful play stops.\nOnce your puppy has stopped biting you very hard, you can begin to teach it to not bite even moderately hard. Repeat the steps listed above when it bites you moderately hard. Continue this process until your puppy only mouths on you gently or doesn\u2019t mouth on you at all.\n\n, If you puppy likes to ambush your feet while you walk, carry a toy in your pocket. When you puppy begins nipping at your foot, freeze, take out the toy and wave it so that it gets his attention. When your puppy has started chewing on the toy, begin walking again. Eventually your puppy will learn that chewing on toys is better than chewing on feet.If you don\u2019t have a toy, freeze when your puppy begins nipping at your feet. When it stops, praise it and go get it a toy.\n\n, When you see your puppy chewing on something like a shoe, furniture, or sock, take the object away from him and scold him verbally. Direct its attention to something it can chew on, such as a favorite toy, and praise it when it begins chewing on that instead. Doing this teaches your puppy what objects to chew on and what not to.\n\n\nIf your puppy continues to chew on things it shouldn\u2019t be, you can use a taste deterrent, like bitter apple, to get it to stop chewing on those objects. You can buy taste deterrents at your local pet store. Bitter apple works well, as the bad taste will cause your puppy to stop chewing on the object immediately.\n\n, Every dog should know the sit command. If you want your dog to be obedient, safe, and able to learn more complicated tricks, you must teach the sit command first.Have a treat ready to go. You should use a treat to teach this command, unless your dog doesn't like food rewards.\nYour puppy should be on a leash. The leash will help you to guide your pup\u2019s movements.\nHold the treat in front of your puppy's nose. While gently pulling the leash up, move the treat upwards, keeping it by your puppy's nose.\nYour puppy will most likely follow the treat up, automatically landing in a sit. If not, gently push your puppy's rear down. As soon as your dog lands in a sitting position, say \"Sit!\" Then give a treat and praise.\nRepeat the steps frequently and be patient. Some dogs take longer to learn than others. Once your puppy begins to recognize the word \"sit,\" say it just before your dog actually sits. With time, patience, and practice, your dog should eventually learn to sit on command.\n\n, Once your puppy learns to sit, it needs to learn to lay down on command. Start with your puppy in the sitting position. Once again, have a treat ready. Your puppy should be on a leash so you can control its movements.Hold the treat where your puppy can see it, in front of its nose. You may want to kneel so you are lower to the ground.\nKeeping a little pressure on the leash, so the puppy can't get the treat, move the treat slowly onto the ground. The puppy should lay down to get a little closer to the treat.\nIf this doesn't work, apply slightly more pressure to the leash. Pull the collar downwards, while moving the treat. Once your puppy is laying down, say \"down\" and give the reward.\nEventually say \"down\" right before the puppy lays down. Continue to practice these steps eventually your puppy will learn how to lay down when he hears the command.\n\n, This is another important safety command. You need to have control over your dog and know that it will come to you when asked.\n\n\nKeep your puppy on a leash. Tell it to either sit or lay down. Take a few steps away and kneel down. Have a favorite toy with you.\nEncourage your puppy by saying its name in an excited voice. Do not apply pressure to the leash. Show the puppy its toy. Pat your knees. Continue to talk in an encouraging voice.\nWhen the puppy begins to come to you, say \u201cCome!\u201d When it gets to you, praise and reward it.\nContinue to practice this, gradually doing these steps from further away.\nOnce your puppy knows the command, try calling it while it\u2019s playing.\n\n, This is one of the most important safety commands. Your puppy must know how to stay in one spot. This is important when taking walks, playing outside, greeting other people and dogs, etc.Keep your puppy on a leash. This time, do not show it the treat, but keep it ready to reward the puppy when the time comes.\nHave your puppy sit. Firmly, say \"Stay.\" Hold your hand in front of the puppy just above its head. Your hand should be where the puppy can easily see it. Until your puppy has learned the command, do not move your hand. It will help it stay focused and get the message.\nVery slowly, while maintaining eye contact with the puppy, take a small step backwards. If the puppy begins to move, say in a sharp, loud voice, \"Ah ah!\" That will get the pup's attention and let it know it has done something wrong. Do not be upset, it does not yet know the command. Instead, firmly but gently put the puppy back in the same place, once again in a sit. The puppy must be in the same place or it will think that it can get away with moving forward even in a stay. Repeat the command and try again.\nWhen the puppy stays, say \"Okay!\" and let it get up and come to you. Praise the puppy and give it a reward.\nContinue practicing the command. Once the puppy has learned the command, gradually move farther away from it and have it wait longer until you give the command to break the stay.\n\n, After your puppy has learned the basic commands, and is following your commands consistently and promptly, you can work on \u201ctrick\u201d types of training. There are many good books and internet articles around that can help you find out the best tricks for your puppy to learn and the best way to teach these types of commands.\n\n\nTeach your dog how to roll over. Your friends will be impressed and overwhelmed with how cute your dog is when it rolls over.\n\nTeach your puppy how to high five. Its important to get your kids involved in the training process of your puppy, so why not have them train your puppy to do something both the dog and child will both enjoy?\n\nTeach your dog how to do the doggie dance. Can you think of anything cuter than a puppy doing a little dog dance?\n\nTeach your puppy how to shake hands. Shaking hands is a classic trick that all dogs should learn.\n\nTeach your puppy to play fetch. Puppies have a lot of energy. Why not teach your dog a trick that will burn off some of that puppy energy?\n\n, Join in a puppy training class so your puppy can learn from other puppies, and their owners, and learn in a more distracting environment. Your local veterinarian, extension service, or pet store can help you find a good puppy training class in your area.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":726}

On these, you should attach the 1 x 2 air intake piece.\n\n, Then:\n\n\nUse 1 x 8 and 1 x 4 pieces evenly to the outside of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece to make you truck bed walls.\nLeave one row of studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece for the hitch and license plate.\n\n, Much like you did with the front end, you will use your license plate holder piece to create the back of your truck. On the left and right recessed studs on the top four-across row of your rear end, add red sloped pieces, slopes facing outward. Between these, attach your license plate.\n\n, This includes a flat, yellow 1 x 4 piece with black diagonal slashes on it. This will be your read bumper. Attach it so that it stretches across the bottom of your license plate holder piece.\n\n, On the free four studs at the very back of your 4 x 12 truck bed piece, connect your rear end. Make sure the edges meet with the walls of the bed of your truck and the rear end piece is firmly fastened.\n\n, Then, stretching across the gap made by the 2 x 8 pieces:\n\n\nAttach two 2 x 4 blocks, on on top the other, so that both are flat against the back wall of your cabin.\nAttach two 1 x 4 pieces behind the 2 x 4 blocks.\nThis should create an flat surface that is level with the roof of your cabin.\n\n, A single row of studs should hang free the hood\/window area of your truck.\n\n\nAttach your sloped window atop the 4 x 8 on the front-most studs.\n\n, The hood cover should go in the front-center of the 4 x 8 piece for the most realistic effect. Use 1 x 8 smooth pieces on the top of the walls of the bed of your truck.\n\n\nLeave two free studs on the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.\n\n, On top of this block, add a 2 x 2 flat piece, and atop that add a 2 x 2 spinning piece. This will allow the front wheels of your car can turn left and right. Now you can press your wheels onto the circular axles on the outside of the 2 x 4 axle piece.\n\n, Then:\n\n\nAttach the wheel assembly so the wheels stick out under the half circles of the fenders.\n\n, You're going to need to fashion two 2 x 2 half axles into a single piece to give the rear wheels of your truck more width. Use a 2 x 2 piece attached to the underside of the two half axles to create one 2 x 4 axle.\n\n, Then on the 2 x 4 block, add two 2 x 2 pieces, or a single 2 x 4 piece, so that all piece form flat sides.\n\n, Then push your wheels onto the rear axle to finish the assembly.\n\n\nAttach your wheels so the back edge of your connecting block is beneath the fourth stud from the rear of the bed of your truck.\nYou might also experiment with rear wheel placement to find what looks best for you.\nDo not attach your wheel assembly to the very back of the underside of the bed of your truck; you will need some space to attach the hitch of your truck.\n\n, Your hitch begins with a 2 x 6 flat piece. Take this 2 x 6 and add to the back-most two studs a 1 x 2 hitch piece. The hitch piece should have a round, upward facing part, which is the hitch.\n\n, You should allow your hitch to stick out from the back of your truck about three studs. This will make your truck hitch look more realistic.\n\n, The bed of your truck closest to the cabin still has a slight gap. Close this off to complete the bed of your truck. Do this by attaching two 1 x 2 pieces on top of each other. Then:\n\n\nAttach your 1 x 2 pieces between the walls of the bed of your truck closest to the cabin.\n\n, Then put a 1 x 1 piece with a circular stud on the side on the rear corner of your 2 x 4 flat where it attaches to the sloped piece.\n\n\nThe 1 x 1 piece with a circular side stud is where your LEGO truck can be filled up with fuel.\n\n, The free hanging back four studs of your flat 2 x 4 piece should be pressed into the bottom of your car base beneath the driver's side door. Then, open the door and put a LEGO figurine inside. It's time to go truckin'!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":727}

The remainder of this article will take you through that process.\n\n, If you can afford a family law attorney, you should consider hiring one to help you navigate the custody process. See this article for directions on how to find a good family law attorney. Even if you cannot afford a full-service attorney, many attorneys provide limited services at a reasonable cost. This means you may be able to hire an attorney to prepare your documents, give you limited legal advice, or potentially even teach you about this area of the law, without having to pay the attorney to take on the entire custody process.\n\n, You will file your petition for joint custody in the same court you opened your family law case in. Generally, you will open your family law case in the country where your child lives.This is true even if you live in a different county.\n\n, In order to petition the court for joint custody of your child, you will have to fill out a request for an order.This form will require you to divulge information including your request for custody and the facts supporting your request.These facts should indicate why you deserve custody of the child and how your custody request will be in the best interest of that child.\n\n\nBecause you are petitioning the court for joint custody, you will need to decide what type of custody you are going to seek. You could seek either physical or legal custody, or you could seek to share either or both of those duties with the other parent. Regardless, because you are filing for joint custody, you will not be asking for full control of both the legal and the physical responsibilities of the child.\n\n, Once you have filled out the required forms to request a custody trial, you will want to review them carefully. These forms are going to be the basis of your custody argument, so you want to make sure they have been filled out accurately and completely. If you will not have the help of an attorney, consider using some of the free legal resources available to you. For example, in California, you can contact a family law facilitator or a self-help center for assistance with these forms.If you are in California, use this link and this link for more information about those resources.\n\n, Once your forms have been reviewed and you have determined they are ready to file, you will want to go to your local courthouse to file them. At the courthouse, file your forms with the clerk of courts.The clerk of courts will take possession of your forms and will require you to pay a filing fee.Fees will differ from state to state, and even county to county. If you cannot afford the fee, you can always ask for a fee waiver.In order to receive a fee waiver, you will need to show some sort of financial hardship.For example, you could show that you are receiving public benefits or that you do not have enough income to provide for basic necessities and pay the filing fee., When you serve the other party, you will hire someone (the sheriff or another competent adult) to give a copy of your filed documents to the other party to look over and respond to. To serve the other party, the person you hire must provide the required documents to them, either in person or through the mail.If you are serving someone through the mail, it must be sent by certified mail. In Pennsylvania, this process must be completed within 30 days of filing your documents with the court.In some states (e.g., Michigan), your answer must also be served on the other party at least five days before the hearing if you provided service through the mail, and at least three days before the hearing if you have the other party served personally.For more information about serving another party, look here.\n\n\nIn addition to serving the other party with the documents you filed with the court, you will also serve the other party with a blank response form and a blank Declaration Under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.These documents will be used by the other party in order to respond to your filed lawsuit.\n\n, Once you have successfully served the other party with your petition for joint custody, the other party will have an opportunity to respond to your petition. When the other parent answers your petition, they will have the option of agreeing with your requests or denying some or all of your requests. Also, the other parent may fail to file an answer at all.\n\n\nIf the other parent declines to file an answer, you could file for a default judgment.\nA default judgment cannot resolve all issues, however. For example, the court can modify visitation if the child is in your state but the other parent lives out of state. But the court probably cannot modify an order for child support from the out-of-state parent.\n\n, If the other party filed an answer and you did not get a default judgment, some courts will require you and the other party to take part in mediation before you can go to court.If your court requires mediation, you and the other party should make a good faith effort to agree on the terms of custody there, which will allow you to avoid the trial process. For more information about mediation, look here.\n\n, If you and the other party took part in mediation, and you came to an agreement allowing you to have joint custody of your child, get the agreement signed by the court and that will act as your valid custody order.\n\n\nIn California, in order to validate a custody agreement, you must first fill out a Stipulation and Order for Custody. Once you fill out this form, you will obtain the judge's signature on your stipulation and you will file it with the clerk of courts., If you were unable to reach an agreement during mediation, or if your court does not require or offer mediation services, you will have to go to court and tell a judge why you deserve joint custody of your child. Since you are asking for joint custody, the court will look to a variety of factors to determine what is in the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201dThese factors will differ by state. They will be listed in either a statute passed by the legislature or in a court opinion issued by your state supreme court.\n\n\nCourts will look at different factors, depending on the state. Michigan, for example, considers: the love and affection existing between the parties and the child; the ability and willingness of the parties to provide food, shelter, clothing, and medical care; moral fitness of the parent; stability of the custodial environment; and mental and physical health of the parties, among other factors.Among a variety of factors, Kentucky considers the wishes of the child; the child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community; the mental and physical health of all individuals involved; as well as the interaction and interrelationship of the child to each parent and to siblings.To find the specific factors for your state, search online for \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d and then your state.\nUnderstanding what you must prove at court will clarify the kinds of evidence you should seek during the discovery process. For example, you will need to prove your physical health, your willingness to provide food and medical care, as well as a stable home environment. You will also need to fend off attacks to these same characteristics.\n\n, Studies in developmental psychology have shown that the child has formed deep attachments in the first three years of life. Severing the attachment between one parent and the child, especially if the child lived with both parents during these years, can have psychological ramifications.This concept is well-known throughout domestic relations courts, so if the child has been in the custody of both parents for three years, simply state to the court that it is in the best interests of the child to continue to have relationships with both parents.\nIn order to show that you're considering your child's best interests, include evidence that you live close to the child\u2019s school in the home that the child grew up in, that your job would not take time away from caring for the child, and that you do not have any illnesses that could interfere with the child's care.\n\n, Write down what classes he or she is taking. Write down who are his or her doctors, teachers and other important influences.\n\n\nInclude details about memories that you have with your child from when you last had custody. If you have visitation with your child currently, make sure that you ask him or her what is going on in school and with friends.\nIf you are unable to get information on your child\u2019s current activities, make sure you know basics about your child, such as your child\u2019s age and grade in school, before attending the hearing.\n\n, To show that you can provide a safe and stable environment for your child, show that you live near your child\u2019s school. This will demonstrate that your child will not be taken out of their routine when they stay with you. They will also not have to endure a long and stressful commute.\n\n, You should demonstrate that you will be in the home when your child is there. This means that you will not regularly leave your child with a babysitter or alone while you work or are otherwise busy. Otherwise, show that you will have someone who is familiar to the child stay with him or her if you must be away from home.\n\n\nFor example, if you have to work some nights that your child would be staying with you, you could show that the child\u2019s grandparent or other relative will available to stay with the child while you are gone.\n\n, To have custody, you must prove to be mentally and emotionally fit and physically able to take care of a child. You cannot have a physical or mental sickness that could cause you to neglect your child or put your child in danger in any way. Establish proof of good physical and mental health with a statement or medical records from your primary physician.\n\n\nSomeone who is suffering from an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia would not be able to gain custody of a child. Because of this condition, the child could be placed in a dangerous situation.\n\n, If you do have any conditions that could interfere with your ability to be the primary caregiver for your child, you should show the court that you have taken steps to proactively address the condition. Additionally, explain why the condition will not interfere with your abilities and duties as a parent.\n\n\nFor example, if you have been diagnosed with mild depression, you should disclose your medical history to the court. Explain that you regularly see a therapist and that you have been on medication for X number of years.\nYou should also include information that shows that you have never put your child in danger because of a medical condition. This could simply be a statement stating \u201cI have never put my child in danger because of my condition (whatever it is).\u201d\n\n, Show that you do not have issues with abuse. This includes mental, physical and sexual abuse, as well as drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n, It\u2019s a good idea to think about reasons that joint custody would be the best for your child. If you are worried about remembering your arguments, feel free to write them down, along with any other thoughts you have on the custody process.\n\n, The first pretrial stage you will encounter will be discovery.During discovery, you will have the opportunity to collect facts, get witness statements, find out what the other party is going to say at trial, and get an idea of how good your case is.If you take part in informal discovery, you may conduct interviews with witnesses, collect documents, and take photographs.These are all considered informal discovery processes because they are things you can do on your own while working with cooperative people.If you need to use formal discovery, you will utilize various tools to require uncooperative parties to give you information you need.These tools include: interrogatories, which are written questions the other party must answer; depositions, which are in-person interviews with an opposing party or witness; requests for documents, which asks the other party to produce documents you want to see; and requests for admissions, which will involve you asking another party whether certain statements are true., Oftentimes, during the preliminary stages of a custody lawsuit, the court will require you and the other parent to go through a custody evaluation, which will then be submitted to the court. A custody evaluation will usually be a report, written by a professional, opining on the parenting skills and abilities of you and the other party.\n\n\nYou will likely have to take part in multiple interviews, some being conducted with the other party and others being conducted alone.The evaluator will ask questions to try and determine if giving you joint custody will be in the best interests of the child. For example, you may be asked, \u201cHow do you show love for the child?\u201dAlso, you may be asked to provide the evaluator with community and school records. The evaluator may want school records, such as disciplinary violations, or a record of the community activities the child participates in. You will need to sign a release for the evaluator to access them.The evaluator may also want a \u201chome record.\u201d This consists of information about the child\u2019s behavior (outgoing or withdrawn), as well discipline problems and relationships with siblings., Towards the end of your preparations for trial, you will have to schedule a time to actually conduct the trial. To do this, contact the clerk of courts and request a trial date. You may have to go in front of a judge in order to convince them that the trial date that is set will work for both parties and that everyone will be prepared.\n\n, When your trial date arrives, get to the courthouse early. You will be required to go through a security checkpoint, which will look and feel a lot like airport security. Once you get through security, go to your courtroom and wait until your case is called.\n\n, An important part of being successful in court involves dressing professionally. A courtroom is considered a professional and serious venue, so you need to dress that way. Always wear a suit if you have one. You should always avoid wearing shorts, sandals, and hats.\n\n, You or your lawyer will need to give the judge a roadmap of what the evidence will show. The opening statement should be brief, but should summarize what evidence will support your claim to full custody.\n\n\nDo not engage in argument. Emotions can run high in a custody hearing, but there is nothing to argue about during the opening statement because no evidence has been admitted into court yet.\n\n, As the petitioner (the person seeking joint custody), you will present witnesses first. The respondent (the other parent) will then have an opportunity to cross-examine each witness.\n\n\nDo not ask leading questions.A leading question states a fact and then asks the witness to agree. For example, \u201cYou never spank your child, do you?\u201d is a leading question. Instead, the lawyer should ask a series of questions such as \u201cHow often does your son misbehave?\u201d \u201cDo you punish him?\u201d \u201cHow do you punish him?\u201d Then the attorney can ask, \u201cHave you ever spanked your son?\u201d\nAsk witnesses to identify any documents you want introduced into evidence. You must first elicit testimony that a document is what you claim it is before it can be admitted into evidence.\n\n, The purpose of cross-examination is to either discredit the witness or to minimize the testimony by showing that the witness is biased or lacking in sufficient knowledge to testify about the matter.\n\n\nYou can impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement. If a witness ever praised you as a parent, then that statement can be introduced if the witness now claims on the stand that you are a bad parent.\nIf someone testifies that you and your child fight, then you can minimize the damage by highlighting how infrequently the witness sees you with your child.\nAlways try to remain calm. If you feel anger overwhelming you, close your eyes for five seconds and breathe deeply.\n\n, You or your lawyer will summarize your case, explicitly linking evidence to the best interest of the child factors provided in you state\u2019s statute.\n\n\nCounter bad facts as best as you can. If you don\u2019t have a clean criminal record, then concede that fact before highlighting the evidence that shows you have lived responsibly for the past several years.\n\n, Once your trial is over, the judge will make a decision regarding your case. If you prevail, you will have obtained joint custody of your child. If you were unsuccessful at trial, you can choose to appeal the judge's decision if you think they made a mistake.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":731}

You need to know if you'll have to shell out additional monies to bring the car up to specifications before you can register it, should you choose to purchase it.\n\n, Open a new browser and select a service record\/accident reporting service website. Key in the Vin number and check for any accidents\/repairs that might indicate that the car is likely to have serious mechanical or structural problems. Look for a previous \"Salvage\" title on the vehicle and the most recent odometer reading. It is more difficult to register and insure a vehicle with a \"Salvage\" title, and a vehicle with high mileage (high odometer reading) may require more expensive maintenance and repairs in order to get it to, or keep it in roadworthy condition.\n\n, Make sure you see the vehicle during the daytime and can spare up to an hour to examine it yourself, and have a mechanic check it over for you.\n\n, This will afford you the opportunity to arrive early and observe the owner driving the vehicle into the lot. As they arrive, you should be looking for things like: Is there smoke coming from the vehicle? Is the vehicle making any strange knocking or ticking noises? Do the breaks or tires squeal as they turn into a parking space and come to a stop? When the owner turns the vehicle ignition off, does the car immediately stop running, or does it make odd choking\/knocking noises? And finally, what does the owner do when they exit the vehicle (assuming they have not seen you yet)? Does he or she wipe down the car to ensure it looks sparkly? Or does the man or woman grab a bottle out of the car and pop the hood to top off fluids?\n\n, Ask to see the title and registration and compare them with any inspection stickers you may find on the windshields of the vehicle. Note any discrepancies and question the owner about them. If in doubt about who the car is titled and registered to, ask for the owner's drivers license and the vehicle insurance paperwork. If there is any discrepancy, regardless of your feelings about the person or vehicle, find another car. The name should be the same (signature included) on each piece of documentation.\n\n, Walk around the vehicle and visually inspect each tire and wheel well. Look for signs of tire weakness or failure. Run your hand over each tire, feeling for uneven tread wear. (this may indicate poor wheel alignment gone unchecked, or worse, a wracked car frame causing uneven contact between the tires and the ground). Stand at the front corner of each side of the vehicle and look down the body for indications of dents or abnormalities in the body that might indicate a previously damaged vehicle. Such indications might include: wavy body panels, inconsistencies in the paint texture or shine, inconsistent rust patterns, or a suddenly way-too-talkative owner. At the front and rear of the vehicle, kneel down and look under the vehicle. At the front, look for a different paint color or overspray consistent with the vehicle paint color. Look at the inside line between the front and back tire on each side of the vehicle for obvious alignment problems or evidence that the car has been in a frame-wracking crash. Make sure all light lenses are in good condition. At the rear of the vehicle, examine the first few inches of the tailpipe with a flashlight. Look for rust or holes, then examine the length of the pipe for defects such as missing clamps, holes, excessive rust. While you're on your knees, examine the entire undercarriage of the vehicle for rust, failing pieces (even if you're unsure what each piece actually is), and deep scrapes or scratches that indicate significant impact against the underside of the vehicle.\n\n, Often, while you're looking closely at their vehicle, an owner who's neglected to mention problems he or she is aware of, will begin acknowledging, or even pointing out indications of an accident, repairs, or damage done to the vehicle, and provide you with details that can help you decide whether the vehicle is a good investment., Upon opening each cabin door, check to ensure that the windows and locks perform properly and that the glass is solid. Inside the driver's side door, on the frame of the vehicle, you should find a sticker with the vehicle's Vin number stamped on it; compare this number with the Vin number the owner has provided you. Examine the interior, and atop and under the seats for rust (a window, windshield or sunroof leak left unrepaired for a period of time will result in rust on the interior fabrics that is difficult to remove. If you see any, feel along the gasket of adjacent windows for signs of weakness or failure). In the trunk, look for signs of rust, loose compartments, missing or damaged spare tire\/tire changing equipment.\n\n, If you spot nothing, get up and start your examination under the hood. Look for any visible sign of a bent frame near the grill area, then examine the radiator for damage to the screen or holes. If nothing else of the engine is visible, ask the owner for any repair and maintenance records they might have and where they have their vehicle serviced. Look for indications in the records that the motor or transmission has been changed.\n\n, Follow them to the service center and observe how the car drives and how the owner drives it. If, at leaving red lights, the owner punches it instead of driving normally, make a note to ask your mechanic to check for potential transmission problems. If the owner has to re-start the vehicle at any time during the drive, be wary. Watch for braking problems and steering problems. If the car looks like it is crabbing down the roadway, like the front and back tires are not in a straight line, the car frame needs thorough inspection for significant frame damage.\n\n, Relate what the owner has told you about the vehicle and ask if what he or she sees is consistent with what you've been told. Ask them if they would buy the vehicle for the price the owner is asking, and how much it will likely cost you to make any necessary repairs to the vehicle.\n\n,, Take a moment to gather your thoughts and process what you've heard and seen regarding the vehicle. If, after a few moments, you feel unsure and hesitant, thank the owner and proceed no further. If, on the other hand, you are certain that this is the right car for you, at nearly the right price, return to the owner and make him or her an offer to purchase the vehicle. Use the information you've gained from your examination of the vehicle and your mechanic's advice to negotiate with the owner until you agree on a purchase amount.\n\n, Make sure you have the title to the vehicle signed and dated by the owner and by you before you leave. Under no circumstances should anyone except you drive the vehicle from this moment forward. The owner will need to make arrangements to return him or herself home, but it would be unwise for you to accompany them, or provide them with a ride.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":733}

{"text":" Before the opening credits flashed, the host would generally say \"On your mark...get set....Go!!!!\" then a game would be played. Though the directions of this game were never formally introduced to home-viewers, by watching this game, you'd see how each of these games were played.Generally, players had to fill a beaker of water that contained a large yellow line, or toss a number of props across a line to another player on stage with a number of different games. Sometimes it would be a water relay where players would have to fill a beaker with water from a variety of items, to sometimes players having to throw and catch props that could be any number of possible items into bigger-sized mock stage-props where their teammate would be situated. Once that toss-up challenge on stage was completed, a dinging sound would be heard and the game would end. The introductory credits would then display with a loud \"splash\" sound as the title pane appeared. Contestants would walk up to their contestant podium to dry off and complete the rest of the game.;\n, This will be described below., Once dried off, the host would introduce both teams (team structure and team colors will be talked about later). He'd go over the rules. Generally, it sounded like these rules were well rehearsed and the rules never changed from episode to episode and never dropped or changed even the simple rules. The team who won the introductory round won control of the first question. The host would generally use these lines: \"I'm going to ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer or think the other team hasn't got a clue, you can dare them to answer it for double the dollars. But, be careful, because they can always double dare you back for four times the amount, and then you'll have to either answer that question or take the physical challenge.\" )., They could answer it or pass it to the other team (or by playing strategy if they knew it but wanted more money and thought the other team might not know) - saying \"Dare\". The question would then fall on the other team onstage, who could answer it or pass it right back - all by saying \"Double Dare\". However, when it got passed back to the initial team who originally passed it (with the \"Dare\" response), the team could answer the question or take what's called the Physical Challenge - a short game (most games lasted no longer than 45 to 60 seconds) that utilized the team's physical traits or muscle. After several of these question-answer-challenges were asked, points were doubled and more questions were asked. After a brief set of advertisements, the show came back, and there was another toss-up round without the \"on your mark\" mentioning. Dollar or point values were doubled following this and were answered in the same style as before the advertisement. The team with the highest point (and later money) values on the board generally won the game and was able to go for the grand prize in what was called the 8-itemObstacle Course.\n\nPlayers would win points (and later money) for answering the questions(or for completing a physical or toss-up challenge or to the full extent). Generally, it was $10 ($20 for toss up or during Family Double Dare ($50)\/Double Dare 2000 ($25 with normal questions winning $25 points upon not having a dare placed, and having won a physical challenge ($40 later escalating to $100 during Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000) there'd be money involved and control of the next question., Although Physical Challenge challenges varied, physical challenge times varied not only by the type of challenge that occurred, but by the year the episode was taped (and most often by the exact show that was shown in the series). Most often times, this challenge lasted 45 seconds but could have been changed to become longer or shorter as the challenge varied.\n\nSometimes during the series run of both Super-Sloppy and Family Double Dare run, the host would mention that each physical challenge is tried with sample families and always tested to be easy enough to complete. But time and time again, some challenges are easier done off-stage than on and some challenges just didn't make the cut for some players to successfully complete.\n\n, If the teams passed these obstacles, they'd end up winning a grand prize. If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle that was successfully played, they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted never resulted in a prize won and they wouldn't be able to complete the remainder of the challenges. Players on the teams reaching this stage of the game had to win the obstacles, by finding a marked hidden red flag on the top of a pole that was as high as the obstacle allowed them to reach or in a mess of Nickelodeon rather edible liquid concoctions (such as the event The Sandwich or the pizza or the famous \"In Da Nose\" (where players had to reach up into a giant nose to find a flag inside the giant nostrils). Whether it was rolling down a slide filled with gooey substances (that were actually edible) to find a flag as you went down it, a ball pit-like pool (or sometimes was filled with water and mock alligator balloons) where the contestant had to make his way across to find the flag at the top of the pole or reaching down into a huge pool of colorful whipped cream that represented ice cream or one of a variety of things, as long as you were able to hand off the red triangular flag with the number of the obstacle on it to your partner who would rush from the end of your obstacle to theirs and completed theirs and switched off, completed that obstacle and handed that one off, your team would win the grand prize along with all the prizes successfully accomplished along the way.\n\nThe obstacle course was a timed challenge. Generally, the obstacle course would last for no more than 60 seconds, though sometimes to a kid, this felt a whole lot longer...\n\n, Although this varied by show, by the time this show became called Family Double Dare and later Double Dare 2000 (both of these you will learn about later in this article), the grand prize generally was trips to various family-fun places including sometimes Universal Studios Florida (later called Universal Orlando) (However, with this being taped at Universal Studios Florida at the time, this kind of broke the fun for the family for another separate family vacation here, when they've been in this park already.) If teams got partially through the obstacles, each obstacle they got through they'd win a prize for while others that weren't completely attempted they wouldn't win the prize for., During this show, Nickelodeon supplied players with a free T-shirt with the Double Dare, Super Sloppy Double Dare, Family Double Dare or Double Dare 2000 logo (depending on which exact year this show was being filmed). Players were given either a blue shirt or red shirt along with an interesting (and sometimes even rhythmically rhyming) name. While the blue team would stand to the host's right, the red team would stand to the host's left. Players would also be given a free pair of sneakers - most often times these were Reeboks, while at sometimes later this changed to become Nike's when the promotional product placement contract changed hands.\n\nDuring the first season of the show, all players wore red shirts, but due to a new TV game show on Nickelodeon (called Finders Keepers) in the second year, Double Dare changed their shirts so that each team wore different-colored shirts to designate the two different teams for the host to respond to so confusion didn't constantly happen.\n\n, While watching, you'll see that during both Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, teams were composed of two kid players. When this series became Family Double Dare and was revived in 2000 (for Double Dare 2000), these teams held four players each (Family Double Dare generally contained a mother, a father and two kids who all interacted intelligently for each team.), Look for what the contestant desks looked like, along with the score-board for the team and what the stage looked like where the Physical Challenges were played.\n\nAlthough the contestant desks stood on a podium that was long enough for both players from the team to stand behind, there would be a towel rack on the left side of the desk (when watching, you'd see the towels on camera on this towel rack).\nAbove the player podium, would be the players scoreboard. This scoreboard would not in any way be attached to the desks. Depending on the team colors, they would designate in digital form the numbers to the amount of money or points the team would accumulate. Each of these scoreboards would have rounded corners (on the earlier episodes these were tall triangular boards that contained a line of digital numbers for the score along with the program icon below it) and each portion of the backdrop of each number would be set on a black background.\nIn between the two teams would be the host's desk that looked a bit like the contestant's desk but was meant to fit just the host. It had the picturesque icon of the Double Dare name (interconnected D's (DD)) on a plaque (placard) at the center-most portion of the host-desk. Above (in back of) the host of the show, there would be a revolving time clock. From the \"waiting position\" containing the interconnected DD insignia, the time clock would revolve counterclockwise around when a physical challenge was needed revolved back clockwise at the end of the stunt.\nThe floor in front of the team's desks would be where the Physical challenges would be held. The floor always seemed to be spotless before a Physical Challenge was held. Depending on the wetness of the challenge, it was the stage crew's responsibility for cleaning it up while not showing themselves on camera (more on that in a minute, as there is at least one popular name that will come to mind in the fan of this show). The floor was this blue checkerboard with crisscrossing lines of greyish yellow, that was fairly large (about a quarter of the width of a given football field)\nIn between the Physical challenge area and Obstacle Course, the fan would sometimes see two steps where contestants could walk down (when the camera wasn't turned on them) to get to the Obstacle course. However, these steps would never be used in any challenge, but were visible in some camera shots during the Obstacle course run. (These steps were less visible during the Double Dare 2000 taping, but were still present)\nIn front of the Physical Challenge area would be a large area wider than the Physical Challenge area that held the Obstacle Course. It contained eight obstacles on the floor. In back of this and to each of the sides you'd generally see the viewer seating to watch as the episodes were taped. Also, you'd see in between the Obstacle Course and the home-viewer seating all the cameras and equipment that would make for a fantastic production number.\nViewers who chose to take a studio tour during this time and\/or go in for a taping would notice what was happening in the hallway nearby. The hallway in back of the show area contained several other obstacles that weren't being used in that day's taping, but could be used on other episodes.\n\n, Although Marc Summers was the starred host of this show for most of the series' run (from the creation of this show in 1986 till 1993), this show was shot with him as being the host from Double Dare to Super Sloppy Double Dare till Family Double Dare and concluding in 1993. However, when Double Dare was revived in 2000, another host came up onstage instead; This host's name was the little-known Jason Harris who did little along the lines of other gameshows that were set for TV. While Marc Summers had a few other TV shows he was responsible for, following his taping on Double Dare (\"What Would You Do?\"), it was Double Dare that really brought Marc the fame and glory for the great name on his resume. (Marc Summers later hosted the documentary of how certain packaged food products are prepared on the Food Network show \"Unwrapped\".Double Dare 2000 had some of the same rules but it had several additional challenges and some changes to the Obstacle Course.\n\n, Although the name of this article says some of it, Nickelodeon brought the viewer these games, during a programming block between 4 and 5 pm (Eastern Time). It shot and aired over 592 episodes (525 of which aired as either Double Dare (10\/6\/1986 - 2\/19\/1988), Super Sloppy Double Dare (10\/6\/1986 - 2\/19\/1988, daily) or Family Double Dare (8\/13\/1990 - 2\/6\/1993)). These aired between 1986 and 1993 as was stated before. Each of these episodes generally ran anywhere between 21 and 24 minutes (though some aired no longer than 26 minutes long, but tallying with advertisements, all episodes fit neatly into the 30 minute time block that was allotted per show. Although there were some shows (Super Sloppy Double Dare) that ran daily, each show ran only on Saturday nights on Nickelodeon. for Double Dare, Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000. (Double Dare 2000 aired between 1\/22\/2000 and 11\/10\/2000.), During a production or in the final presentation of the episode to the TV viewer, when the host mentioned the names Robin (it was rather common to hear this name on-screen), recognize that Robin Marella and Dave Shikiar (1986-1990) or even Jamie Bojanowski and Chris Mileswere all just stagehands that helped in preparation of the show and during cleanup of the production stage between the toss-up question and physical challenges, all without being seen on camera (down on their knees with off-white colored towels). Robin sometimes brought out the stage props for Physical Challenges., Although all fans of Double Dare recognize the narrators, fans should recognize three names. There was one who went by just his first name upon the program (he was called Harvey) taping, there would sometimes be heard other names of other narrators that would help out on other shows. When Family Double Dare came to air, the name \"Doc Holliday\" showed up as the narrator instead on some episodes of 1992 and all episodes of the 1993 airings. When Double Dare was revived for Double Dare 2000, Tiffany Phillips replaced them all and became the new narrator\/announcer.\n\nHarvey would sometimes be seen on camera when Super Sloppy Double Dare was being taped and aired. But this wasn't normal to see his face present.\n\n, Although the concepts remained the same when the show was brought over from Nickelodeon to the FOX Family Channel in the 1990s, the hosts differed along with the sets and overall end game and even point values\/money changed in how things were set up.\n\nCBS also had a game show that they called Double Dare that was hosted by a very young Alex Trebek. But it had a completely different set of rules and end result for the game along with almost everything else during the game and should never be compared to the Nickelodeon game show. (These episodes air in syndication on BUZZR, and these don't generally make it much to YouTube.).\n\n, This game theme music was called \"On Your Mark\" and any fan of this show will remember it from memory, though Double Dare 2000 had a revised edition of this song used during it's run.\n\nAlso, recognize the short musical segue between the time the end of the host introducing the obstacle in the Obstacle Course and when the prize was shown.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":737}
{"text":" Try to stay within this estimated budget. Then, once you\u2019ve spent a semester or two actually homeschooling your child, revisit your original budget estimates and figure out how much you\u2019ll actually need to spend on classes and materials, and how much money you can earn while still effectively educating your child at home. Use the actual data on your costs and earnings over the course of your first semester or two to allocate future money for classroom materials, textbooks, and so on.\n\n\nBooks, pencils, and other school materials can add up quickly. Deciding on your maximum expenditure will help you manage these costs and buy cautiously when building your child\u2019s curriculum.\nDon\u2019t feel locked in to your budget. You should use it as a guide, but don\u2019t worry if you go slightly over the budget.\nYou might find your budget varies from year to year.\nFree or discounted materials for younger children tend to be easier to obtain than those for older children.\nReevaluate your budget at the beginning of each school year to ensure your budget is realistic relative to your child\u2019s needs and your finances.;\n, For instance, if your child and another are close in age and learning ability, you could teach them one subject, while the other parent could teach them another subject. That way, each of you will only need to invest in one set of learning materials, but your kids will have access to two different classes.\n\n\nWork together with the other parent to develop a curriculum in each class that you\u2019re both happy with.\nThis approach will also save you time, since you won\u2019t have to prepare for the class that the other parent is teaching.\nSharing classes can help you cut down on your budget.\n\n, Alternately, you could just (at discounted rates) buy secondhand materials from other members.\n\n\nFor instance, if your child is in the third grade, they will not need materials from their second-grade curriculum. Try to find a parent who is looking for materials for their second-grader and sell them to that parent.\nThen, locate a parent in the network whose child is a bit older and no longer has use for third-grade materials. Obtain these materials through purchase or trade.\nBy obtaining all or many of the materials necessary for a certain grade level at once, you can save time.\nYou can often get flashcards, books, DVDs, and learning software for free or at discounted rates from parents who no longer have use for them.\nSharing class materials will help you keep your educational costs low.\n\n, All you need is a marker and some notecards. Write the appropriate information on each side and you\u2019ll have your very own set of educational flashcards. This will help you slash your budget for learning materials.\n\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re making flashcards for a German course, write English words on one side of the card and the German translation for each word on the opposite side. Your child can use these to study.\n\n, Junk mail is often a prime candidate for reuse in a homeschool setting. Reusing paper is not only thrifty, but eco-friendly as well.\n\n\nIf possible, get unused paper with printing on just one side from friends and neighbors, too.\n\n, These sales often offer steep discounts on notebooks, pencils, pens, and other school materials. Look for coupons that can help you score even bigger discounts at the checkout line. Getting materials on sale will help you figure out how much money your materials budget really needs.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re really patient, you can sometimes get even better deals once the school year has gotten underway. Stores will try to liquidate their surpluses by offering their school supplies at discount rates.\nCheck dollar stores, office supply stores, and pharmacies for discounts on these materials.\nGetting school materials on sale is an easy way to cut back on your overall budget.\n\n, Homeschooling often means that one parent sacrifices their career in order to homeschool their child. However, if you are that parent, you don\u2019t necessarily need to be entirely unemployed. If you can get a job where you can work from home, you\u2019ll still be able to provide instruction to your child and make yourself available to them if they have questions. Good employment options for a parent who homeschools include:\n\n\ngraphic designer\nwriter\nartist\nmusician\n\n, Many parents choose to send their kids to public schools to participate in classes with expensive materials, or classes that are best learned through interaction with other students. For instance, you might choose to send your child to public school to take, art, drama, and debate classes. Sending your child to public school for certain classes can help you cut down on your overall budget.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":738}

{"text":" This does not mean being unrealistic, or saying you're going to go professional within a year. Instead, you should take a look at what you are, and figure out where you think you would like to be. Give yourself a suitable amount of time to achieve that goal, and break it down into smaller parts if the goal is especially big.;\n, Being good at sports means more than physical strength and speed. In order to be truly great, you need to apply that positive attitude to the way you treat other players, even if they're on the other team. If you lose a match, accept the loss and show respect to the other player for their victory.If you set an example of good sportsmanship, you'll receive the same respect in turn when you win.\n\n, No matter what you do, skills are often slow to build. There is always going to be someone who can do it better than you, at least at first. Impatient athletes tend to make poor ones. If you're not patient, you will try to leap into more advanced techniques long before you're ready. Your motivation will sap away when you don't see improvement immediately. Keep the long-term goal in mind, and hang tight in the meantime while you make it a reality.\n\n, When you play sports, you will inevitably receive criticism. Whether from a coach, other players, or spectators, you need to take most of it with a grain of salt. Are they angry because you missed a pass, or do they sincerely want to help you improve? Learn to distinguish the constructive criticism from the hurtful remarks. In a lot of cases, you can use criticism as motivation to get better in whatever area they bring up.\n\n\nDon't let yourself get defensive.Your thinking becomes more limited if you allow yourself to become emotional against criticism.\n\n, One of the biggest reasons people join sports teams in the first place is to make friends with new people.If you join a team, you're bound to run into a lot of people. Chances are you'll develop friendships with at least some of them. Making these friendships a priority is a good move if you want to become great at sports. You can practice together on your own time. The morale boost of playing with friends helps as well.\n\n\nTeam sports like soccer can have some skills practiced in solitude, but for others (like goalkeeping and passing) another person is needed. It's helpful to have this other person as a friend. It'll make the practice process more enjoyable in the long term.\n\n, It's possible to get so obsessed with being good at something that you lose track of why you want to be good in the first place. Not taking the time to enjoy the sport you play results in a fast burnout. Whether you're practicing or playing a competition, try to remember the other reasons why you play sports. This may include the natural satisfaction you get from exercise, or quality time spent with friends., If you want to become a sports superstar, joining a team is a good way to start. Even if your skills are currently low, joining an amateur league will sharpen up your skills. Sports teams are everywhere, and most of them are free to join. If you go to school, you should go for team tryouts when they're happening. Recreation centres are often host to sports teams as well.If you're not in school, you can find or start a sports club online., Great coaches come in all shapes and sizes.Certain coaching personalities will suit you better than others. The best scenario is having a coach who genuinely wants to see you succeed. In the early stages, enthusiasm is often more helpful than scientific know-how.\n\n\nAcross the board, communication skills are the most important trait a coach can have.There are different levels of sports coach. Most after-school coaches are volunteers with a working knowledge of the sport and enthusiasm for the game. You can hire a sports coach with full training and education, although it will set you back a lot of money., If you want to be truly great at sports, it's not enough to focus on a couple of sports alone. It is important to set your sights wide with your exercises. Don't specialize in skills unless you're already a great athlete. Find ways to train every part of your body. Whether this means playing multiple sports or doing an all-encompassing exercise routine, training your entire body will boost your sports performance.\n\n\nThere's a lot of evidence to suggest that athletes are better if they play more than one sport., it's a common misgiving for young athletes to want to jump into the advanced stuff quickly. This isn't an effective way to spend training time. You need a solid bedrock foundation before you move on to bigger things.If you're new to a sport, take as much time as you need to get the basic movements down properly. It will make advanced skills a lot easier to grasp in the long run.\n\n\nSome argue that fundamental \"movement skills\" (such as jumping and kicking) should be mastered properly before moving on to applied sports skills., In an actual competition, things aren't usually going to play exactly by the books. While you're practicing, you'll usually be playing under optimal circumstances. In order to make sure you'll be up for the unforeseen challenges, you need to predict the conditions of the competition.Ask yourself if you are learning a skill, or if you're learning to actually use that skill in the competitions you'll be in.\n\n\nRemember this motto: \"Train the way you want to play.\"There's no way to perfectly replicate a competition in practice, but playing with other people can get you used to the scenarios you'll need to beware of.\n\n, It is common for bodies to adapt to a level of strain. Progress will slow down if you don't keep upping the stakes as you go along. Bodybuilders and strength-oriented athletes do this by increasing their reps or the weights they work with. As a competition athlete, the best thing you can do to keep progress going is to practice the skills while under fatigue.Studies have shown that skill execution goes out the window when you get tired, so it's a good idea to practice under those conditions.\n\n\nBuilding up your speed is important too. Speed usually comes with practice, but you shouldn't try to rush into speed until you have the basics down pat., If you're wondering at what point a skill becomes mastered, it is when you're able to do it automatically and without thinking. This is called the autonomous phase, and it's where you want to be at if you want to play sports competitively.Given enough time and repetition, a skill will eventually fall under this category. When you're in the fray of a game, you won't have time to think everything through, so practice until it's all automatic, so you'll know you're ready.\n\n\nWhen you're playing a sport like football in a competition, you're going to potentially need to throw a ball while getting chased by several competitors. You can't replicate this stress in private practice, so you have to make sure your tosses perfected beforehand.\nKeep practicing. Practice is never something that should stop. even if you become great at sports, you can always become better. If you stop practicing, chances are that someone more determined will beat you.\n\n, The best athletes know that training doesn't stop at sports skills. You want your body to be as sharp as it can be for whatever sport you're playing. On the downtime away from sports, keep your body in general shape by going to the gym. Although it may seem daunting or expensive, it is absolutely worth the investment if you want to be good at sports. There are lots of benefits to going to a gym. As you'll know from playing in sports teams, exercising with others is very motivating.Do some research into a prospective gym before you pay for a membership. Go for a tour, and ask for details. Make sure the gym fits the circumstances of your life before you make your first payment., This is especially true during times of intense practice or training, where things get so busy it becomes hard to cram everything into a regular day. Nonetheless, your body needs its full rest. At least 6 hours is good, but 8 will ensure your body's had its full time to regenerate.\n\n, Everyone should make a point of eating a diet that benefits their body. This is especially true if you want to be great at sports. Eating junk food will work against whatever efforts you make n the gym. Base your diet on leafy greens and legumes.Cut back on \"empty calories\" (like soda) and replace them with things that improve your health.\n\n\nIf you're lactose intolerant, try going without dairy. It may sound hard, but you'll see benefits within a month.\n\n, As a general rule, the more you drink it, the better you'll feel. Water regulates everything, and you should expect to lose some of your natural hydration via sweat while you exercise. The common \"8 glasses a day\" guideline isn't mandatory, but you should try to keep water next to you whenever you can. It's especially important to stock up on water while you're exercising.\n\n\nKeep a refillable bottle of water around with you. Refill it when it goes empty. You'll find your water consumption goes up a lot if you simply keep it near you.\n\n, Drugs and alcohol aren't recommended if you want to be great at sports. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it drains your body of hydration.Your body will expend resources trying to get rid of the alcohol, and it can have a negative impact on your sports performance for days after the fact.\n\n\nIn the long run, the amount of calories you digest from alcohol like cider and beer can have a negative impact on your gut., The competition will be stiff enough, so it's not worth it losing your edge just because you weren't willing to sleep at least 8 hours.\n\n, While it wouldn't be regularly recommended in a diet, athletes should load up on their carbohydrate intake.Carbs essentially give your body energy, and you'll need lots of energy if you're playing a sports competition.\n\n\nStay away from sugar for a few hours before a big competition. Sugar and starches dehydrate your body. That is something you want to avoid in the midst of competing.Keep yourself up to pace with snacks.Longer matches will be a test of endurance, and something as simple as an energy bar can mean a big difference.\n\n, Warm ups are important for any physically strenuous activity. They can be fairly light, but a proper warm up will help prevent early exhaustion and injury. Aim to warm up around half an hour before the start of the game.Stretch out your arms and legs. Run in place. Work up a bit of a sweat. This will get your body in the right mode for the competition.\n\n\nWarm ups also help fight off anxiety. Pre-game anxiety can be an issue for some players, so you should keep that in mind if it's something you suffer from.\n\n, Having a good idea what to expect with the opposing side is important, regardless whether you're going one on one or playing as a team. If you want to know which techniques you should be using in the midst of certain competitors, it's a good idea to study their methods in the days and weeks before a big game. If there is any footage of those players during a game, give it a shot.\n\n\nThe science of analytics turns the respective skills of your teammates and competitors into a sharp formula.Matching each player to their best strengths is integral to a team's success. Professional sports analysts make it their specific business to analyze the sporting behaviour of athletes.\n\n, Life is always complicated, and there may be things in your personal life that are bothering you. However, at least for the course of the game, you can't let any of that stuff get to you. It may be easier said than done, but if winning the game means enough to you, it should be a straightforward matter to keep your eyes on the prize.\n\n, A lot of the best athletes may have had a natural aptitude for it, but the reason they ultimately succeed is because they want victory more than any of the competition. That's a tricky thing to develop inside yourself, but if the desire is intense enough, you will do just about anything to make your dreams a reality. This broadly applies to the mindset of training, but it's incredibly important during a competition. How much you want to win will have an effect on how far you end up pushing yourself. Sometimes, the distance between winning and losing is very small. A world of difference is made from that added bit of effort. Passion is the key to most kinds of success, and the same applies to sports.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":741}

{"text":" When you first wake up in the morning, your legs have been slightly elevated or at least horizontal. As a result, your legs are likely not as swollen as they might be later in the day. This will make it easier to put on compression stockings.Try elevating your legs while you sleep by resting your feet on a pillow. You can also slightly tilt the foot of your mattress upward by putting a 2x4 piece of wood underneath the mattress end.;\n, If your legs have any moisture on them, you might not be able to pull up the compression stockings. Sprinkle talcum powder or cornstarch on your feet and calves to absorb any excess moisture., One of the easiest ways to put on compression stockings is to turn the top part of the sock inside out. You\u2019ll want to leave the toe of the sock right side out. Reach into the stocking and grip onto the toe., Pinch the toe so that it stays right side out while pulling the top of the stocking down over your arm. This will result in the top being inside out.\n\n, Carefully slide the stocking off your arm so that the top remains inside out while the toe is ready for your foot.\n\n, Putting on compression stockings can be difficult, especially if you have trouble reaching your feet. Try sitting down on a chair or on the side of the bed so that you can bend down to reach your feet.\n\n, Wearing gloves will make it easier to grip onto the stockings and pull them up. Choose latex gloves such as those worn by healthcare professionals, or similar type gloves. Dishwashing gloves will also work., Slide your toes into the end of the sock and align the sock so that the toe of the sock is even and straight.\n\n, As your toe holds the bottom of the sock in place, pull the bottom of your sock over your heel so that your entire foot is inside the sock.\n\n, Use your palms to draw the stocking up and over your calf. The inside-out top part of the sock will roll upward to be right-side out. Your gloved hands will be able to grip the sock better than a bare hand.\n\n\nDo not pull at the top of the sock to get it up your leg. This will likely rip the sock.\n\n, Make sure to keep the sock straight and smooth while you bring it over your calf. Smooth out any wrinkles as you go.\n\n\nIf you are wearing knee-high compression stockings, they should come up to a point 2 finger widths below your knee.Some compression stockings go up to the top of the thigh.\n\n, If your doctor has prescribed compression stockings for both legs, follow these instructions to put the sock on your other foot. Try to have the stockings come up to the same point on both legs.\n\n\nSome prescriptions may only require a compression stocking for one leg., If your doctor recommends that you wear compression stockings to improve blood flow, then it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to wear them every day. Otherwise, it can be difficult to get them on your feet.Take off your compression stockings when you go to bed every night.\n\n, If you have trouble reaching your feet or putting on your compression stockings, you might benefit from using a sock aid. This is a device or frame that resembles a foot shape. Put the sock over the device and slide your foot into the device. Then remove the device and your sock will be properly placed on your foot., If you are having trouble putting on your compression stockings because your feet or legs are swollen, try elevating your feet above your heart for 10 minutes. Lie down on your bed with your feet resting on a pillow, Before you go to bed, remove your compression stockings. This will give your legs a rest and will also give you a chance to wash your stockings.\n\n, Gently pull down at the top of the sock with two hands. This will pull the sock down your calf so that the sock is inside out again. Remove the stocking from your foot., If you are having trouble getting the stockings off your ankles or feet, especially if you can\u2019t reach your feet very well, try using a medical dressing stick to grip onto the compression sock and push it off your foot. This does require some arm strength, which can be difficult for some people., Hand wash your stockings with laundry soap and warm water. Wring out excess water by rolling your stockings in a towel. Hang them up to dry.Try to get at least two pairs of compression stockings, so you can have one pair to wear while the other is being laundered.\n\n, Leg pain and\/or swelling can be uncomfortable to live with, and compression stockings might make your legs feel better. Talk with your doctor to see if this option will reduce your discomfort.If you have poor blood flow in your legs, compression stockings are not the right choice.\n\n, Your doctor will check to see if you have varicose veins, venous leg ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in a deep vein), or lymphedema (leg swelling). If one of these conditions is present, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings for you.\n\n\nYou may need to wear compression stockings daily for up to two years., Almost one-third of pregnant women will develop varicose veins,which are veins typically in the legs and feet that have enlarged because of increased pressure in your veins.Wearing compression stockings can make your legs more comfortable and will promote blood circulation.\n\n\nAsk your doctor if compression stockings will help your condition.\n\n, In some cases, compression stockings will be prescribed for patients post-surgery to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), or the formation of blood clots in your veins. If your post-surgery recovery restricts your mobility or requires extended bed rest, your doctor may prescribe compression stockings., While research about the health benefits of wearing compression stockings during exercise is mixed, recovery time after exercising is decreased as blood flow is improved.Many runners and other athletes now wear compression stockings either during exercise or afterwards. It is up to you whether you find them comfortable enough to wear.\n\n\nThese are usually sold as compression socks, and are available at sporting goods stores and other athletic supply stores.\n\n, The compression in the stockings is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).Your doctor will give you the proper pressure grade of stockings so that you are getting the proper treatment.\n\n, Compression stockings are available in varying lengths, including knee-high and ones that reach the top of the thigh. Ask your doctor which length you need.\n\n, Your legs will need to be measured so that you know the proper size of compression stockings to get. Your doctor may measure your legs; if not, a clerk at a medical equipment supply store should be able to help you., Locate your local medical equipment shop and verify that they carry compression stockings.\n\n\nCompression stockings are also available through some online retailers. It is preferable to visit a professional to get fitted for the proper compression stockings, but if this is not an option, try shopping online for stockings.\n\n, Some health insurance plans will cover compression stockings.You will likely need a doctor\u2019s prescription for these stockings to be covered.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":744}
{"text":" Many people have this idea of \u201cthe one\u201d as being this perfect, god-like person who will solve all of your problems and make every day of your life a fairy tale. However, the real way to know if you\u2019re with \u201cthe one\u201d is to see that you\u2019re with a person you love whose flaws you are able to accept. If you\u2019re able to deal with the loud belching, the bad taste in music, or the messiness of the man you\u2019re with instead of cringing every time he does something you deem imperfect, then he\u2019s the one.\n\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t talk about having him change some of his flaws, like learning to clean up better. But if he\u2019s not the one, then you probably can\u2019t stand his imperfections.;\n, If you\u2019re with the one, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be feeling butterflies 24\/7, contrary to what you may think. However, if he\u2019s really not the one for you, then you won\u2019t feel a thing when you get ready to meet him or come home to him. You should feel a sense of excitement and expectation when you\u2019re about to see him or spend time with him if he\u2019s the one.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel any kind of joy about seeing him, then you may be looking at him more as a friend, or may just have gotten bored with him.\nThe next time you get ready to see him, ask yourself how excited you are. Does your heart race a little? Have you been looking forward to it all day? You don\u2019t have to be over-the-moon happy every single time you hang out, but it should be something you look forward to for sure.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then you should already be thinking about living the rest of your life with him, whether this means getting married, having kids, and all the traditional things, or if it means being life partners and exploring life together. If you look forward a few years, or even think about what you\u2019ll be doing next summer, and can\u2019t imagine him being by your side, then you know he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nAnother sign that he\u2019s not the one is that he\u2019s never mentioned a future with you in it. If he gets nervous or changes the subject every time you bring up the future, then it\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s not serious about you.\nTry to imagine your life in ten years, as crazy as that may sound. Does it seem impossible to picture him by your side, or not by your side? If you absolutely can\u2019t see it, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then you should feel like you\u2019re able to be yourself around him, instead of having to dress up or fit a certain role in his life. You should be able to look like yourself, talk like yourself, and express your views without worrying that you\u2019ll upset or disappoint him. Though you can feel a little bit nervous just because you like him, you know he\u2019s not the one if you\u2019re constantly stressed out, anxious, or worrying about how he feels about you.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re constantly worried that something you say will upset him or set him off, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then you should feel comfortable telling him the truth, whether this means where you\u2019ve been or what your worries about the relationship are. You shouldn\u2019t feel like every little thing you tell him will make him angry, jealous, moody, or just reserved. If he really cares for you, then you should feel like you can tell him anything without making you feel afraid or anxious. If he makes you feel scared every time you want to tell him what\u2019s really on your mind, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nIf you feel like you have to lie to protect him or to keep him from getting angry, then he\u2019s not the one.\nIf you feel like you can open up to him about your doubts and that he will listen and take you seriously, then he may be the one.\n\n, You can sit down with your best friends and family members and you can go down a million checklists about whether or not he\u2019s the one, but in the end, you\u2019re the only person who can figure this one out. It can be helpful to turn to sources like wikiHow for advice, but at the end of the day, you\u2019ll be the only person to know if the guy is not the one, no matter what anyone else says.\n\n\nRemember that what is perfect for your best friend or favorite aunt may not be great for you; people can help you, but they can\u2019t make the decision for you because you\u2019re different people with different needs.\nHowever, one sign that he may not be the one is that you\u2019re on this page. If you\u2019re already having your doubts about whether or not he\u2019s the one, then you may have a problem.\nAs corny as it sounds, you\u2019ll know whether or not he\u2019s the one in your gut. It\u2019s an intuitive feeling that you sometimes can\u2019t explain. There may be a chance that you already know he\u2019s wrong for you in your gut, but are looking for confirmation.\n\n, Everyone flirts a little bit here and there, and if you flirt every once in a while in a harmless way, it\u2019s not the end of the world. However, if your man is constantly flirting with other girls, talking about other girls, and disrespecting you by checking other girls out, then he\u2019s just not the one. You can\u2019t make excuses for him and can\u2019t convince yourself that he doesn\u2019t mean anything by it; if he really cared about you, then he would never show this type of behavior.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that if he cheats on you, then he\u2019s not the one. It\u2019s one thing if he cheated once and deeply regretted it and you\u2019re working to forgive him and another if he\u2019s a serial cheater. If he repeatedly cheats on you, then the sooner you get out, the better.\nEven if he doesn\u2019t cheat on you and it doesn\u2019t go past flirting, the fact that he would do it in front of you or in front of your friends is a sign of major disrespect.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then he should be proud to show you off, to hold your hand or have his arm around you in public, and to spend time with you when he\u2019s also with his friends or family. If he always makes up excuses about hanging out in public or having you meet his friends, then he\u2019s not looking for a serious relationship. If he\u2019s eager to hang out in your bedroom but won\u2019t go to the movies with you, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nDon\u2019t make excuses for him or think he\u2019s really busy when he doesn\u2019t want to go out with you. If he really cared, he\u2019d make the effort.\nIf you\u2019ve been seeing each other for a long time and he\u2019s never mentioned going out and meeting his friends, then he doesn\u2019t take you seriously.\n\n, Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that you should make him change who he is, but that, if there\u2019s certain behavior you\u2019d like him to change, such as flirting with other girls or not calling you back, that he should be willing to do that for you. If he\u2019s stubborn and absolutely refuses to change in ways that would make him a more caring, considerate boyfriend, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not easy for a man to change, but he should at least be open to a conversation about it. If he gets angry if you even mention something you\u2019d like him to change, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then he should respect your love for running, your hard work in nursing school, or all the time you spend writing songs. He doesn\u2019t have to participate in all of these hobbies, but he should ask you about them and be impressed that you\u2019re putting in the effort and that you care so much. If he\u2019s the one, then he should be appreciative of the person who you are and the person you want to be.\n\n\nIf he puts down your hobbies and makes you feel like they\u2019re not important, then he\u2019s not the one.\nIf he puts down your goals and makes you feel like you can\u2019t achieve them, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, This is one of the most important signs that he\u2019s just not the one. If he can\u2019t go an hour without lying to you and you find yourself constantly catching him in a lie, then he\u2019s not the one. If he lies about everything from where he\u2019s been to what he had for lunch, then it\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s keeping secrets from you and that he can\u2019t be trusted. If he lies to you, then he\u2019s just not the one.\n\n\nIf you have evidence that he\u2019s been lying and he denies it when you call him out on it, then that\u2019s a red flag, too.\nIf he respects you, then he should give you his honesty instead of making you look like a fool. Think about it. If he was really the one, would he feel the need to be dishonest?\n\n, If he\u2019s really the one, then he\u2019ll be there for you when the going gets tough just as much as he would when you were having the time of your life. If he\u2019s there for the parties and the fun road trips and falls off the radar the second your grandmother gets sick, then there\u2019s no excuse for it\u2014he\u2019s just not the one. True love means being with a person through the good times and the bad, and if he flees the scene every time you\u2019re struggling, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nSure, he may be the perfect gentleman when you\u2019re on a fun date or just chatting over the phone. But if he has nothing to say or has to go when you\u2019re having a family crisis or lost your job, then he\u2019s not the one. You can find someone who will be there for the hardship, too.\n\n, If your man is abusive, then there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it\u2014you have to get out of the relationship, and fast. There is no making excuses like, \u201cHe\u2019ll never do it again\u201d or \u201cHe really loves me, he just has a lot of problems,\u201d when it comes to physical or emotional abusive. If he puts a hand on you and hurts you, then he is definitely not the one, and you should get out of the relationship as soon as you can.\n\n\nNobody said it was easy to leave a man who is abusive, especially if you\u2019re afraid of leaving him. However, you need to talk to your friends and family and get some help in leaving him as soon as you can and as safely as possible.\n\n, If he\u2019s the one, then you should come to think of him as your best friend, as the person that you can tell anything and the one you feel the most comfortable opening up to. If this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, then you should feel this way. Of course, if you have many close friends, then it can take a while to get here, but this is the feeling you have about him.\n\n\nIf you feel like he\u2019s your romantic partner but like you can\u2019t really open up to him, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, Everyone has communication problems, but if you feel like you and the guy can barely talk to each other without fighting or misunderstanding each other, then he\u2019s not the one. If he gets angry every time you try to have a serious conversation, then he\u2019s not the one, because he\u2019s not willing to have an open, honest relationship with you.\n\n\nIf you avoid bringing up serious topics or things that are bothering you because you know he won\u2019t do anything about it, then he\u2019s not the one.\nIf you feel like he barely listens to you or even looks at you when you try to tell him something important, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, You may not think this a big deal when you first start dating each other, but once you\u2019ve been together for a long time, it\u2019s important that your man gets along with your friends and family. These are the closest people to you and they share at least some of your values, and if he can\u2019t get along with a single one of them and doesn\u2019t even try, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nOf course, it may not be possible for him to get on with your friends and family 100%, and there may be a few people he just can\u2019t click with. You may also have a particularly difficult family to please, and that\u2019s fine. The most important thing is that he makes an effort\u2014if he doesn\u2019t get along with the people you care about and seems fine with it, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n, The best part about being in a meaningful relationship with your soul mate is that you really do complete each other in some way and make each other feel better when you\u2019re together. Your man should make you feel like a better person and should encourage you to grow and reach your potential. If you feel like he puts you down and makes you worse instead of better, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nThink about how you\u2019ve changed since meeting him. Have you become more driven, more motivated, or just a happier person, or have you started feeling more down on yourself and less capable of fulfilling your potential? If he\u2019s slowed you down, then he\u2019s not the one.\nOf course, it\u2019s important that you encourage him to be better, too.\n\n, If you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, then you have to make sure you see eye to eye on a lot of things. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to share the same religion or the same political affiliation, and there\u2019s something to be said for opposites attracting, but if you feel like his take on the world is so different from yours that you can\u2019t see eye to eye on a single thing, then he\u2019s not the one.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a true optimist and he is always complaining and bringing you down and can\u2019t find something to be happy about, then he can still be the one, but you have to ask yourself if this is something you\u2019re willing to take for the rest of your life.\nIf you believe in charity and helping others, while he thinks it\u2019s a waste of time, then you have to think about how important this is to you.\nThough political affiliation alone isn\u2019t a reason for a break-up, if being a liberal is very important to you and is a big part of who you are, then you may need to ask yourself if you want to spend the rest of your life who is opposed to so many of your ideas.\n\n, This is the bottom line. If he\u2019s the one, then he should love and appreciate the person who you are. He shouldn\u2019t tell you he wishes you were skinnier, dressed more sexy, talked less, or stopped doing the things you care about. Though you can work on growing together and addressing your mutual flaws, he should like who you are at your core and should encourage you to be the person you want to be instead of trying to change you.\n\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t really get you, criticizes you for having opinions or wanting things that are different from what he wants, then he\u2019s just not the one.\nIf you find yourself trying to change just to please him, then he\u2019s not the one.\nIf he doesn\u2019t give you the basic respect you deserve, then he is not the one.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":745}

Very similar to seasoning hamburgers or any other types of meat. Keep rolling the ingredients and press the meat lightly together as it\u2019s sometimes difficult to mix these ingredients into your lamb or beef.

Be reminded this is only one method., Take about four patties of meat, or however many your pan will contain, and begin to pan fry the patties.,, However, if its turning black or smoking, or smells like its burning, you are obviously running the meat and need to lower the heat of the oven or add more oil for moisture.,, Let cool, but serve while its still hot. Often kibbeh is served with plan yogurt, or homemade style yogurt that dates back centuries., Often the hardest part is gathering all the materials together. Be reminded that appearance is not essential for this kind of food, granted you do not want to look unappetizing or spoiled, but taste is much more important. Be patient when cooking these foods, and take your time. Perhaps try making each dish separately before taking the ambition to cook all four recipes all at once. Or make it an evening affair and invite your friends over to try something new. But, once you are accustomed to the routine and demand of cooking and baking Lebanese cuisine, you will have no problems adjusting to other styles of Mediterranean foods and become eager to know more.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":746}

{"text":" Some symptoms of a concussion can occur immediately after your injury, such as losing consciousness (\u201cblacking out\u201d), nausea, headache or a feeling of pressure in the head, dizziness, confusion, and ringing in the ears.However, sometimes you feel fine immediately after an injury, and symptoms do not begin until hours or even days later. If you hit your head, fall, or jar your head or neck like with whiplash, immediately stop what you\u2019re doing and do not return to activity that day.\n\n\nDo not try to walk or stand immediately after your injury, unless you are in immediate physical danger. Rest seated or lying down until you know you can move without feeling ill.\nAthletes, usually hockey and football players, must be medically evaluated before returning to play.;\n, If you feel weak on one side of your body, are vomiting continuously, are confused or anxious, have neck pain, or are very drowsy, call for immediate medical care. Severe symptoms like these may indicate a more severe brain injury.\n\n\nSomeone may have to call for help for you if you are unable.\nIf you have neck or head pain, do NOT move until help arrives. Injuries that cause concussions can also result in spinal injuries, which can cause permanent damage.\n\n, Even if you had minimal discomfort immediately after your injury, you should get medical help right away if your symptoms worsen in the next few hours or days. You may have a headache that gets worse and worse, begin to feel clumsy or start to stumble, get progressively dizzier, or feel confused or have problems with speech., Unless you had epilepsy before your injury and have frequent seizures, having a seizure after getting a concussion may indicate a serious problem. Don\u2019t wait to get medical attention.Post-traumatic seizures are those that occur one week after the brain injury. Post-traumatic seizures are common in those who suffer from a severe traumatic brain injury, especially those that have an intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n, In general, your pupils (the black centers of your eyes) should be the same size. If one pupil becomes larger than the other, it may indicate a neurological condition. Go to your doctor right away., Even if you did not lose consciousness or experience immediate symptoms, see your doctor after any head injury. They will be able to evaluate you for other injuries that may have occurred, assess the severity of your symptoms, and give you further treatment advice. They may refer you for a CT scan or an MRI so they can rule out other brain injuries.Bring a friend or loved one with you to the appointment to take notes and help you later. You might have trouble concentrating and need reminders.Sometimes your doctor may refer you to other specialists, like a neurologist if you\u2019re having severe symptoms or problems with your nerves, or a chiropractor or physical therapist to help with pain from your car accident, for instance.\n\n, Young children can get concussions, too, but are often unable to tell you how they feel. If a child receives any injury that could cause damage to their head, watch for behavior changes and problems with balance and coordination. Children with a concussion may:Seem dazed, overly tired, or listless.\nBe irritable, cranky, or very tearful.\nLose interest in toys and normal activities.\nAppear off-balance or unsteady when walking or standing.\nExperience changes in sleep and eating habits.\n\n, Before returning to play, recovered child athletes should complete a full-course of non-contact exercise, this should include challenges of gradually increasing intensity., For the first 24 hours after your injury it\u2019s important to have someone stay with you to make sure your symptoms are not getting worse.Your caregiver should be someone who knew you before the injury so that they are familiar with your baseline personality and thinking patterns. If your symptoms worsen at all, your caregiver should take you to the hospital or call for emergency medical assistance.\n\n\nWhile you sleep during those first 24 hours, your caregiver should wake you up every 1-2 hours to check on your symptoms. You should be able to wake up normally. They can ask you what your name is, what state you live in, or what day of the week it is to ensure you aren\u2019t getting confused. Neurological checks every 2 hours is important in the course of treatment and care.\n\n, Despite popular belief, it\u2019s okay to sleep when you have a concussion. You will likely require more sleep than usual as your brain recovers. Sleep is a great way to rest your brain right after your injury as well as throughout the next several weeks, so continue to nap throughout the day if you need to., If possible, take time off of work or school or find childcare so that you can rest for up to two weeks. Rest truly is the only medicine for a concussion, and the more you can rest after your injury the more quickly you will recover. Enlist family, friends or hired help to ease your burden for several weeks.\n\n, You may be very sensitive to sounds and light after a concussion, and will likely be more comfortable keeping still than moving around. Your brain needs rest in order to heal, and this includes rest from stimulus. Lie in a quiet room with closed blinds or a towel over your eyes as much as you can.\n\n\nDo not try to read, text, or watch TV to pass the time. This stimulates your brain. True brain rest requires calm, quiet, stillness, and minimal brain activation.\nAvoid activities that raise your heart rate, like fast walking or lifting weights., No matter what you do, you may have post-concussion symptoms beginning a few days after your injury and lasting up to 2-3 weeks. Some people experience post-concussion symptoms for months. Symptoms may include dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.Some people also develop emotional symptoms like depression, which can last for several weeks to months.\n\n\nOnce a concussion has been sustained, you cannot prevent further symptoms. Rest as much as you can. Be patient and know that this is a normal part of the process.\nHeadaches may not develop until weeks or months after a head injury.\n\n, This can be an uncomfortable and challenging time. In order to focus on your recovery, try to keep your stress to a minimum. Meditate daily and try mindfulness exercises. Do deep breathing techniques. Give yourself a hand massage. Do whatever calming, non-strenuous activities you enjoy.\n\n, If you have a headache, it\u2019s okay to take products like Tylenol that use the ingredient acetaminophen. This may alleviate some discomfort. However, do not take Advil, Motrin, or anything containing ibuprofen or aspirin \u2013 this could increase the risk of bleeding in your brain., If you have any remaining symptoms of concussion whatsoever, do not do anything that may cause further brain injury. Avoid riding a bike, playing sports, going on roller coasters \u2013 anything that may injure or jostle your brain. Second impact syndrome is caused when you get another concussion before the first heals, and it can cause fast and potentially fatal swelling of your brain.The term\u201d second impact syndrome\u201d is used when there is diffuse brain swelling after a second impact to the head.\n\n, Your response time and ability to focus may be impaired after a concussion, which can make driving dangerous.Avoid driving until your symptoms improve. Speak with your doctor about your symptoms and whether it\u2019s safe for you to drive, ride a bike, or use heavy equipment.\n\n, After your initial time of complete rest, return to work, school, and other mental activities slowly. Start with half days, and speak with employers or teachers about having a lighter workload for several weeks as you ease back in to mental work.\n\n\nYour doctor will likely be willing to write a note for you requesting this if they think you need it.\n\n, Do not restart any physical activities or even anything that raises your heart rate until you are free of concussion symptoms and have been checked by your doctor. Then return to playing your sport, riding your bike, or exercising slowly and gradually.It is not uncommon to feel symptoms return when you start to be physical. Let your body be your guide as you increase your activity level. If you start to feel sick, stop your activity for the day and rest. You will gradually build your stamina back up.\nMany sports teams have a post-concussion return-to-play protocol to ease you back in to your sport safely. If not, do not let anyone convince you to play before you\u2019re well. Ask your doctor or a sports therapist for guidelines, and take responsibility for your health.\nAccording to the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, the concern for recurrent concussions has lead to serious consequences such as second impact syndrome and dementia, which has lead to the development of a series of guidelines that address concussion severity and return to play for athletes., It can be frustrating trying to return to your daily life while you are having difficulty concentrating, remembering and thinking. These problems will improve, but in the mean time help yourself by making lists of things you have to remember or writing notes as ideas occur to you. Focus on one task at a time.Consult with loved ones you trust before making any important decisions while your brain is recovering.\n\n, Drinking alcohol or using any drugs that aren\u2019t prescribed to you can delay your recovery. Do not drink alcohol until your doctor tells you that it is safe to do so., Having had a previous concussion is a risk-factor for getting another concussion, and unfortunately the effects of concussions are cumulative over your lifetime. This means that each subsequent concussion is easier to get, and has more severe symptoms than the last. Suffering from multiple concussions can even cause permanent problems after many years. If you\u2019ve had a concussion, consider what activities are safe for you to do.You may need to refrain from contact sports like football, rugby, hockey, and roller derby, in which concussions are common.\nSome people find they can no longer go on roller coasters or handle the loud noise of concerts without feeling unwell.\n\n, Always wear a helmet and protective gear when playing sports or riding a bicycle or motorcycle. Fasten your seatbelt any time you are in a vehicle. Check your home to ensure there is nothing you may trip over, like a loose rug., Some people experience symptoms of a concussion for much longer than others, even months or years. If you have to give up activities that you love, refrain from exercising like you once did, or struggle to be as mentally active as before your injury, you may feel discouraged, isolated or depressed. Find a local support group or join an online community to build solidarity with others who are experiencing similar struggles.\n\n\nIf you feel deeply depressed, anxious, or have thoughts of self-harm, seek professional care.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":748}

{"text":" Eighties alternative rock bands like The Cure are good places to begin. Look at songs besides their singles, and get a feel for the music. When you're ready, move onto less mainstream Gothic bands.;\n, For the most part, the mainstream sounds that you will be used to are gone. The band Bauhaus is considered one of the most well-known and influential goth bands. Other good starting points can be found in punk and post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Siouxsie & the Banshees, The Damned, Sisters of Mercy or Christian Death. Later you may want to try more specific styles of Gothic music.\n\n,, Artists known to play in this style are Jill Tracy, Salon Betty, Rozz Williams, Katzenjammer Kabarett, Voltaire and Rasputina.\n\n,,,,,,,,, A huge part of \"Gothic\" music is appreciation of very meaningful and deep lyrics. You can search online for the lyrics. Listen to what they are singing about. The lyrics vary from deeply touching and profound to perforated with a macabre whimsy.\n\n, This is a cool type of music. It has it's own sound, like all genres.\n\n, Websites such as and Gothic International, they're websites dedicated to informing others about the subculture, including its music.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":751}
{"text":" Include both cardiovascular and strength exercises in your routine. Cardiovascular exercise gets your blood pumping and strength exercises can tone flabby skin associated with age.\n\n\nImproved circulation supplies more nutrients and oxygen to your skin.\nExercise also increases your supply of collagen and fights against damaging free radicals in your body.\nCardiovascular exercise can also lead to weight loss, and shedding a few extra pounds and some excess fat can drop your perceived age by several years.;\n, Stress can create more wrinkles and general wear on your skin. Relaxing more often may not undo the damage already done, but it can prevent your skin from aging any faster than necessary from this point on.\n\n\nA simple trick to try is to laugh more throughout the day. Laugh decreases stress hormones in the body and forces the muscles in your face to relax. If you don't feel like you have anything to laugh about look up jokes on the internet, or watch a funny movie or a comedian.\nOn a similar note, you should also get six to eight hours of sleep each night. Dark, puffy eyes can make you look older, but getting enough sleep can clear those bags away. Keep in mind severe allergies can also cause dark circles, so get your allergies under control by avoiding the things that cause them, or by taking allergy medication (doctor approved, of course). Moreover, sleep reduces the body's production of stress hormone, which is good, because stress hormone can make your skin appear less elastic and less healthy.\n\n, It's a simple trick, but straightening your posture gives the appearance of confidence, and confidence is a trait commonly associated with youth. Walking around with your back straight and your head high can shave a few years off your age in a matter of minutes.\n\n, Use a gentle exfoliating wash on your skin one to three times each week. The process of exfoliation strips away dead skin cells and stimulates the production of new skin cells. As a result, your skin looks clearer, more elastic, and more youthful.\n\n, Age causes skin to dry out, and dry, fine skin is more likely to develop wrinkles. Use a moisturizing cream on your face that is labeled as a face lotion, don't use hand lotion on your face. The reason for this is the hand lotions might be too strong and could cause you to break out. Yes, even we can break out at our age if we use the wrong products! Use hand lotion on your hands that has sunblock in it to help prevent age spots. One trick is to pat your face dry after a shower, and to put the lotion on your face immediately while your skin is still hydrated from the shower. The reason you pat your face is that the more rubbing and pulling you do to your face makes the wrinkles and bags under your eyes happen faster as your skin becomes more fragile and less elastic with age.\n\n\nSimilarly, you should use a moisturizing lip balm to keep the skin on your lips healthy and plump, as well. They also sell lip plumping lipstick and lip gloss.\n\n, UV rays from the sun can damage and age your skin even faster. Prevent this from happening by wearing sunscreen when you go outside. You should also consider wearing sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your skin even further. Sun damage can also cause freckles or skin cancer, so it's best to avoid the sun's rays anyway\n\n\nOn a similar note, you should also avoid the use of tanning beds. The tanning process makes your skin look dry and wrinkled, which will make you look older.\n\n, Smoking wrinkles the skin and turns both your nails and teeth yellow. Quitting the habit will not turn back the clock, but it can at least prevent the clock from speeding forward any faster than it naturally would.\n\n, Your body builds up free radicals over time, and these free radicals can speed up the aging process. Antioxidants battle these free radicals, though, keeping them in check and even reversing some signs of aging in the process.\n\n\nGood sources of antioxidants include berries and other colorful fruit, nuts, dark chocolate, coffee, fruit juice, cooked vegetables, and beans.\n\n, Excess sugar in the body can cause your body to undergo a process called glycation. This process can damage the collagen in your skin. When this happens, your skin becomes less elastic and wrinkles can form more easily.\n\n, A glass of wine every few days should not do too much damage, but consuming alcohol in excess can cause multiple health problems. Taking care of your health is a good way to retain your youth.\n\n, In addition to those foods already mentioned, stock up on foods that can provide you with vitamins and minerals your body needs to repair aged, damaged skin.Eat more zinc-rich oysters. Zinc repairs damaged skin.\nOlive oil and avocados contain good fats that can prevent further wrinkling.\nWater-based produce, like watermelon and cucumbers, keep the skin hydrated.\nGuava is packed with vitamin C and can help restore collagen levels.\nSweet potatoes contain beta-carotene, which can fight against dry skin and improve your cell-turnover rate.\nWomen should also eat more legumes, soy, red clover tea, and ground flaxseeds. All of these are good sources of phytoestrogens, which can fight against drooping skin.\nEat less white rice and white bread, substitute brown rice and whole grain bread.\n\n, For women, one of the more distressing signs of age is the \"turkey neck\"--saggy skin that hangs just below the face. Fashion scarves offer a quick, stylish way to cover up that patch of skin and shave off a few years from your face.\n\n\nChoose a lightweight scarf with a simple design and avoid scarves with unnecessary frills or embellishments. The idea is to cover your neck up without drawing attention to that area of your body.\nAvoid heavy scarves and turtlenecks since they often add too much unflattering bulk to the neck area.\n\n, Gray hair gives away your age. Consult a professional hair stylist and discuss color treatments that can make your hair look more youthful without causing any more damage to it.\n\n\nAvoid home treatments since many of the chemicals found in commercial hair dyes can dry out and damage hair further.\nTypically, your best bet is to choose a shade similar to your natural hair color before gray hair started to appear.\n\n, Talk to your hair stylist about options that may work for you. Keep in mind that as hair ages, it tends to weaken. As a result, longer hair often has less body and looks more unhealthy than shorter hair once you reach your 50s.\n\n\nIf your hair is naturally curly, work with it rather than working against it. Curls can actually look fresher and younger at this age. Moreover, the treatments needed to straighten curly hair may only damage it further.\nConsider adding bangs. Bangs can mask skin imperfections that come with age. Choose long, wispy bangs or sideswept bangs over heavy, straight-cut styles.\nTry getting your hair blown out at a salon. This process can straighten wiry gray hairs while giving the rest of your hair more youthful body.\nConsider getting a softer hairstyle. Harsh hairstyles, such as ramrod straight hair, or an angular cut doesn't usually look good on older women, while a soft hairstyle, with gentle waves softens the face and is generally more attractive. Look at hair magazines for ideas. Can cut out the hairstyles you are interested in to bring into your stylist. Not all hairstyles will look good on you, so take the advice of a hairstylist you trust on what will and won't work.\n\n, You might feel tempted to mask signs of aging by wearing more make-up, but in actuality, wearing fewer cosmetics will actually do more for your appearance.\n\nOpt for sheer lip glosses, lip pencils, and lip stains. Avoid lipsticks with heavy pigmentation. If you have wrinkles on your lips and your lipstick doesn't stay put you might need to use a lip pencil to outline your lips. If you do use a lip pencil be careful it matches your lipstick as close as you can, you don't want the lip pencil to be noticeable.\nChoose a blush that blends into your skin color and apply it higher on the cheekbone, away from the nose, to counteract the natural sagging of skin that comes with age. Use a powder blush, liquid blush is more difficult to apply evenly and doesn't look as natural.\nAvoid products with a shimmer, pearl or sparkle finish.\nLine the eye with eye shadow instead of traditional liner. If your eyelids droop over your eyes then the shadow might transfer, and might not work for you. In that case you might want to try a gel eyeliner that comes with a little brush. You line your eyes as close to the eyelashes as possible and with a thin line, not thick. I suggest charcoal or brown-black, straight black is just too dark. Your eye make-up needs to look softer and less severe overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Older women usually have some hair that grows on your chin as you age. If it is too much trouble to do this on a regular basis you can get the chin hair professionally removed, but that costs more, and it doesn't always work and get all of it., If your eyelashes have thinned out with age, apply false lashes or lash extensions to make your eyes look younger. Natural styles tend to work better since glamorous ones are more likely to look fake.\n\n, Younger people usually have darker eyebrows, and the color fades with age, so if your eyebrows disappear over time, or are faded then pencil them in with an eyebrow pencil with light feathery strokes following your natural eyebrows, you could also use shadow especially made for eyebrows that is sold in any grocery or other similar store, some eyebrow kits actually have eyebrow stencils, to help you with where the eyebrow shadow should go. Don't overdo it, practice, start light at first and darken up. It is much easier to darken your eyebrows than to overdo it and have to wash it off and start over again., Pluck out or wax away eyebrow hairs that have grown too long. You can also pluck out gray eyebrow hair or dye it a shade or two darker than your hair color.\n\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make is to pluck out all of your eyebrows and draw them in artificially with eyebrow pencil, or to get them tattooed on. This technique looks unnatural and will age you further, making you look older instead of younger.\n\n, If you've begun balding, you might be tempted to hide your bald spot by combing your remaining hair over it or by wearing a toupee. Both options are not practical, however, since both are generally very noticeable. Moreover, in your desperation to hide your bald spot, you may actually make yourself look older to those looking at you.\n\n\nA better option is simply to get your hair cut short. Having short hair looks neater and may make your bald spot less noticeable. Moreover, since men of all ages can wear short buzz-cuts, the style itself does not reveal your age.\n\n, If your facial hair is still growing even after the hair on top of your head has fallen out, you could try maintaining a neatly groomed mustache, beard, or combination style.\n\n\nWhile a lack of facial hair may have given you a \"baby face\" when you were younger, maintaining it as you get older can draw the eye away from the top of your head.\nAdditionally, facial hair has a certain ruggedness associated with it. Your body might be wearing down with age, but facial hair can give the opposite impression and make you look as sturdy and strong as ever.\nSometimes the beard gets gray before your hair does, if it bothers you too much you can buy over the counter dye kits made especially to dye beards and mustaches where they sell women's hair dye in grocery stores so you can dye it yourself. Just be sure to follow the directions.\n\n, If you still have plenty of hair but see it turning gray or white, talk to your barber about getting the hair dyed. Aim for a shade close to the natural color you sported in your youth. If your hair has already been gray or white for a long time, you might want to consider going for a salt-and-pepper look, instead, since that could look more natural.\n\n\nTalk to a haircare professional before changing your hair color. Boxed dyes can contain chemicals that may weaken or damage your hair further. If you dye your hair yourself make sure you follow all of the directions for best results.\n\n, The hair in your ears and nose generally grows faster and longer once you reach your 40s and 50s, so untrimmed hair in these areas is both untidy and a clear sign of age. Trim the hair whenever you can see it sticking out.\n\n\nOn a similar note, if you have unruly white hair sticking out from beneath your collar, you should trim that every few days, as well. You could also have the neck hair permanently removed to lessen the hassle of shaving it yourself all the time.\n\n, Retinoid creams help the body produce more collagen, and collagen renews your skin, making it look younger and healthier while minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and age spots.\n\n\nYou can get over-the-counter retinoid creams, but prescription versions are more potent and may have a more dramatic effect.\nAttend to your fingernails. By this I mean look at them, are they normal or have they become yellow and thick? If they have yellowed that might mean you have a fungus, it is easily taken care of and your nails can look youthful again. Check with your doctor, he\/she can prescribe an antifungal liquid for it. They also sell antifungal liquid at most grocery stores in the medicine department.\n\n, They now have \"invisible\" braces to make it less noticeable that your teeth are getting aligned. Having beautiful teeth makes anyone more attractive, no matter your age., Yellowed teeth are another common sign of age. You can use a home whitening kit on your teeth for a quick fix, but for something that will last longer, see your dentist and ask to have a professional teeth whitening done. Keep in mind some foods discolor teeth, as does smoking. If you want your teeth to stay white avoid foods and drinks that are more likely to stain your teeth, such as coffee, for example.\n\n, While acupuncture is technically a form of alternative medicine, you still need to go to a licensed professional to have the procedure done. It is a far more natural treatment than cosmetic injections, however, which reduces the risk of an adverse reaction.\n\n\nAcupuncture needles are inserted into the face, neck, and head. They stimulate skin cells and improve circulation, so your skin ends up producing more collagen and elastin. As a result, the skin in those areas becomes firmer and more youthful in appearance., Treatments that use laser waves and radio waves cause microscopic fissures to form in the skin, and these fissures stimulate collagen production.\n\n\nRadio wave treatments can be quite painful, but if you can endure them, you should notice considerably firmer, younger looking skin within six months.\n\n, Hyaluronic acid fillers are injected into the skin, where they spread out and fill wrinkles and similar age lines. As a result, even the smallest lines of your face can look smoother within a short period of time.There are different filler treatments available, so talk to your doctor about which one might be best for you. Surface fillers work great on small lines and cause very little bruising, but deeper fillers might be necessary for deeper wrinkles.\n\n, This specialized procedure is used to lessen or eliminate spider veins. Since spider veins are associated with age, removing them can make you look younger.\n\n\nThe procedure used to be very painful, but newer techniques have made the procedure quicker and less uncomfortable.\n\n, During this procedure, pulsed light is combined with a specialized topical drug to destroy abnormally pigmented skin cells. Within two or three sessions, sun-aged skin can look closer to its natural age.\n\n\nNote that this treatment also has a practical purpose since it can be used to target precancerous cells, as well.\n\n, During this procedure, acid is used to burn away the top layers of skin. This removes damaged skin and stimulates new skin growth, which can lead to a smoother, younger looking face.\n\n\nTrichloroacetic acid peels are among the most common chemical peels.\nSome treatments can cause scabbing and may take several weeks to heal, but there are a few newer treatments that can result in less immediate pain and discomfort.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":752}
{"text":", Signs and symptoms to be aware of in babies include:\n\n\nFever\nUnusual sleepiness and\/or irritability (such as constant crying)\nSwelling in the fontanel (the soft spot on the top of your baby's head)\nPoor feeding\nNeck stiffness\n\n, This is because the faster that medical treatment can be received, the better, both in terms of preventing spread and reducing your risk of dying from it. It is important to seek immediate medical care if you or someone else exhibits any of the following:\n\n\nNeck stiffness in addition to flu-like symptoms. Neck stiffness is one of the cardinal signs that often differentiates meningitis from a general flu-like illness; if you or someone else presents with this symptom, it is important to see a doctor immediately.\nFlu-like symptoms that seem more severe than normal.\nIt is important to understand that bacterial meningitis can be very serious and even fatal if not treated immediately.\nIf in doubt, seek a professional medical opinion sooner rather than later.\n\n, This is especially important if the affected person was diagnosed with bacterial meningitis.\n\n, Your blood will be examined for an elevated white blood cell count (a common sign of an infection), and your blood will also be cultured in a specialized dish to see what microorganisms (such as bacteria) grow.\n\n\nIf microorganisms such as bacteria are found in your blood (in what is called the \"blood culture\"), your doctor can confirm the presence of an infection and can know which bug is responsible for it.\nYour doctor can also test the bug that has grown in the dish for its \"antibiotic susceptibility.\" What this means is that he can see which antibiotics are or are not effective at killing the specific microorganism that has infected your body.\n\n, You will most likely receive this through the Emergency Room, to ensure that you get it quickly.\n\n\nThe purpose of the CT scan is to evaluate for any unusual swelling in your head area, and to check that it is safe for your doctors to proceed with what is called a \"lumbar puncture\" (the one test that can confirm for sure whether or not you have meningitis).If there is excessive swelling or inflammation, it may be too dangerous to perform a lumbar puncture (a spinal cord tap) due to the risk of what is called \"brain herniation.\" This is when brain tissue gets compressed, which can lead to death.\n\n, After a CT scan has been performed to ensure that it is safe, your doctor will insert a needle into your spinal canal to get a sample of \"CSF\" (cerebrospinal fluid). Your CSF will then be tested for the presence of bacteria and other microorganisms, among other things.\n\n\nIf you have meningitis, your lumbar puncture will most likely show the results of low glucose (sugar), elevated white blood cells (immune cells), and increased protein.\nYour doctor can also culture your CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) to see if any bacteria or microorganisms grow.\nIf so, your doctor can perform \"susceptibility testing\" to determine which antibiotics (or other antimicrobial agents) the bugs that are present are susceptible to (i.e., to determine the most effective choice of treatment for you moving forward).\n\n, This is because bacterial meningitis can be very dangerous and even fatal if not treated promptly. Therefore, doctors are trained to err on the side of caution and to give you the antibiotics until further test results become available.\n\n\nIf a bacterial meningitis is confirmed, your doctor will likely choose a more specific antibiotic for you moving forwards.\nThe choice of antibiotic will depend upon the results of the \"susceptibility testing;\" in other words, on which antibiotic was shown to have superior efficacy at treating the specific strain of bacterial meningitis that you have.\n\n, These are immune suppressing agents that can reduce potentially dangerous inflammation in the brain area and meninges (the specific area that meningitis affects).\n\n\nNote that, in more severe cases, anti-convulsant (anti-seizure) medications may also be needed.\nThis is because the infection and subsequent inflammation surrounding the brain area can lead to seizures in some of the more severe cases.\n\n, Elements of supportive care that will be offered and\/or recommended by your physician include:\n\n\nStopping all daily activities such as work and other things, and resting in bed until you show enough positive signs of recovery.\nDrinking plenty of fluids to keep your hydration levels in a safe and appropriate range. IV fluids may be given in a hospital setting if oral fluids alone are insufficient.\nReceiving pain medications to reduce your fever and body aches as needed.\n\n,\n\n\nIf it is determined that you have viral meningitis, the mainstays of treatment are supportive care, as well as plenty of rest and ongoing medical supervision and check-ups until you recover.\nIf you have viral meningitis caused by HSV (the herpes simplex virus), you may receive antiviral treatment. However, all other causes of viral meningitis do not currently have treatment available.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":753}

Keep in mind that criminal records are public, and your boss will be able to find out the reason through other channels.\nTell your boss the dates you will be in jail.\n\n, In the second paragraph, tell your boss you would like to take a leave of absence, extended vacation, or preserve your job in some other way. Let them know that you understand if that cannot be arranged, but let them know you would like to reapply for your job or a similar job once you are released if necessary.\n\n, If time is of the essence and you will be missing work, you will not want to wait for a regular mail service to get the letter to your boss.\n\n, It is best to do this in person. Some situations make that impossible, however, such as:\n\n\nYour boss in not in the same location as you.\nYour boss is on vacation.\nYou are incarcerated without prior notice.\n\n, The person who communicates for you should be someone you trust and who you believe will present the information in a professional manner. This could be:\n\n\nYour attorney\nYour spouse\nA trusted co-worker\nA trusted friend or relative\n\n, Be sure this person knows all of the information necessary and how to properly inform your boss. They will need to tell your boss what is going on and how it will (or won\u2019t) impact your job. They should:Tell your boss you are sorry, but that you will be or are going to jail.\nTell your boss the reason you will be going to jail if you hope to keep your job. Keep in mind that criminal records are public, and your boss will be able to find out the reason through other channels.\nTell your boss the dates you will be in jail.\n\n, Your messenger should tell your boss you would like to take a leave of absence, extended vacation, or preserve your job in some other way. Let them know that you understand if that cannot be arranged, but let them know you would like to reapply for your job or a similar job once you are released if necessary.\n\n, In most cases, an employer can fire you for missing work because of incarceration. In fact, in most cases, you can be fired from your job for any reason so long as it is not a prohibited reason, such as discrimination. , Many jails have education and job training programs to help you gain employment once you are released., They may be able to help you apply for your old job or one similar to it.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":754}
{"text":" Be careful not to disturb or damage them while working around them.\n\nBarely loosen (break loose) each of the 11 bolts (10mm) connecting the OHC (overhead cam) valve cover to the engine. Loosen the 9 bolts around the edge of the cover that connect it to the block (one in on the very end). Two of those 10mm bolts are upon the cover with one about 3 times longer and (it was covered up by that power steering hose) and the one in the center is about 4 times longer than the ones around the edges. Once all are just loosened then finish removing them.,, The engine should be easy to turn with a socket wrench on the crankshaft bolt since the spark plugs are out and all pressure is released., aligned with the top of the engine head while at the same time you line up the timing mark on the crankshaft harmonic pulley pointing straight up at the same time as the cams are aligned (or use the crankshaft key and slot later in the process when the harmonic pulley is off).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution: the TDC (top dead center) could be 180 degrees off of the correct TDC even when the crankshaft mark or crankshaft key is correctly pointing straight up (\"It would then be at the top of the exhaust stroke.\"); so then align it as explained next.\nCaution: check timing is at the correct TDC (top dead center of the compression stroke) and find the marks are on the back of the sprockets and align them with the edge of the engine head. The older models have a distributor and you can remove the distributor cap to see if it is pointing at spark plug cable terminal number one (for cylinder number 1) when the mark on crankshaft pulley shows it is at TDC. If it points to the opposite side of the distributor then turn the engine slowly 360 degrees on the crankshaft to be back around to TDC (\"top of the compression stroke\"). Newer engines do not have a distributor and so the correct TDC can be found while the harmonic pulley timing mark is approaching TDC. This is done using the compression stroke air pressure measured in the \"number one spark plug hole\" by a \"compression gauge\" to know when the piston is on the compression stroke and then turning slowly and carefully to exactly the TDC as shown by the crankshaft and the cam sprockets timing marks. Compression pressure means that the piston in cylinder one was on the compression stroke not the exhaust stroke which also comes to TDC.\nRequired: securely place a \"plastic\/rubber\" stop-block (you may use a bottle stopper from a wine bottle preferably \"not real cork\" which might crumble) to put it in place to jam the cam sprockets with the \"rubber stop-block.\" Use the stop-block before releasing the tensioner pulley to remove the timing belt, or else when the timing belt is removed the cams will \"turn\" (in opposite directions) about two notches--pushed by the valve springs pressure off TDC of the cam lobes. Later before the timing belt is re-installed use two \"open-end\" wrenches or adjustable spanners for 1 inch (25.5 ~ 26mm) on the hex part of the camshaft (not on the sprocket bolt) to slightly nudge the sprockets back and forth (small wiggling) to get the stop block to hold both cam marks correctly aligned while the stop-block is between the two cam sprockets. So it holds both cams at the same time in TDC position (You may purchase a special stop-block made for this purpose if you prefer.).\n\n, Put on the parking brake.,, Then use a jack-stand to support the car. Do not depend on the jack to support it. You will be removing the wheel adjacent to (next to) the pulleys only.,, Watch your head., It should work under the air conditioner bracket which is massive on the older models. The engine being supported is because you will remove (not yet) the motor mount in steps when you get to it in a later step; that mount is between the top and lower halves of the timing-cover and is very much in the way of working on the accessory belts, timing belt and water pump., The two toward the firewall of the auto are difficult to reach and even to see. Use a short, small ratchet drive extension., You probably can wiggle and jiggle the pulley while start gently prying and pulling it off the crankshaft. If not, then you may need to use a steering wheel puller or similar puller., This was necessary to be able to remove the lower timing cover., One screw is hard to see in the middle of the cover, right below the motor mount.,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":755}

{"text":" 1) The bully who taunts and hurts others openly, and 2) The bully who enlists adults to bully others on their behalf. Learning to recognize these two types of bullies will help you avoid suffering at their hands.;\n, This kind of bully often taunts others loudly and pushes\/shoves\/kicks in order to get and keep your attention. The danger of this type of bully is fairly obvious. Being taunted with insults can cause temporarily hurt feelings, but the addition of aggressive physical contact takes this type of bully into the dangerous category. These bullies are attracted to those who are popular around them (not often weak or diminutive) and they tend to pursue them openly, despite the presence of adults or physically stronger children. They are difficult to manage and are often a regular presence in detention rooms around the school for their uncontrollable behaviour.\n\n, Make eye-contact brief but meaningful as you pass by them, and greet them as if you are giving a friend a \"shout-out\" (keeping your voice up and cheerful sounding).\n\n, Wave at them with your arm held high in the air if they shout out to you, and laugh and shake your head as you walk away.\n\n\nTreat shoving\/kicking\/pushing as aggression initiated and stay solid on your feet as you shove them back. Sending a taunting and touching bully reeling into a crowd creates plenty of disruption for you to make an artful escape, and will give you the extra moment lead you'll want to let an adult know about the altercation.\n\n, Give them the impression that you have a mean streak that has yet to be seen, but that you're willing to offer him a personal demonstration if he continues to show interest.\n\n,, Once the bully is subdued, quietly tell him\/her you'll remember them, smile, and walk away. Repeat this as often as necessary.\n\n, This kind of bully taunts others quietly and seeks out adults to enlist their support in bullying you. They are typically unpopular, are physically weaker than their peers, and tend to be known as tattle-tales by other classmates. These quiet bullies lie to unsuspecting adults (as well as physically stronger peers) and manipulate their sympathies to exact revenge against those classmates who dare to not like them. They have a distorted sense of self worth that makes them feel entitled to the respect and friendship of everyone with whom they come into contact.\n\n\nThe danger in dealing with this type of bully is harder to quantify. These bullies are not concerned with hurting others physically or mentally, directly (they are aware that their lack of strength, stature, and sharp wit put them at an extreme disadvantage when trying to intimidate their peers). Their goal is to use others to carry out their intimidation and bullying.\n\n, When crossed, because they tend to enlist the support of powerful adults, the quiet bully can indirectly cause others physical harm (corporal punishment administered by school authorities and\/or parents) as well as harm to their enemies' future (via notations added to school files, falsely labelling a student as a \"bully\", which may be used to evaluate their college\/employment applications later in life.).\n\n,, After you've done that, go to the school counsellor and explain what is happening to you, and express your fear that this little bully will convince the teacher that you are doing things you haven't done.\n\n,, Should you wind up in trouble, you'll need your parents to argue any addition to your school records made by these teachers under the direction of the bully.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":758}

Think about art projects they\u2019d like to accomplish, or about work that they haven\u2019t finished.\nLook for rare or quirky team memorabilia for a sporty friend. Check out EBay for autographed cards, bobbleheads, stickers or other sports items that others are unlikely to have.\nBuy toys for the person\u2019s pets. Pets are important to their owners, and sometimes a gift for a pet can mean as much as a gift for their owner!\nContinue to think outside the box. Remember that no matter what your friend\u2019s interests are, your gift should be thoughtful and interesting.\n\n, If you're giving a gift to a close friend, a good gift will be one that you and a friend can both relate to, and one with a great deal of meaning. Think of a gift that symbolizes your relationship, and remember, thoughtfulness and effort can mean more than money. Make a gift that may reference things that you have done together.\nMake a scrapbook with all your photos. This can be a great gift, as your friend will appreciate the time you put into it, and it will bring back memories.\nMake something simple like a friendship bracelet or necklace to remind your friend of how much you care.\n\n, Sometimes, a meaningful message or letter can be more thoughtful than a physical object. Pair your letter with a gift and you'll definitely make an impression. Don\u2019t make it too long-winded though!\n\n, Simply spending time with someone can show them that you care, and experiences can be even more fun than a physical item that they might not get much use out of. Take a friend out for dinner, drinks, a concert or a movie. As with physical gifts, think about your friends personality and interests and choose a gift accordingly.\nBuy your friend a membership to a local museum, aquarium or zoo. They will get free entry for a year as well as special perks for joining.\nGo a little crazy! Sometimes, gifts that seem impossible are more reasonably priced than you might imagine.

{"text":", Older single pane windows transmit (lose) heat more quickly than newer double or triple glazed windows which are far better at isolating different air temperatures on either side.,, A space below an attic with insulated floors or located above a basement are considered insulated.,, Most spaces require 10 watts per square foot of space for homes built since the 1970s. A 12 foot (3.7\u00a0m) by 12 foot (3.7\u00a0m) room has 144 sq\/ft. Assuming a ceiling height less than 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m), this room should be heated comfortably with 1500 watts of heat. 1500 watts of heat is a total of 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) of heat, assuming \"standard density\" baseboard heaters are selected for installation. Standard density heat is rated at 250 watts per foot. There is one other type of heat called \"high density\" (HD). HD heat has more than the 250 watts per foot that the standard density heat has, but does not heat quicker nor is operated for any less. HD merely provides more heat with a smaller footprint., All of the considerations above (windows type and number, insulation, etc.) will come into play when purchasing heaters. The baseline wattage should be increased by up to 100% if the room suffers from all of the considerations. It is important to note that adding additional heaters will not increase the cost of operation. Additional heaters allow the room to maintain desired temperature during the colder days, as opposed to having the minimum heat (or baseline) installed. If only the baseline calculated amount of heat were installed, it would not be able to replace the heat as quickly as it was lost due to lack of insulation, single pane windows, etc. A room that ideally requires 1500 watts of heat might need as much as 3000 watts if it suffers from all the issues listed above. This applies to ALL types of heat (and cooling in the summer for that matter), regardless of fuel type or technology. Insulation is inexpensive over the long run., The heat can be installed one of two ways. In the example room, install (1) 1500 watt heater or install 2 or more heaters totaling 1500 watts. The latter method can be employed for rooms at the corners of a building - having 2 exterior walls. Typically, heaters are installed below windows, where most of the heat loss occurs. Adding more watts of heat will allow the room to reach the desired temperature faster than if no additional watts of heat were installed., Installing 240 volt heaters is best as wire sizes and number of circuits are significantly reduced. The National Electrical Code allows a 15 amp circuit to carry up to 12 amps, and a 20 amp circuit may carry up to 16 amps. The total watts allowed to be connected can be determined simply by multiplying volts by amps only because this is a purely resistive AC circuit (AC wattage calculations are much more complex for inductive and capacitive reactant circuits that exist in appliances and electronics). The 15 amp circuit is 240 x 12 = 2880 watts. The 20 amp circuit is 240 x 16 = 3840 watts. This is a maximum of 14 and 19 feet of 240 volt, standard density heat, respectively., The thermostat should be located on an interior wall. It should never be located above a heater or other heat source, or in a dead air space such as behind a door., Cut the wall open with knife or hand saw., This may require fishing or snaking of the cable between the points, and will probably be most time consuming. For this reason, many times a single heater sized to heat the entire space is often selected so that fishing or snaking is minimized. Indicate this cable as the \"LINE\" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Examine the heater(s) and remove BOTH front covers from both ends of each heater. Place the heater(s) against the wall at the desired location., Because they are provided, no box(es) need be installed in the wall. Simply create a small hole in the wall for the cable from which to emerge and pass through appropriate connectors at the back of one of the compartments to allow the cables to enter. Connections are to be made in the compartments. This is detailed below., Indicate this cable as the \"LOAD\" so it can be determined as such after it has been installed in the box for the thermostat., Continue to daisy-chain between successive heaters as needed.,, Push the cable into the connector until 1\u20442 inch (1.3\u00a0cm) of the jacket is inside the wiring compartment.,,,,,,,,,,,, Connect ALL the bare and any green wires together with a wirenut.

{"text":" Just because you have a business that you want to operate does not mean that a corporation is the best decision. You should consider the legal options that exist for a business operation in Georgia:Corporation. A corporation can exist for profit, or as a non-profit, or as a professional corporation (PC). The main reason for choosing to incorporate is to separate yourself and your personal assets from the assets and obligations of the business.Limited Liability Company (LLC). An LLC offers convenience, because you report the income of the business in your own tax return. But it also limits personal liability in the way that a corporation does.Sole proprietorship. A sole proprietorship is convenient because you operate the business on your own, without any additional legal organization. You report all profits and losses in your own tax returns. However, you are personally responsible for all of the business\u2019s obligations and liabilities.Partnership. A partnership is legally similar to a sole proprietorship, but more than one person operates the business. The partners each receive their share of the income and assume their share of the company\u2019s obligations. All income and losses are reported in personal tax returns.;\n, Once you have made the decision to incorporate, your new corporation needs a name. According to Georgia law, your business name must be \u201cdistinguishable\u201d from the names of other existing corporations.When you select a name, you can reserve it online at http:\/\/ecorp.sos.ga.gov. There is an application fee of $25, which you can pay with a credit card.\nYou may also download the name reservation form at http:\/\/sos.ga.gov\/corporations\/acrobat\/applications\/Form%20-%20Name%20Reservations.pdf and mail it in with the $25 payment.\nAfter you reserve your name, you have 30 days to complete the remaining steps for incorporation. After 30 days, the name is no longer reserved, and someone else may select it.\n\n, Within 90 days after filing your Articles of Incorporation, you must file an initial annual registration form with the Secretary of State. This form must identify three officers of your corporation. There is a filing fee of $50 for this report.The link for filing this report through the Georgia Corporations Division website is https:\/\/ecorp.sos.ga.gov\/ARForm.\n\n, In Georgia, anyone planning to incorporate a business must publish a notice of intent in the newspaper that is the \u201cofficial legal organ\u201d of the county where the business is located. You can find a list of these official newspapers at www.gsccca.org\/clerks. You can prepare this ahead of time, but it must be filed no later than the day after you file your Articles of Incorporation.The notice can be a simple letter that reads, \u201cDear Publisher, Please publish once a week, for two consecutive weeks, a notice in the following form: Notice is given that articles of incorporation that will incorporate (Name of Corporation) have been delivered to the Secretary of State for filing in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code. The initial registered office of the corporation is located at (Address) and its initial registered agent is (Name of agent).

In the notice, you will refer to the Georgia Non-Profit Corporation Code rather than the Georgia Business Corporation Code.\n\n, You may or may not be required to have an EIN to operate your business. Contact the IRS at 866-816-2065 or research their website at www.irs.ustreas.gov., According to Georgia law, the Articles of Incorporation must include certain minimal information. The law only sets out the required minimums for the Articles of Incorporation to be filed.

The name must include some form of \u201cIncorporated,\u201d \u201cCorporation,\u201d \u201cInc.,\u201d or some clear indication that the business is a corporation., If your corporation operates for profit, you must include in the Articles of Incorporation the number of shares that the corporation will be authorized to issue. This does not need to be a number that is being issued immediately. You may need to consult with legal counsel on certain strategies and options related to issuing corporate shares.You can create different \"classes\" of stock shares, with each class having different rights or privileges. For example, one class of shares may have voting rights while another does not.\nThe Articles of Incorporation need to define the classes of shares that will be authorized and the number of shares in each class., This is for non-profit corporations only. Instead of issuing shares, a non-profit corporation may have \u201cmembers.\u201d The members of a non-profit corporation generally have voting rights in directing the actions of the corporation. Your Articles of Incorporation must report whether you intend to define membership, and, if so, how many members are anticipated., This must be the legal address where the corporation will receive mail and legal notices. It may or may not be the same address as the location of actual business operations., Every corporation must have at least one registered agent. The agent may or may not be an officer or an incorporator of the corporation. The agent must be someone who is identifiable to receive legal notices and mail for the corporation., The incorporators may or may not serve as officers of the corporation. These are the individuals who have served in preparing the Articles of Incorporation. Personal addresses for each incorporator must be included., The principal office is the location where the actual operations of the corporation take place.

{"text":" Start with short intervals and increase the time with the bunny. Consider placing a nice plate of greens out for the rabbit to eat while you stroke the rabbit to decrease any potential anxiety.\n\n\nDon't make sudden moves or sounds that might alarm your rabbit. Be gentle and soothing when you pet the rabbit. Rabbits are prey animals, so when they feel threatened, they run and hide if they can.\nSit on the floor to minimize your size and avoid towering over the bunny.;\n, Never pick up a rabbit by his ears, legs, or tail.Rabbits are very delicate and you could severely injure them if you pick them up incorrectly.Grabbing on to limbs, tails, or ears will cause the rabbit to react by pulling away. Doing so may cause a fracture or a dislocation or tearing of underlying muscle and soft tissue.A bunny new to the household should be picked up and restrained by adults at first. Children can pet the bunny while it is on the floor or while sitting in the child\u2019s (or adult\u2019s) lap sitting on the floor.\nStaying close to the ground for a while is a good preventative measure. Should the rabbit try to escape, they will not fall a long distance and potentially injure themselves.\n\n, Reward the rabbit with a treat afterward. This will help it get used to the feeling of being picked up., Do not pick the rabbit up by the scruff alone, but use this as a handle to prevent forward motion while you use your other hand arm to tuck the hind legs under the bunny and scrunch the bunny in a gentle \u201cbunny ball.\u201d\n\n\nYour free hand that is not holding the scruff should be placed on the bunny\u2019s rump. You should roll the back legs underneath, toward the front of the bunny, holding the feet up with your hand. This will prevent the rabbit from kicking out and potentially injuring itself.\nThere are differing opinions on whether or not to scruff a rabbit. Scruffing, done gently, does not injure the rabbit., Place one under his chest and one under its behind. The positioning should be comfortable for both you and the rabbit. Make sure you have a firm (but not tight) grip on the rabbit's body so that it doesn't leap from your hands when you lift.\n\n\nMake sure to contain the hind legs securely, by keeping your hand on the rump and scrunching the hind legs up toward the bunny\u2019s head. Remember, you are holding the hind legs so that they point forward, toward the head, the opposite direction of where the hind legs would be should the bunny kick out.\nIt may help to kneel to get closer to the rabbit, so you don't have to bend and lift. Get down on the ground with the rabbit.\n\n, It's best to lift a rabbit either from a top-opening cage or a confined area in your house. It can be much more difficult to lift a rabbit from a side opening cage. Rabbits will often run and hide when approached, so trying to pick up a rabbit in a room with lots of furniture will also be difficult.\n\n\nWhen removing a rabbit from a side or front opening carrier, do so with the hind legs first out of the opening. That way, if they get out of your grip, they will jump back into the carrier and not down to the ground.Use one hand to hold the bunny\u2019s head away from you, toward the back of the cage, while gently holding on to the scruff. The other hand is used over the bunny\u2019s rump to scrunch the hind legs up into the \u201cbunny ball\u201d hold. Then lift the bunny out, hind legs toward you, and place under your arm so the bunny\u2019s head is given a place to hide.\nIf you are getting the bunny out of a top-opening carrier, you can use the same technique, just remember not to dangle the bunny by the scruff.\nIf this is a well handled and calm bunny, you are likely to be able to safely pick up the bunny with one hand under its chest and one hand scrunching the rump, without holding on to the scruff.\nBe aware, that if the bunny feels like it might fall, it will struggle and kick and try to get down. If this happens, place the bunny back in the carrier and re-grip or go back to using the scruff to help with restraint.\n\n, If your rabbit tends to run under furniture, coax it out with a treat before trying to pick it up. Better yet, manage the area to prevent the rabbit from being able to get away and hide so that it doesn't have access to hiding places that are difficult for you to access. Try using an exercise pen to confine the bunny, but still allowing them an area large enough to hop around.\n\n\nNever pull on a rabbit's legs or tail to get it to move closer to you. It is better to gently get a hold of the scruff to prevent the rabbit from getting away, then you can get an arm around the rabbit\u2019s body and contain the hind legs. Never forcefully scruff a rabbit or dangle it by the scruff. This will cause the rabbit injury.\n\n, If a rabbit thumps a hind leg when you approach, be aware that this is a warning to you that you are in their territory and they are not thrilled with your presence. The rabbit may be more difficult to handle, so be prepared.\n\n\nAgain, remember to use confinement within an exercise pen or other area to help you manage the rabbit\u2019s access to hiding places and allow you find and restrain the rabbit more easily.\n\n, Do not point its head down because the rabbit may then try to jump down, out of your arms, and may hurt itself.\n\n, The rabbit will feel more secure being able to hide a bit. Your rabbit should be held and carried securely under your arm, nestled comfortably under your \u201cwing.\u201dSome people call this the \u201cfootball hold.\u201d\n\n\nIf you are right handed, place the bunny\u2019s head under your left arm. Wrap your left arm around the outside of the rabbit while using your left hand to continue to securely hold the rabbit\u2019s hind legs under it.\nPlace your right hand gently over the bunny\u2019s neck, ready to get a hold of the scruff should the bunny move suddenly.\nDo not hold your rabbit extended outward or swing it through the air.\n\n, Ideally, place the rabbit on a table and restrain it while the other person gets a hold of the bunny. Don't try to pass the bunny in mid air. This could lead to the rabbit getting loose and falling from a great height.\n\n, If you ever feel like you are losing control when carrying the rabbit, immediately crouch down to the ground or to a table to decrease the distance that it might fall. This will also give you a surface upon which to regroup and re-grip the bunny.\n\n, Some rabbits really dislike being handled and no amount of treats or petting will change their personalities. For these types, it's best to use a carrying case to move them from one place to the next, rather than attempting to pick them up.\n\n\nUse one hand to hold the scruff to restrain the rabbit and get your other hand on the rump and \u201cscrunch\u201d the bunny in a \u201cbunny ball\u201d to transfer to the carrier.\n\n, Be sure to keep a firm grip the entire time, because rabbits tend to try to jump once they can see the floor.\n\n, This method decreases the chance of the bunny kicking out and injuring itself., After spending time in your arms without biting or leaping away, your obedient rabbit deserves a treat. Gently pet it as you give it a reward. The rabbit will realize that being picked up isn't so bad, and next time it may even go more smoothly.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":772}

You can also add them in a heavy iron pot and mash them up into powder before adding to your garden.\n\n, One can also use cheesecloth to strain out the pulp to, but the metal mesh screen is easier.\n\n, You can put the cubes in a bowl and microwave, or just put in pot then add a little more water, vegetables, meats, beans, spinach, diced tomatoes, corn, rice, and cook for another 30 minutes or so.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":773}
{"text":" There is no doubt that it is absolutely simple. You will need:\n\n\n1 Rubber Band\n1 Sheet of Paper\nScissors or Ruler (Optional);\n, Take your piece of paper. Cut or tear the piece of paper into smaller pieces with your hands, scissors, ruler, etc. The small papers should be roughly near 7 cm by 1 cm. Scrunch up the small pieces of paper into a good-sized, tight and firm paper ball. This will be called a mini-paper bullet. Make a few more bullets to add to your ammo stock.\n\n, Wrap it around your thumb and index finger. Make sure to put the rubber band on your default hand (hand that you usually use).\n\n, Pinch it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand. Don't let go of the bullet.\n\n, If you are pulling the closest band towards you, you are doing it correctly.\n\n,,, Pull the band that is further away from you towards you. This will overlap the band that is closest towards you. Do not pull the band closest towards you.\n\n,,,, This time, pull both bands.\n\n,, The tricky part is coming up. Although it is easy to do practically, describing it in words is a different matter.\n\n, Pull it under the band farthest from you.\n\n, Hold the bullet by pinching it with your thumb and index finger of your other hand.\n\n,,,, That is, wrapped around your thumb and index finger.\n\n, Twist the band you are holding and place it in the base of your middle finger. Your middle finger should be resting near the middle of your palm.\n\n, Pull back the rubber band with the bullet.\n\n,, Whether in school, home, or work, you've got to hide your masterpiece of fun. In school, you might shoot your bullets across the room but you should hide your weapon so that people aren't suspicious of you. You certainly don't want your enemy or other people using your weapon. The best hiding spot for your bullets is your pocket. Shorts pocket, jacket pocket, all are fine. Hiding it in a pocket is another good thing because your hand could reach it easily.\n\n, Pretend to be writing or pretend to be doing something with your hands. The person you shot might think that your working hands means that it is too busy for games.\n\n, The rubber band makes a twanging sound after firing the bullet so it is a good idea to hide it quickly. If you have a watch, you could use it to cover up your rubber band. Or else you put it inside a pocket or put it next to other bracelets or things on your arm to make it look like everyday stuff.\n\nYou might not get it to shoot well at first, but remember to place the bullet in the right place so the power will go into the bullet.

{"text":";\n, Never wear make-up, although if you have freckles, you might want to use some foundation to cover them up.\n\n, Gold has a wealthy aura. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look.\n\n, Just because you got some clothes from an upper class store doesn't mean they are preppy. Buy clothes that are classic, and clean-cut. Don't be afraid to splurge on these a little, as preps tend to hold onto clothes for a long time. Remember to make sure your clothes are always clean, and always match. Good fabrics are very important. Get rid of any polyester. Buy mostly 100%cotton, wool and cashmere. Wear preppy colors. Bright and happy, like green, pink, light blue, nautical red, white and navy blue and preppy patterns such as plaid, stripes, gingham, polka dots, argyle, floral, paisley, nova checks, and tartan.\n\n\nHere are some suggestions for that type of clothing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolo shirts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxford shirts (unlike polos, oxford shirts should always be long-sleeved if it is warm outside simply roll up the sleeves)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby shirt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCable-knit vests and sweaters (traditional cricket sweaters)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA jacket or blazer (navy blue is a staple; try seersucker or madras plaid in summer, tweed in winter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChino pants-could have cuffs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKhaki pants. The prep equivalent to jeans\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBermuda shorts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen or preppy prints and patterns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkirts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen, preppy prints and patterns)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTea dresses and summer dresses (in madras plaid, preppy colors, seersucker, or linen). A-line dresses, halters, and flowy dresses are acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTennis- and golf-inspired shirts, skirts, and dresses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow the right stores and the right things to buy. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actually store(check tips for a minor addition to this section).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you're unsure about how to put together outfits, Google \"preppy outfits\".\n\n, Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe\/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing.\n\n, It will make you look, annoying, and is sometime insulting to real Brits.\n\n,, If you want to be like the one from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" the 2005 film, don't worry too much about it.\n\n, Did someone use the last napkin? Did someone forget to put the toothpaste cap back on? Remember that you're only pretending; there's no reason to flip a table over a pretend grudge\n\n, Otherwise, your bad reputation (see warnings) may make people accuse them of being \"drunk.\"\n\n,, Always have it on you.\n\n,, Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Never tell people about \"bad things\" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, than don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life.\n\n, Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it.\n\n,, Work really hard at your schoolwork and make sure you get grades no lower than 'B+'. If you do, pout and kick up a fuss (but not to the teacher!) A 'C' is unacceptable!\n\n, It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like \"aberrant,\" \"culpable,\" or \"capricious.\" Having a vocabulary like this increases charm and wit, which can be considered a MUST in higher circles.\n\n, Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy\/posh. T shirts and sweatpants will not cut it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or some designer. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some \"minor designer\" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Mossimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work.\n\n, Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste\/Tommy Hilfiger\/Nautica polo's and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant.\n\n, When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pink or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should be tidy.\n\n, As cliched as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like B\u00e9chamel and Beaujolais. And learn good table manners. Otherwise you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read etiquette books(American Girl is good).\n\n, Having a coffee or tea at hand also makes you look rich.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":775}
{"text":" For the most part, the interesting information that a chemist seeks are electronic energies of atoms and molecules. The calculation can also predict if the compound is stable enough to be existent.;\n, These orbitals are responsible for the chemical characteristics of the molecules, namely whether they will react with other molecules or not and by which symmetry.\n\n, They are difficult to calculate accurately due to the involvement of many atoms in their molecular structure. However, organic compounds which have small number of atoms are relatively easy to calculate due to the low electron count in them.\n\n, In particular, the interaction between the LUMO of one compound and the HOMO of the other reactant are important. The difference in energetics between these two orbitals as well as the matching of the symmetry will dictate if there will be a reaction between these two compounds. Therefore, it is important to perform calculations on the energetics of these orbitals and not on the inner core orbitals in order to verify if there will be a reaction between these two molecules or not.\n\n, This equation is nonrelativistic and does not account for relativistic effects such as the phenomenon of the spin. The quantum mechanical variant of this equation that involves relativistic effects on atoms and molecules is called the Dirac equation.\n\n, For atomic systems it is solved only for the hydrogen atom in an exact manner. In this case also the solution involves formidable mathematical equations that involve laplacian in spherical coordinates. In addition, it involves also differential equations that are not straightforward to solve for the practitioner chemist.\n\n, For this reason many efforts were done in order to overcome this difficulty by deriving several approximation methods that are called perturbative methods. They involve solving the the energy term of the perturbation itself and then adding it to the general energy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.\n\n, This is especially important for many electron atoms and molecules. In many electron atoms there are two main perturbations that prevent from solving the Schroedinger equation in an exact manner. These are: the correlation between electrons or the repulsion forces between the various electrons which add a term to the Hamiltonian that makes the mathematics impossible for solving the problem. This electronic correlation is manifested not only in many electrons atoms but also in all molecules.\n\n, It originates due to the relative motion of the nucleus around the electron itself. The movement of the nucleus around the electron generates a magnetic field that can interact with the spin and angular magnetic moment of the electron, thus giving rise to an additional term in the atomic Hamiltonian that impedes an accurate solution of the Schroedinger equation.\n\n, Nowadays there are many perturbative methods such as the Muller plesset method which includes correlation between electrons in the Hamiltonian. In addition a popular method that is being used more and more in computational chemistry is the density functional theory which has the advantage of being less time consuming than the other methods. Additional computational methods especially useful for transition state calculations include the coupled cluster methods. for thermodynamic calculations a very efficient method is the semi-empirical method especially the PM3 method.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":776}

The same rules apply to PWCs.\n\n, Boats generally travel in a consistent linear pattern whereas PWC operators often ride in impulsive, erratic \"freestyle\" patterns of S curves, circles and figure eights, which substantially increase the potential for collision with a boat and may run afoul of the \"rules of the road\".\n\n\nSpatial disorientation and inattention can quickly result by being lost in the moment but increase the risk of being hit by another boat after having quickly but unwittingly maneuvered the PWC directly into the path of another boat's immediate strike zone.

{"text":" The potsticker dough may reach a better consistency if the water is slightly warm.Boil 1\/3 cup (80 mL) water, then remove from heat and add 2\/3 cup (160 mL) room temperature water.\n\n\nAlternatively, heat 1 cup (240 mL) water on low heat and remove from heat after one to three minutes. If the water begins to simmer or boil, remove from heat and let cool to slightly above room temperature before using.;\n, While none of these ingredients are required to make guo tie, some recipes call for salt, vegetable oil, and\/or egg.Stirring roughly 1\/4 tsp (1 mL) salt (or a small pinch) into the water may add flavor. The other optional ingredients should be added to the flour instead, before you continue to the next step. Mix the flour with 1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil and\/or 1 small egg to add flavor and help the dough stick together. Continue as usual, but be aware that the egg will add more liquid to the dough, so you will probably not end up using all your water in the next step.\n\n\nIf this is your first time making potstickers, you may wish to skip this step to keep things simple. If the wrappers fall apart or taste too bland, you may add one or more of these ingredients in your next attempt.\n\n, Put 2 cups (480mL) all-purpose flour into a large bowl. Add the warm water a little at a time, stirring the ingredients together with chopsticks or a wooden mixing spoon. Stop adding water once the dough feels slightly sticky, and there is no more dry flour visible.\n\n\nDepending on the brand of flour and the humidity in your kitchen, you may not need to use all of the water you prepared. Keep the extra water around during the next few steps in case the dough dries out.\n\n, Once the dough becomes too sticky to stir, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the flour and water together. The dough should become smooth within a few minutes of kneading. Stop when the dough has no lumps and can be formed into a ball.\n\n\nAdd a light dusting of flour to the work surface or your hands if the dough sticks to them. Knead in more flour if the dough is too wet to work with.\nIf you see dry flour that isn't mixed into the dough, or if the dough won't stick together into a ball, add a little more warm water and knead it in.\nRemember to wash and dry your hands thoroughly before you begin kneading.\n\n, Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it in a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. This will trap the moisture released by the dough and cause it to soften.Let the dough sit for at least 10 minutes, and preferably for half an hour.\n\n\nTo save time, make the filling while you wait. This step does not have to be precisely timed, so return to the dough once you are done making the filling.\n\n, Return to the dough after it's had enough time to \"relax,\" or soften into an easily manipulated ball. Pull it apart into small pieces, each one using about 1\/20th of the total dough. You may find it easier if you first divide the dough into four large pieces, then cut each of these large pieces into five smaller ones.\n\n\nAlternatively, you may use your hand to roll out the entire ball of dough into a long log 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut this log into discs 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide., Sprinkle flour over a flat, clean counter or cutting board to prevent the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece of dough over this surface, creating circles about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across.Use smaller circles if the dough breaks apart or looks translucent, as the dumplings may fall apart if they are rolled too thin.\n\n\nYou can speed up the rolling process by using the heel of your palm to flatten each piece of dough into a roughly circular shape before you roll it out more thoroughly.\nFilling the potstickers may be easier if you keep the center of the circle thick and the outside edges thin.\n\n, After each circle is finished, sprinkle both sides generously with flour to prevent sticking, and add it to the stack of finished dough circles. Your dumpling wrappers are now complete.\n\n, Cover wrappers with a damp paper towel to keep them moist as you work. Once you have made the wrappers, it is best to fill them immediately before they dry out. Store unused wrappers in the fridge if you will use them within a few days, or freeze them and use any time in the next few months., Finely chop the vegetables until you have 1 cup (240 mL). While you can use any hard, leafy, green vegetables, guo tie are traditionally made using Napa cabbage or bok choy. Both of these vegetables are sometimes sold under the name \"Chinese cabbage.\"\n\n\nIf you are making vegetarian potstickers, chop 2 cups (480 mL) of vegetables instead.\n\n, Toss the chopped cabbage in 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Let sit five minutes while the salt draws out moisture, then drain the cabbage in a strainer or colander., To add a spicy flavor to the guo tie, peel fresh ginger and fresh garlic, then chop them finely until you have 1 tsp (5 mL) of each. Finally chop one or two stalks of green onion (scallions).\n\n, Mix these vegetables in a large bowl containing ground or finely minced meat. In different areas of Asia, ground pork, beef, or shrimp are all commonly used, or a mixture of these.\n\n\nWash your hands in warm, soapy water after handling raw meat to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria. Clean any surfaces or utensils that came into contact with the meat in hot, soapy water once you are done using them.\n\n, Mix in 2 tsp (10 mL) soy sauce, 2 tsp (20 mL) sesame oil or Chinese cooking wine, and 1\/2 tsp (2.5 mL) pepper. There are many variations on this recipe, and you may decide to replace some seasonings or add your own. Other common options include 1\/4 cup (60 mL) chicken stock or chicken broth, a dash of chili powder, or a dash of Chinese five spice powder.If you'd like to adjust the seasonings before you make the potstickers, take a small spoonful of filling and fry it in oil until it is browned through. Taste the filling and add more seasoning if necessary.\n\n, Take one of your circular potsticker wrappings and place it on the palm of the hand you use least.\n\n, Take approximately 1\/2\u20131 tablespoon (7\u201315 mL) of filling using a spoon or chopsticks and place in the center of the potsticker wrapper. If the dough is thin or the circles of dough are small, use less filling.\n\n, Fold the potsticker in half to make a half-moon shape, but do not press the edges completely together. Only press the center of the edges together, so the corners of the dumpling are still unattached.\n\n\n\nNote: If you are using storebought dumpling wrappers, use wet fingers to dampen the edges until they are soft enough to press together.\n\n, Grasp one layer of dough at the corner with your index finger and thumb, then fold it toward the center of the potsticker edge, where the two sides of the circle are pressed together.The soft dough should stretch into a classic potsticker pleat or wrinkle. Press the two layers of dough together at the fold to keep it in place.\n\n, Using the same technique, grasp one layer of dough at the corner and fold it over toward the center edge. Press together with the opposite layer of the potsticker. Repeat this until there are three or four folds on each potsticker, and the potsticker is completely closed.\n\n, Add cooking oil to a wok, flat skillet, or frying pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Heat over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer, or when a small piece of vegetable or filling sizzles when placed in the oil.\n\n\nUse a vegetable oil with a high smoking point, such as canola oil or peanut oil.\n\n, Carefully drop the potstickers into the pan from a short distance above the oil. Arrange them with a heat-safe utensil so the dumplings are close together but do not touch each other.You will likely need to cook your potstickers in several batches. Do not pile potstickers on top of each other in the pan, or they may not cook properly.\n\n, Cover the pan, reduce to low heat, and fry for a few minutes until the bottom of the potstickers are crisp and golden-brown. Depending on the temperature of the pan, this could take anywhere from two to seven minutes.You may lift the lid to check on the potstickers' progress.\n\n\nRemove from heat immediately if you smell burning. Use a heat-safe utensil to unstick the potstickers from the pan, and continue after one or two minutes.\n\n, Once one side of the potstickers are brown, lift the lid and pour 1\u20133 tablespoons (15\u201345 mL) water onto the pan, just enough to cover the base of the pan with a shallow layer.\n\n\nPour the water while rapidly moving in a circular motion around the edge of the pan. This distributes the water evenly and prevents one part of the pan from cooling down too quickly. This also reduces splatter from hot oil and water coming into contact.\n\n, Cover the pan again and cook on moderate or low heat for 4-5 minutes. Add more water if it boils away before the potstickers are done cooking. Note that you do not need to flip the potstickers at any point in this process; it is intentional that they are only crisp on one side.\n\n\nRemove a potsticker and cut it open to check that it is done. The filling inside should be browned and fully cooked.\n\n, Remove the potstickers from the pan and cook additional batches if necessary. Once all the potstickers are cooked, serve them with a sauce of your choice:\n\n\nAny dark vinegar can be used alone or mixed with an equal amount of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil.\nMix vinegar with sherry or dry wine and sweet soy sauce for a sweeter dipping sauce.\nBlack pepper and sliced ginger add a sophisticated flavor, and can be provided with or without a dipping sauce.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":781}
{"text":" Election rules and dates for precinct official election are somewhat different for each of the 50 state.\n\n, Your precinct has workers from your neighborhood who make themselves available in each neighborhood. Someone will or can represent the political party at each precinct primary (or caucus) in most areas.\n\n\nSome precincts are not organized by one or the other of the parties. Such precincts (without many of your party) may yet yield your yeoman base of operation to get involved and may encourage more voters in your precinct to help county, state and national results for your party.\nSometimes the official and the poll workers are mostly friends (from an interested political group, club or religious group) or may be unacquainted individuals with the same cause and may support one another in any case.\nSome officials and delegates may have been doing this for many years. Some get involved after retiring from the daily job.\n\n, For example, for the winter and spring of each even year \u2013 and so be sure when the deadlines are exactly.\n\n, State law governs how parties qualify to be recognized as parties, and that is often only the Democratic and Republican parties, as they meet the rules for signatures and the number or percent of votes that have been received by them for state party. The Democratic and Republican party are established and control all 50 states and all 3141 counties. One may pick either the Democratic or Republican party with regard to running for precinct offices.\n\n, Ask them what precinct number you live in, and they will tell you. You can also find this out for yourself by getting the \u201cPrecinct Finder\u201d for your county. This is a book that lists all streets AND what precinct each is in. Some streets are in one precinct for a certain range of addresses and another precinct for another range of addresses such as: Oak Avenue addresses 2000 to 4012 are in Precinct 101; Oak Avenue addresses 4013 to 5180 are in Precinct 102, and so forth.\n\n, They will tell you where and how to get this information.\n\n\nIf you get a run around in any way, call your state Secretary of State, and ask them how to find the state laws that govern the precinct elections and the parties who have qualified to be recognized by your state in that period. Such questions are matter of state law. You can double check the rules regarding running from precinct executive by looking it up for yourself on the state website in many states in your state Legal Code.\n\n, So if you are running in the Republican Party you may need the valid signatures of ten registered Republicans or of those who are registered as independent work in that precinct. For instance, you declare your party by voting on the party ballot that you choose at the even year primary.\n\n\nEach party has a separate ballot and you legally may vote for only one party in the primary which is choosing the candidates for the fall general election. So if you have chosen to vote a Democratic ballot when you voted in the spring primary in 2008 -- then you are classified as a registered democrat until 2010, when you may change that.\n\n, Your precinct has set boundaries as does your county and state. Your precinct may be parts of 10 or 15 streets around your house in your town or the roads in a rural area. The map may be an aerial view of your precinct.\n\n, Where your precinct begins or ends is found on the walking list which will show you the addresses on each street or road.\n\n\nThe walking list tells you who are the registered voters in your precinct, whether they are registered as Republicans, Democrats, or Independents (or registered in another party qualified in your state, such as the Libertarian Party, Green Party, or Constitution Party, for instance).\n\n,,,);\nWhen you must have turned in your valid petition to the Board of Elections (for example: is that no later than 30 or is that 45 days before the primary?),\n\n(For instance, in your State if the Primary is on May 7th, the time to pick up your official precinct petition may begin 90 days earlier which is around February 7th, and the last day to turn it back in might be 30 days before the primary around April 7th. Turn it in a little earlier of course.)\n\n\n\n, If you have met the required number of valid signatures \u2013 then your name will be on the official ballot for only that one election in your precinct, on your party ballot, for that specific primary held in your state.\n\n\nIf you are unopposed for Precinct (executive) in your precinct for your party, then if at least you vote for yourself, then you win. If others have collected the required number of signatures to run for precinct executive in your precinct in your party, then they will also be on the ballot running against you.\nFor more than one candidate -- the candidate who gets the most votes (plurality - not necessary to be the majority) at the primary wins, and earns the right to go to the \"County Party Organizational Meeting\" a few weeks or a month or so later (at a local community center, VFW Hall, convention center, or wherever it is to be held) \u2013 and vote on who will makeup the Party Chairman and Party Executive Committee for your party in your county for the next 2 years.This may also be called the \"neighborhood precinct chair strategy\" by which you may begin to take over at the grassroots in America: precinct-by-precinct, county-by-county, state-by-state, and then your nation... through the all important Ballot Box.\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":782}

{"text":" This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.;\n, Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons).\n\n, Again, add room (1\/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design.\n\n, Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1\/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining.\n\n\nThe lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth.\nIf you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough.\nYou can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer.\n\n, On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric.\n\n, Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1\/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces.\n\n, At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam \u2013 the parts touching each other \u2013 are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and\/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows.\n\n, Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest.\n\n, First fold the top 1\/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1\/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam.\n\n, While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine.\n\n\nFor a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and\/or a contrasting color.\nPress the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add.\n\n\nMeasure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up.\n\n, Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other.\n\n,\n\n\nTo make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors.\nAlternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes.

{"text":" Alimony is intended to mitigate any unfair effect of divorce on the lower-earning spouse. The theory underpinning spousal support is that the lower-earning spouse may have postponed or foregone a career in order to support the family.Alimony therefore attempts to compensate the spouse for this sacrifice.\n\n\nAlimony is also intended to help a spouse maintain a standard of living he or she became accustomed to during marriage.Alimony is not a reward for surviving a difficult marriage or a means to punish a spouse for bad behavior (such as an affair).Alimony is also not child support. The rationale behind child support is that a parent is financially responsible for his or her children even if the children do not live with that parent. Admittedly, an ex-spouse may financially benefit from child support if the children live with him or her. But the purpose is to allow your children to share in the lifestyle of the non-custodial parent, and child support amounts will be calculated with that end in mind.\nAlimony, by contrast, will be calculated to compensate the spouse for foregoing a career, to rehabilitate her to support herself going forward, and\/or to facilitate the maintenance of a certain lifestyle.;\n, There are many different types of alimony that differ in purpose and duration. Common types of alimony include:\n\n\nTemporary support. A spouse may receive temporary alimony during a divorce, annulment, or legal separation.The ordered alimony is often calculated according to local rules and is less complex than a final order of alimony. It is only in force during the legal separation process and will be superseded by a final order of alimony.\nTransitional alimony. This type of support is mainly short term and applies when the recipient has the capacity to become self-sufficient but requires support while making the adjustment to the economic conditions outside of the marriage. This may include time necessary to obtain educational training.Other states consider support to help obtain an education as \u201crehabilitative support.\u201d\nCompensatory alimony. Though less common, this type of support includes situations where one party made significant contributions to the other party\u2019s overall earning potential.Compensatory spousal support may also be awarded when the dissolution of the marriage leads to one party receiving much more in value without any other property available to offset it for the other party.It is sometimes called \u201creimbursement\u201d alimony.Long-term maintenance. Here, the court usually examines whether the recipient would be unable to reasonably maintain the long-term standard of living established in the marriage on his or her own. If transitional or rehabilitative support alone would not give the recipient the capacity to do so, maintenance support may be awarded.#*This form of support often receives different names in different states. In Tennessee, for example, this type is called alimony in futuro. It is called maintenance support in Oregon.Many states also allow the judge to award more than one type of support at the dissolution of a single marriage. This can lead to the recipient receiving more in the initial months or years after the divorce, and less or none in the long term.\n\n, Alimony will be determined differently according to each state\u2019s laws. Sometimes, states have a statute that lays out a formula used to determine alimony. More typically, state statutes will list factors that a judge will consider when calculating alimony. These factors include: The length of the marriage\nThe income of each spouse (and future earning potential)\nThe age and health of each spouse\nThe standard of living during the marriage\nWhether one spouse made significant contributions to the education or career of the other during the marriage\nWhether one spouse\u2019s career was affected by raising children\nThe assets and debts of each party following the divorce\nDomestic violenceThe tax impact of alimony, Because the laws regarding alimony vary widely between states, it\u2019s important to consult with a family law attorney in your area. The attorney should be familiar with the laws and common judicial decisions made in your state.\n\n\nWith this experience, your attorney may be better able to predict how factors unique to your marriage will affect the amount of the alimony award.\nYou can find attorneys by contacting your state bar association or by asking for recommendations from friends and relatives.\nMake sure to ask any potential candidate for their experience in alimony cases. You can also ask for references. Your attorney will have to ask other clients whether they would be willing to speak with you before giving you any information, however.\nMany states will certify family law specialists. You can look for this certification on the attorney\u2019s website. Alternately, you can seek specialists through your state bar association\u2019s referral list. To become certified, attorneys must have practice family law for many years, pass a written exam, and be recommended by peers or judges.\n\n, Generally speaking, the longer the marriage, the more likely a spouse is to be awarded spousal support. Short-term marriages may not lead to support payments, regardless of other factors.The length of your marriage is important to determining alimony, but the criteria used vary by state. In some states, a marriage legally begins when the marriage certificate is filed with the state and ends when a petition for dissolution is filed. In others, the length of the marriage is measured through the date of physical separation, which could be before or after the official dissolution.\nMany states will also consider a lengthy period of cohabitation that preceded a marriage in the alimony calculation. For example, if a couple lived together before getting married, the court would likely include this period of time in its calculation.\nAs a general rule, the likelihood of court-ordered alimony increases when the length of the marriage exceeds ten years. In some states, as in California, a judge may not set an end date for alimony if the couple has been married over 10 years.A significant amount of alimony is less likely to be awarded for marriages lasting less than ten years. To determine the legal length of your marriage, give your attorney the following information:The dates that you and your spouse lived together as a couple\nThe date you married\nThe date you divorced\nThe date you stopped living together\n\n\n\n, In addition to the length of the marriage, the court will also consider the ability of each spouse to independently support himself or herself when determining alimony.The greater the disparity between incomes, the larger the alimony payments could be.\nThe court may also evaluate the potential income of each spouse. For example, if one spouse has a unique skillset or professional training but is not employed, the court would likely consider the potential income of this spouse rather than actual earnings.\nSimilarly, if one spouse began a higher-paying job immediately after the divorce, the court may decide to base its alimony award on the higher income.\nHow the court chooses to treat an income disparity in the alimony calculation will depend heavily on the precedents set by your state court system.\n\n, Your attorney will want to know the age of each spouse, as well as the state of their health. Age is a particularly important factor when one spouse did not work during the marriage. Compile a list of any health issues or medical expenses that should be included in consideration of alimony.Alimony awards tend to increase with the age of each spouse. This is because older individuals typically have fewer opportunities to re-train or develop new job skills. Younger individuals are more likely to attend a degree program or train for a new career, thus providing a higher income in the future. Younger workers also have a longer time horizon to earn an income.Spouses who have poor employment prospects because of health, disability, or age are more likely to be awarded long-term or permanent alimony.The court will also consider the number of years remaining before an individual is expected to retire. Younger individuals have a longer time period to plan and save for retirement than older individuals, and thus, alimony awards tend to increase with the age of each spouse.\n\n, The amount of alimony awarded should allow each spouse to maintain the same quality of life as under the marital standard of living.Many different expenses are considered part of the marital standard of living, including housing costs, as well as costs for clothing, food, insurance, child care, and other expenses. The amount of alimony awarded should allow each spouse to maintain the same quality of life as under the marital standard of living.\n\n, This consideration often, but not always, applies to female spouses. For example, if one spouse stayed home with children while the other worked, this allowed the other spouse to invest in his\/her career and increase his\/her earning power. Such a condition might be taken into consideration in an alimony decision.Alternately, a situation could have arisen where one spouse worked while the other spouse increased his\/her education level. The working spouse allowed the other to increase his\/her earning potential, perhaps at the working spouse\u2019s expense, and this might be factored into an alimony decision.\n\n, The court will consider the financial situation of each spouse after the divorce is finalized, but before any alimony is awarded. Factor in the net worth of each spouse when trying to anticipate the amount of alimony that may be determined.A significant earning disparity is likely to lead to maintenance support, or spousal support that helps to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage.If the court feels that each spouse is capable of being self-supporting, then alimony payments are less likely to be awarded.\n\n, At current, twenty-nine states factor fault into the calculation of spousal support.While many divorces simply state irreconcilable differences, others do assign responsibility for dissolving the marriage to one (or both) spouses.\n\n\nIf \u201cmarital misconduct\u201d (such as adultery) was cited as a factor in the divorce, the spouse guilty of this misconduct is less likely to be awarded support.Fault works in the opposite direction as well. If the supporting party has a documented history of physical or emotional violence against the recipient, then the supported party is likely to receive a judgment for a larger alimony settlement., To get alimony, you first need to separate from your spouse. You may begin to receive temporary alimony provided there is some physical separation, either because you are going through a divorce, have a restraining order, or for some other reason., You have the option of negotiating with your spouse for alimony. Negotiating a spousal partner agreement may provide more flexibly than you could get from a court order. You should look at the factors that a judge will consider in your state, since alimony agreements must nevertheless be approved by a judge.Negotiated alimony agreements are also part of collaborative divorce. In collaborative divorce, the parties commit to resolving disputes outside the court system through negotiation and mediation. The parties meet with their attorneys, a financial advisor, and possibly a mental health professional (if needed).If you are interested in collaborative divorce, you should seek a collaborative family law attorney. When meeting with attorneys, ask if they practice collaborative family law.\n\n, Before seeking alimony, you should meet with a tax professional to discuss the tax implications of receiving alimony. If you receive alimony, it will count as general income.However, the paying spouse will not withhold taxes, so you will need to plan to make tax payments.The spouse paying maintenance typically can deduct payments on a federal tax return, however there are complicated hurdles you must clear before being able to claim the deduction.You should certainly meet with an accountant or tax professional.\nYou should read IRS publication 504 for more information on what you must do to assure that your alimony payments are tax deductible.Whether or not payments are deductible on your state taxes will be determined by state law, which varies., If you\u2019ve been awarded alimony, be sure to obtain a court order for spousal support. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll have no legal recourse should your ex-spouse stop making payments.This is another reason working with an attorney is important--you\u2019ll need one to file your spousal support agreement and get a court order from the judge.\n\n, If it is allowed in your state, ask the court to issue an order to your ex\u2019s employer to deduct alimony payments from his or her paycheck. The employer will send that money to the court, which will then send you a check in that amount.Arranging for automatic payments eliminates the uncertainty of whether or when your ex will make payments.\nIn some states, such as California, this is called a \"wage assignment\" and it occurs in every child support or alimony case unless you and your ex request otherwise.In many states, this is also known as \"wage garnishment.\" The process of garnishing your ex's wages varies, but in many cases, you need only contact your court or the sheriff's office., In some cases, your ex may temporarily stop making payments due to uncontrollable circumstances, such as losing a job or a medical emergency. If you want to, you can negotiate an agreement with your ex to reduce or suspend the alimony payments until a future date.If you do not come to an agreement, your ex is still responsible to pay the full amount of support unless s\/he seeks temporary relief from the court.In some states, if your ex stops paying alimony, you can ask the court to hold your ex in contempt (or issue an \u201cearnings assignment order\u201d to garnish wages).This may provide incentives for your ex to pay what is owed, such as threatening the possibility of jail time.\n\n, If your ex is significantly delinquent with his\/her alimony, you may be able to place a lien on your ex\u2019s assets. A lien is an assertion of your legal right to property if a person owes you money. Property with a lien notice cannot be sold or refinanced by its owner until the lien is lifted.A lien remains in force until the owner of the property fulfills his\/her obligation to the lien holder.\n\n\nIf your ex fails to make alimony payments, you can request permission from the court to take the asset as payment, or force your ex to sell the property and pay what you are owed with the proceeds.A \u201cQualified Domestic Relations Order\u201d (QRDO) may also be issued. This order will entitle you to part of your ex-spouse\u2019s retirement plans, such as 401Ks, 403Bs, and other ERISA plans (not IRAs). In many cases, unpaid alimony can be taken from your ex\u2019s retirement account., If nothing else has worked, you can file a lawsuit against your ex in small claims court (if the amount owed is beneath a state-determined limit) or in higher court (if the amount exceeds the small claims limit).\n\n\nThis is an unusual procedure, and should be a means of last resort., If the alimony is not for a finite amount of time, it could be paid indefinitely. However, alimony payments will cease when:You reach the date set by the judge for cessation of alimony payments\nThe spouse receiving alimony remarries or enters into a domestic partnership\nYour children no longer need a full-time parent at home\nA judge decides that the partner receiving alimony has not made a sufficient effort to become at least partially self-supporting\nA significant life event (e.g., retirement) occurs and the judge decides to modify alimony payments\nOne party dies\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":788}

It should also be in a place where it won't get buried in a mess that may develop.\n\n, Include a personal-sized bar of soap, new toothbrush and toothpaste, towel and washcloth, disposable razor if needed, some \"relaxing\" clothes (sweats or something similar) and two complete changes of clothes, and anything else you know each person will need during the first few days (while everything else is in boxes). This way everything they'll need is easily attainable.\n\n\nKeep these boxes or suitcases in a safe place where they will not be mixed in with everything else, perhaps in the car or even farther away (work or a neighbor's house). Bring them with you in the car or however you are traveling.\n\n, Instead of buying feet and feet of bubble wrap or handfuls and handfuls of packing peanuts, turn to your clothes to provide that padding. Not only does it save you money, but you have to pack the clothes anyway, so it\u2019s really two birds with one stone. Clothes are often more malleable than paper and bubble wrap, anyway.\n\n\nAs for things like glassware, wrap each one in a sock. It\u2019s almost like that\u2019s what the socks were truly meant for. If they clink against each other, they'll be fine.\n\n, Is there anything you have set up that took you forever to get just right and you\u2019re totally loathing the moment you have to disassemble it? Then snap a photo of it for quick reference later.\n\n\nYou may also want to snap a photo for frame arrangements and decorative set-ups, too. Not to mention the nostalgia and memories, of course.\n\n, You\u2019ll want a nice, wide open space where you can drag and drop all your stuff and then expedite the packing process. This is where you\u2019ll have your boxes, your packing materials, and your pens, tape, and labels. This is your I\u2019m-getting-stuff-done room.\n\n\nAs you pack each box and seal it up, put a number on it, in addition to the room label and contents. This way, if you have X number of boxes, you\u2019ll know when one is missing, in addition to being able to tell the movers just how many boxes you have.\n\n, Wrap each individual item properly with enough layers of wrapping sheets, bubble wrap, or clothes. Place items inside a box with extreme care in the best position possible to avoid damages. Heavier items should be placed on the bottom and lighter items should be placed on the top inside the boxes. Get as many items as possible in each box to cut down on the number of boxes you\u2019ll need.\n\n\nPack heavy items such as books, toys, etc. in small boxes. However, be conscious of not over packing boxes until they are bulky and may break.\nPack fragile or breakable items with extra care and attention. If required, use more layers of wrapping sheets or bubble wraps to wrap such items. Place saran wrap between bottles and caps to prevent leaking. Consider putting cotton between fragile cosmetics, too.\nUse wadded newspapers or crushed papers to fill empty spaces of boxes or cartons.\n\n, This makes unpacking easier once you get where you are going. Start packing one room at a time, packing smaller items first to get them out of the way. Carefully mark and tape each box so you can find everything when you unpack.\n\n\nThis makes it easier for the movers, too. If they're courteous and not on a time crunch, they'll likely take each labeled box and put it in its corresponding room.\n\n, Place all hardware in double-thick Ziploc bags, according to contents and room. Keep all bags in one box with the proper tools \u2013 allen wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, etc. This will make it easier to put everything back together when you have moved in.\n\n\nMake sure you keep the box of hardware and tools in a central place where everyone can find it. This will make re-assembling much easier. Place in it the small things like video ear plugs, remote controls, boxes of nails and things you will need immediately after moving in.\n\n, Toss away junk and only box things that you use. Use your kitchen food storage containers for all loose things you find as you empty drawers from the kitchen, desks, or table drawers throughout the house. Label boxes according to contents and rooms they belong in then securely close or tape them. Use various sized bags for the same purpose. Add a sticky note inside each bag noting the contents like \"stereo cables\" and \"pens and pencils.\u201d Place all containers and bags inside a larger box labeled appropriately with room and content.\n\n\nPlates should be stacked vertically, like records. Don\u2019t forget to look in the dishwasher!\nDo you need anything to stay intact, like necklaces (so they don't get tangled)? Try saran wrap or stretch wrap over them as is and then pack them.\n\n, This most probably will include the items which you have been using until the date of the move. Think about small handy items you might want access to before you unpack all boxes. It may also be useful to add items such as dish soap, a sponge, a roll of paper towels, Kleenex, a couple pens, scissors, plastic\/paper plates\/forks, a bottle opener, bath towels for each family member, one pot, one pan, one plastic stirring utensil, an extra box cutter, etc.\n\n\nKeep in mind that people will need to wash their hands, eat, and shower long before you are done unpacking on the other end of the move. Having this box will make that simple.\nAlso, toss in a sugary treat such as Lifesavers or hard candies in case anyone gets hungry or low blood sugar on move-in day. This is a good way to keep the bad moods at bay.\n\n, Try to keep them stacked in the rooms that you have finished packing. Keep all power strips and extension cords and grounded adapters in one specific box; they will be much easier to find later.\n\n\nClearly label the hardware box and the extension cord box. Consider spray-painting both boxes bright yellow or red.\nPlace all the screws or bolts back into an item after it has been taken apart. This way, you can connect the bed or put the lampshade back on immediately instead of searching for them.\n\n, Do you know where each one is? Are any in need of any extra tape job? Do you have more than you thought you might and need to inform the movers that you'll need a bigger truck?\n\n\nWhich ones are fragile and which ones are sturdy? Are there any that you want to handle yourself, just in case? You may wish to set a few aside so you know where they're at at all times.\n\n, Place any last minute items together in one room. Remember: when the truck has been filled, and the movers tell you that they have everything, checking out each room to make sure that nothing has been left behind is your responsibility. When you are certain that each room is clean, then it is time to shut the door and leave!\n\n, Pro movers specialize in getting everything safely and efficiently from one house to the other. The do not specialize in separating your good china from the bad, not rounding up all of the dirty laundry on the floor. They will ask you to be cleaned and organized before they arrive. Good ideas include;\n\n\nGrouping similar small items in boxes (books, dishes, etc.)\nClearly designating valuable and fragile goods\nThrowing out and purging excess stuff in advance.\nLabeling boxes with final locations., Good movers are methodical. They keep everything in similar places, packing you up room by room. While they may mix things up to make sure everything fits well, they are practiced in the most convenient way to get things in and out of their truck. Expect them to work much more efficiently than you might on your own.\n\n, One of the chief benefits of a moving team is that they know how to handle the bunk beds stuck in the kids' room. Professionals will take down the furniture into the most convenient, easily transported parts, pad the pieces safely, and put everything back together when you arrive.\n\n\nSince most movers are paid hourly, feel free to assemble or break down furniture by yourself if you feel confident in your abilities. You'll save some money., Things break when they are allowed to move around in the truck, bouncing off other objects. A good mover understands that packing tightly isn't just about saving space, it is about a snug, tight fit. They will:\n\n\nUse packing peanuts to fill empty space.\nWrap furniture and large pieces in heavy blankets to prevent sliding or moving.\nGroup square and rectangular objects, which can be jammed close together, in the same box., A professional makes their living off of transporting your things and has the wherewithal and knowledge needed to prevent accidents. That said, in the case that something does happen, professional movers have the responsibility to pay you back for any damages incurred.\n\n\nHiring a professional insures the past possible pack job, and then insures you further if something bad happens.\nAlways ask about the contract before signing-- some smaller companies may try to get out of responsibility for damages if you aren't careful. You may need to pay for warranty.\n\n, A professional mover should keep a log of every box and item, allowing them to prove that they got everything safely to your new location. This sort of double-checking is crucial, especially on big or complicated (multi-truck, cross-country, etc.) moves.\n\n\nIf the moving company does not inventory your items, you should.\n\n, This can vary, but it is a good baseline when thinking about rates and how many movers you need. It takes two movers roughly 5 hours to completely pack a 1,000sq foot house (500ft per mover). Thus:\n\n\nWith 4 movers, a 3,000ft house would like 13 hours.\nWith 3 movers, a 2,000ft house would take 10-12 hours.\nWith 6 movers, a 4,000ft+ house would take 15 hours or more., Maybe you want to save money and just have someone help with the heavy lifting. You can pre-pack the boxes. Maybe you want someone to do everything for you with a bit of guidance. You can pay for the movers to wrap and protect all your goods. Professionals are there to serve you, and will do the work that you need to be done. Expect a professional mover to ask a lot of questions about your exact needs.Movers will appreciate your direction and guidance as long as it saves things from breaking or getting lost.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":790}
{"text":" Toads love cool and damp places like that. Toads are like tan colored frogs, but they have bumpy skin. The large brown wart behind each eye tastes bad if bitten, so that makes animals not want to eat toads. Toads eat small insects, like mosquitoes, and come out at night. Toads will try to scare you if you pick them up, they will pee on you!\n\n, Now look for a horizontal web with a funnel in one corner. Funnel spiders in the US are not dangerous. Funnel spiders in Australia are! This is where the female spider hides during the day. She comes out in the evening when the light is dim and eats insects that fall in the web. Male funnel web spiders do not spin webs and wander around your yard eating things like mosquitoes. Funnel spiders look somewhat fuzzy, are light tan, with darker stripes on the back.\n\n, Look for a circular web shaped like a bulls eye. Orb weaver spiders make these webs. At sunrise the webs collect dew and are easily seen.\n\n, Caterpillars are baby butterflies or moths. They eat plants. What color is it? Some caterpillars get quite large, up to 8\u201310 inches (20.3\u201325.4\u00a0cm) long, like tomato hornworms. If you have tomato plants in your yard, you will probably have tomato hornworm caterpillars. Hornworms have a little horn on their rear end.\n\n, Look for a little pile of droppings in the evening. Now look to the leaf right above the droppings, under the leaf. Is he there?\n\n, Ant lions are also called \"doodle bugs\". The ant lion waits for an ant to fall into the funnel, then he throws sand at the ant to make it fall down to the base. When the ant gets to the bottom, the ant lion drags him under the sand. Don't worry, there are plenty of ants left.\n\n, In general, moths have feathery antennas, and butterflies have thin, smooth antennas. Butterflies love: purple coneflowers, butterfly weed, butterfly bush, and other flowers that have lots of nectar. Do not touch the butterfly, you are a giant to them and you could easily damage their wings.\n\n, Bees also like the nectar from the same flowers as butterflies. There are many kinds of bees, including honey bees, larger bumblebees, and even larger carpenter bees. Honey bees are just a little fuzzy with a yellow\/gold abdomen. Bumble bees are very fuzzy with black and yellow. Honey bees gather pollen on their legs and use it to make honey in their hive.\n\n, You will often find them together. Do not touch the wasps, they can sting if they get scared. Wasps come in many colors too. The yellow-jackets are yellow and black. Steel blue cricket killers are an iridescent black\/blue. The cuckoo wasp is a metallic green. Wasps in the US range from very tiny 1\u20444 inch (0.6\u00a0cm), to 4 inch (10.2\u00a0cm) long cicada killers (they do sting), to 6 inch (15.2\u00a0cm) long megarhyssa. The megarhyssa has a 3\" body, 3\" egg tube, but no stinger.\n\n, There are several bugs you might find here.\n\n, You can pick one up. It might crawl on you and tickle you, or it might roll into a ball. Gently poke it to make it roll into a ball. After a minute (be real still) it will unroll and wander around in your hand. Pill bugs eat dead wood or dead leaves.\n\n, They are safe to pick up, but are messy. They have 2-4 antennas which are their eyes. They leave a slime trail wherever they go. They need a damp place to live.\n\n, They eat dead leaves also.\n\n, The common centipede is a golden color, flat, and has many legs that stick way out from its side.\n\n, They look like a tube with legs going straight up and down. They are not flat. You can catch them, but they will probably freeze. If you hold real still and do not breathe on them they might start moving again.\n\n, There are many sizes of ants, from the tiny brown sugar ants, commonly found between your sidewalk cracks (which also appear in your kitchen looking for sugary foods), to larger carpenter ants which eat wood.\n\n, They eat other bugs and are called \"shield bugs\".\n\n, Japanese beetles are smaller beetles and have iridescent, metallic green and yellow colors. June beetles are a dark brown. They do not bite, and are slow moving. They can fly and they might try to fly away if you pick them up!\n\n, You should get a heavy duty minnow net with a 5 foot (1.5\u00a0m) handle so your teacher can scrape the bottom of the pond or stream.;\n, Make good contact with the bottom the whole time then quickly bring up the net so nothing swims out of it.\n\n, Crayfish can really hurt if they pinch you, you must be specially trained to pick up an adult crayfish. If the crayfish is under an inch it should not be able to pinch you. Crayfish eat dead and dying plants and animals on the bottom of the stream. Crayfish have many names like: crawfish, clawfish, mudbug, and others.\n\n, They eat things that are smaller than themselves. There are too many types of minnows to name. but if the adult is less then 4 inches (10.2\u00a0cm) long, it's probably a minnow. In the spring they swarm by the hundreds or thousands in the same place to lay eggs.\n\n, They look like skinny sticks with legs. Some have a breathing tube as their tail, which they poke above the water to breathe. If you catch one in a net it is safe to pick them up GENTLY by the breathing tube. Don't get near their mouth, they will bite if scared! They eat anything that swims by.\n\n, Toad tadpoles, or \"toadpoles\", are solid black and the smallest of the bunch. Frog tadpoles are always shades of green and tan. Bullfrog tadpoles can take up to 2 years to turn into a frog, and they are the biggest of them all! The head and tail can measure 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm)!\n\n, Pick it up by the sides so it doesn't bite you. It is also called a \"toe biter\" because sometimes swimmers step on them, they get scared, and bite the person on the toe. The bite is not dangerous but it sure hurts! Giant water bugs can fly. They come out at night and can be found below porch lamps there were turned on at night. They can also be found after they land in a pool, or land on a car windshield because it looks like water. In some countries, like India, the giant water bug is called a \"water scorpion\".\n\n, Mosquito larva are worm-shaped, but have to breathe air. If they feel someone walking buy, or see a moving shadow, they will wiggle themselves in an \"S\" shape to the bottom of the pool. Wigglers can be found in almost any standing water. Adult midges look just like mosquitoes but midges do not bite. Larva get to 1\u20442 inch (1.3\u00a0cm) long at most. Mosquito larva that look like a comma will hatch into adults within 24 hours.\n\n, They are called \"glass\" shrimp because they are clear. Their stomach is at the top of their back, behind their eyes, and you can see what he ate. They are also called \"ghost shrimp\".\n\n, They are also called \"tadpole shrimp\". They have short life spans, about 6-8 weeks. They look like tiny 1\u20132 inch (2.5\u20135.1\u00a0cm) long horseshoe crabs. Their eggs survive drying, so they are sold in hobby stores. The triops got its name because it has 3 eyes, although you can see only 2. The shape of its eyes make it look mad, but it is safe to pick up. It may flop around in your hand and tickle you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":791}
{"text":" This is a list that usually consists of the following: each player's name, age or date of birth, uniform size, if they have played on a team before, preferred position, name and phone numbers of parents\/guardians (if they are younger than 18).;\n, You may need to ask your league's soccer commissioner for this information, check the league's website, or contact another coach responsible for the same age group as you. This information is crucial when planning the difficulty and frequency of practices.\n\n, Some leagues do this for you. Contact other coaches who coach at the same level and age group as you to ask how often their teams practice if you're unsure.\n\n\nAt some point you should be able to decide this based on your own understanding of the mechanics of your players and when they need practice versus when they need breaks.\nTry to maintain at least two soccer practices per week. High level teams with older players sometimes increase this to four or even five practices. It is your decision how often and long you should hold practices. It is important to manage this with when the soccer fields are free.\n\n, You may have to contact the league commissioner for this, however all leagues are different. Sometimes you have to contact a county run office, for example the county recreation department office. Generally a league commissioner will have notified you how to do this when you signed up for coaching for their league.\n\n, Having some form of online presence is greatly encouraged as it gives players a way to contact each other if other methods fail. Post upcoming games, practices, as well as the entire soccer schedule and be sure to add reminders for their upcoming games.\n\n, Most coaches find that the best way to notify players is through group email. That said, some coaches find that calling each player works best.\n\n, For older players this is probably pretty self-explanatory, however new players need to understand what to bring and wear.\n\n\nThey need to be equipped with cleats, long socks over shinguards, and bottled water. It is up to you to decide if they need anything else after preparing a full practice plan.\nYou can post this information on the internet, and\/or explain it in the email, text, or phone call.\n\n, This also depends on the practice you choose to drill, however there are some basic things every coach tends to bring.\n\n\nRemember to bring soccer balls, cones, several full water bottles, coloured bibs, clipboard with practice plan as well as roster, paper, pencil\/pen and any handouts you choose to give players or parents.\nSometimes a drill may require a 'ladder', a flat ladder-shaped agility obstacle. If you choose to bring this, try to keep it untangled.\nIn addition, mini soccer goals are occasionally provided by coaches when training on a field without them. If you decide to purchase some, look for some that wrap and compress easily.\n\n, For first time soccer practices, it can be important to prepare a handout with league rules for games and general behavior. Also include your own rules for practice, your phone numbers, telephone number of your supervisor and the number to call to see if games have been cancelled. Also consider adding information about contacting you to get more involved both as players and parents.\n\n\nEncouraging activities such as carpooling, after-game dinners, and possibly even snacks (for younger age groups) will both encourage players to get more involved as well as bring your team closer together. The closer your team is, the more likely you are to see good teamwork on the field.\n\n, It is important to have a clear understanding of your teams weaknesses and faults before planning a large practice. Many leagues have a tryout date at which you can observe and take notes on players' abilities. If not, consider having your next practice be purely for evaluation purposes and have them do some very clean cut and stark drills (i.e. running sprints, long distance, and basic drills).\n\n, Depending on how you coach and their ages, you may not need to assign specific positions. At an early age, a player should be more focused on developing their skill everywhere rather than one specific position.\n\n\nThat said, with older teams it is important to pick out one or two goalkeepers. These players need to be dedicated and hard working. Some coaches choose to bring in specialists or assistant coaches to coach them separately, but bring them back in occasionally for scrimmages and exercises to keep the flow of teamwork.\n\n, Keep players hydrated, it's important to keep them playing at their best.\n\n, This is usually a pulse raiser, or a drill specifically designed to gradually increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles. This can be as simple as running laps, or you could include a small circuit of exercises. Try to limit this to a simple 5-10 minutes.\n\n\nFor youth teams, fun activities such as stuck in the mud are good.\n\n, This stretches out joints and can make exercise more comfortable. Stretches such as lunges, side steps, high kicks and windmill arms are great for this. That said, your pre-practice stretches shouldn't consume too much time.\n\n, This gets the body back into soccer mode and your muscles get to remember how to perform the basics again. Make the players do some exercises such as these:\n\n\nShort and long passing in pairs or small groups.\nQuick shooting practice.\nAgain, for youth teams this could be made into a game. For example, seeing which pair can make the most passes or hit the target the most in a certain time period.\n\n, This should raise the players' heart rate to 60-80% of their maximum heart rate. This helps to develop their cardiovascular endurance. Fitness needs to be constantly maintained so that players are at match fitness throughout the season.\n\n\nFartlek training is possibly the best training method for soccer. The mixture of intensities and terrain simulates match situations.\n\n, If you want to go through set pieces, new tactics or just maintain the team's skill level, this is the part of the session to do it in.\n\n, This gives the players a chance to put any new skills or tactics they have learned into practice and helps develop muscle memory. If the players are tired and weary, let them rest before playing the game. Adding a game is optional.\n\n, This gradually returns the body to its normal state and disperses excess lactic acid, reducing stiffness and muscle soreness. This is often consists of a light jog around the pitch, then slowing into a walk before sitting down with straight, stretched legs.\n\n, This helps stretch out your joints and is good for relieving stress after a hard session.\n\n, After practice is when everyone should be quiet, refueling, and listening to you. Lots of coaches use this time as an opportunity to review practice and remind players what to do outside practice.\n\n, It's important to remind them to stretch, practice and stay active in general. Never ridicule specific players, but feel free to compliment any players you think did exceptionally well, or the ones who could use some encouragement. It's important to switch up the players you call out to avoid a teacher's pet situation.\n\n, It's important to have some handouts ready for players and\/or parents to let them know what happens next. Be sure to announce the next practice time and offer yourself to answer anybody's questions or concerns.\n\n, This is simple coaching etiquette and simply shows you care. For lower age groups, it's also a safety matter. Wait for your players to either get home by themselves or have their parents take them home.\n\n, Phone calls and SMS may be a little bit heavy handed for this, but it's good to let players know what they need to work on once again in an email and on your team's online presence.\n\n\nIf you've got the time, shooting emails out to individual players is a good idea, too. Remember, however, anything you email a player can be shared with other players. The goal is to provide an open and positive community within your team.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":792}

If there are any rips or tears, you will need to sew them back up.\n\n, This will help things balanced inside the washer.If you are unable to fit the pillows in the drum, squeeze them first to get the air out.Try not to use a top-loading washer, as the agitator may damage the pillows. If you do not have a front-loading washer, consider visiting a Laundromat; they should have one available that you can use.If you must use a top-loading washing machine, put the pillows in vertically instead of horizontally. That way, they won't get tangled in the agitator., This will prevent any buildup or residue. Also, try to use liquid detergent instead of powder one. Powder detergent is more likely to cause buildup and residue.This can lead to skin irritations and allergies. Pillows are bulky, so they do not rinse out well. The less soap you use, the less you will have to rinse them.\n\n, If you can, try to use hot water. This will help kill any dust mites that might be living inside your pillow.Keep in mind, however, that hot water may also damage the feathers. If you are worried about this, use warm or cool water instead., This will help get any soap residue out. The extra spin cycle will help get rid of any excess moisture.\n\n, Place the pillow between two towels, and press down on it. The towels will help soak up any extra water. Repeat this step for the other pillow. Do not wring or twist the pillows., Use a delicate cycle, with either a low-heat or no-heat setting. Using low-heat will help the pillows dry faster, but it may damage the feathers inside. Using the no-heat or air-only cycle may take longer (and two to three cycles), but it will be the safest for the feathers.Be sure to fluff the pillow between cycles. Do this by taking it out of the dryer and beating it. This will also help break up any clumps inside the pillow.\nIf you are using a low-heat setting, consider using the air-only setting towards the end of the cycle.

{"text":" By shopping around at several mortgage lenders, you can determine which ones offer the best interest rates.Finding the lowest rate can save you significant amounts of money over the term of the mortgage.\n\n\nYou may be able to get a general sense of mortgage rates in your area by using online tools offered by real estate websites, banks, or other lenders.However, to get a specific quote, you will need to contact or visit lenders.;\n, If interest rates change, your rate will change. A rate lock, however, is a legally binding promise (qualified by any special terms) that you will get a specified rate from a lender.\n\n, This means that a varying number of \u201cpoints\u201d are charged depending on the conditions of the rate lock. These points translate into different fees. For instance:\n\n\nIn many cases, it is free to lock in a rate for up to 30 days (in some cases, up to 45 days).\nTypically, rate locks are guaranteed thereafter in 30-day increments, with higher fees for longer terms. A 90-day rate lock, for example, will cost more than a 60-day rate lock; a 120-day rate lock will cost more than a 90-day one.\nOne point equals one percent of the loan amount., While locking in a mortgage rate can protect you against interest rate hikes, it can also prevent you from benefiting if interest rates fall.Some lenders, however, offer a mortgage rate lock float down, which allows you to make a one-time decision to exchange your locked-in rate for a lower one.Thus, it can be in your best interest to find a lender which offers this possibility.\n\n, Some lenders require a clause in mortgage rate lock agreements that allows the quoted rate to rise by a certain limited amount if interest rates rise before you close on a house. This is known as a rate cap.Even with a rate cap, a mortgage rate lock agreement offers you some protection from rising interest rates. However, by shopping around for interest rates you will determine the best agreement terms, and find out if any lenders do not require a rate cap.\n\n, There can be considerable pressure to do this as soon as possible. However, this isn\u2019t always the best idea.\n\n\nIn some cases, mortgage rates might fall. Talk to your realtor or another knowledgeable individual about current trends and expectations for rate activity.\nSome lenders charge a rate lock deposit, which you may or may not want to or be able to pay.\nSome lenders will lock in your mortgage rate at a slightly higher rate than the current rate. This allows you to continue to shop for a home while avoiding a rise in interest rates. However, if it turns out you did not need to lock in your rate, you will end up being charged more than was necessary.\n\n, If you decide that you do not want to seek a mortgage rate lock from a lender, then the rate will \u201cfloat.\u201d This means that your rate will be set at whatever the prevailing rate is shortly before your scheduled closing date., Once you have decided on the best lender and\/or interest rate, request to see a blank copy of the lender\u2019s rate lock form, if possible. This will give you an exact sense of what to expect before submitting your own application. If you have time, you can have the blank form looked at by your realtor and\/or real estate lawyer for approval.,\n\n\nRate lock fees can be several hundred dollars. In many cases, a rate lock fee might be refunded, unless your mortgage application is canceled.\n\n, Depending upon the institution, you may have several ways to make the request (phone, fax, in-person visit, etc.). However you initially contact the institution, it is important to get the request in writing.Send a document that specifies the rate you would like to lock your mortgage in at, and any applicable points or other terms. Make sure that your request is signed and dated by you and any co-borrowers.\n\n\nMost lenders will connect you with a mortgage consultant or office to contact when you are ready to request your rate.\nYour realtor or real estate attorney can help you in preparing this request.\nWhen sending your request, make sure that you have completed any application and made any deposit your lender requires to get a mortgage.\n\n, Your lender should send you a letter confirming your request for a rate lock within a specified period (usually a brief one, such as 5 days).If your request is approved, you should get a written confirmation from your lender. Make sure that the confirmation displays:The agreed-upon rate\nWhether or not the rate is guaranteed\nThe property address\nThe loan amount and program (i.e., the mortgage period)\nThe lock in fee\nThe lock in date\nThe lock in expiration date\nAny special terms or conditions\nThe lender\u2019s and borrower\u2019s signatures\n\n, In certain situations, you can re-negotiate the rate lock terms; in others, you will either have to accept the new rate or seek a new mortgage. For example:\n\n\nIf rates change in between making a lock in request and its approval, the original request will be void. You will then have to re-negotiate the request, if desired.\nIf you change the kind of loan you are requesting, or the terms of the loan (for example, the amount of your down payment), your rate can change.\nYour rates can also change if your credit score rises or falls during or after the process of making the rate lock request.\nIf your income cannot be verified, lenders may not be able to honor a rate guarantee.\nA change in the appraised value of the home you are seeking to buy can also result in a change to your rate.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":796}

Anyway attack the wall by doing keep on doing it until you destroyed the way you can build up combos with this one too. Remember to do the next one only after the Patapons have finished singing. After you have destroyed the wall do your victory dance by keep on doing Pon Pon Pata Pon four more times in a row after that move on forward with Pata Pata Pata Pon. when you get near the totem pole you will notice that it has symbols but you can't do anything there at the moment so keep on going. if you see enemies like birds and other things don\u2019t stop to close because less advantage for you. attack and try to kill them if you can, sometimes helps if you're in a fever (10 combo points). you do more damage in a fever. the birds you see do run away easily.\nYou can get combos by doing Pata Pata Pata Pon, and then doing Pon Pon Pata Pon, it doesn\u2019t have to be the same one each time. The more combo points you have the more damage you do. You can get coins from the sunflowers and enemies if they get destroyed while you\u2019re attacking. Move over the coins to collect them. All the enemies on this level run away and don\u2019t attack so don\u2019t be afraid to attack them. Keep moving forward and attacking to get to the flag pillar and the end of the mission. Mission Complete!\nOn the mission complete screen you will see the Patapons carrying on carts the beasts you killed back to their home.\nAnother information screen will pop up.\n\n, Talk to the Patapon with the cloak that is standing next to what looks like a shrine. Click on the shrine and this will take you to a screen with the items you have collected like how many spears you have and how much food you have from the beasts you have killed and lots more. Also how many coins you have is on the top right. Press to go back.

The 4 Zigotron behind the wall will move right behind the next wall what is next to another wall. A Patapon with a sword and shield will come out of the bush and join your group. Destroy the next wall will your group (your new Patapon is very strong). While destroying the walls watch out for enemy Zigotron. Just keep on moving right destroying the walls and the enemy and collecting the items as you go. Destroy the small black pillar then the small house. After that your new Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly. Pick the items it drops and go through the end of level flag. Mission Complete!\n\n, When you select it, a menu opens up showing the Patapons you can make, how much you have all together, how much it cost to make a specific Patapon, and what items are need e.g. to make a spear Patapon you need meat, wood, and 80 coins. The circles show how many of each Patapon you already have., You need to press circle in time to make the tree shake and drop an item. If you fail you can try again but you need to give one piece of meat again. when you hear the person go for example Pon Pon Pon when he finishes you press circle, circle, circle and so on. Listen to what the person says, if it says four words you have to press the circle button four times but you have to do it in the same tempo as the singer. Once you done that you will get the items you need (wood).\nThe sequence is: O\/O\/O O\/O\/O O\/O\/OO O\/O\/OO O\/OO\/OO O\/OO\/OO O\/O\/O O\/O\/OO\nIf you get stuck just talk to the Patapon with a cape.\nYou have to pass the tree mini-game so if you fail it and don\u2019t have any meat you have to play a previous level to collect some meat. You will know that the level contains meat because it will have a meat symbol on the world map. So play the level with the meat symbol and get some meat by killing beasts and completing the level. In this game it\u2019s good to play over the old levels and a lot of the time is required.\nOnce you have passed and got a branch, make a spear Patapon, you will notice that it is all orange. Then make sure it\u2019s on your team then play the second square on the world map.\n\n, You will have to fight lots of Zigotron now, there not that hard if you have an axe Patapon because it will go up front and take all the damage while you\u2019re attacking with your spear throwers behind. this is probably be the first time you get a proper fever going and maybe the first time a Patapon dies none did for me though. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy and trying to keep the combos going till you get to the end. Destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!\nRemember to upgrade your Patapons with better weapons when you can.\n\n, Destroy the first wall, then take out the tower, watch out for the archers on the tower and the other Zigotron patrolling below it once they're all dead and building destroyed a Patapon archer will appear. for the next bit do the same tactic as before and destroy the wall, tower, house and the next tower if you see a green potion pick it up, it restores your Patapons life. If you get fever going it won\u2019t take long to kill them all. The archer you got fires fire arrows which can set the Zigotron a light this makes them run around and not fight back. After you they're all dead and buildings destroyed, move forward. Destroy the black pillar. When you get near the house the bow Patapon will die and turn into a butterfly pick up the items it drops, destroy the building and go through the flag. Mission complete!\nYou can now make archers.\n\n, This level might be hard if you\u2019re not prepared because of the tough grim reaper type Zigotron you face, it keeps on attacking you with tornadoes which make your Patapons jump in the air and get hurt. In the middle is a Patapon trapped in a cage; you need to save him too so make sure you don\u2019t kill him by accident. Keep on moving forward and attacking the enemy, having fever is very helpful and picking up green potions. Your probably won't are able to kill the boss here because it will probably run away from you. Mission complete!\nTo defeat the boss coming up you will need a lot of Patapons so do the second square, the one with the meat icon a few times to build up a bigger squad and use the best equipment you have available. Also do the tree mini game if you need more wood.\n\n,\nGo forward and destroy the pillar. You will get a new drum Chaka and a new sequence Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Does the new sequence a few times, when ready keep moving forward. When the fire breathing dragon comes use Chaka Chaka Pata Pon each time, this makes you defend and attack. Only the Patapons with shields defend. If Patapons die make sure you pick up there helmets and just keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. It isn\u2019t that hard if you got the most Patapons you can get at the moment. I had 11 Patapons, 3 axes, 6 spears and 1 archer.\nIf any Patapons died, make sure you reborn them when you get back to your village. You do this by going to the heart shaped tree.\n\n, If you go past it, you will start burning and dying very quickly because of the extreme heat of the desert. You will need something to cool it down., I don\u2019t know if it needs to be raining for it to work., Basically the same as the last boss fight but a bit harder. Keep on attacking with Chaka Chaka Pata Pon. Your Patapons might get eaten so watch out for that. Keep attacking if your entire shields Patapons die then attack using Pon Pon Pata Pon. Keep at it and it should die eventually. The boss dragon drops a rain item.\n\n,\nNew Sequence: = miracle\nVoice: Don DoDon DoDon\nDo the rain miracle at the start. You have to be in fever to do it. If you can\u2019t do it, practice a lot. After that move forward to the tower. Destroy the tower then keep moving forward. You will see beasts that you can attack also one will have a blue symbol on it, if you attack that one it will turn into a snail. When you get tot he talking sign destroy the rock in front and get fever. Once the rock in front is destroyed use rain miracle then move forward and destroy the rocks and keep on moving forward. you need to try to keep fever going so you can use the rain miracle straight away or if you move forward really quickly and destroying the rocks as you go you can get out the desert with only doing the rain miracle once but you will lose a lot of Patapons this way so make sure you pick up the helmets they drop. Keep going forward destroy the building at the end and go through the flagpole.\n\n,, They will attack in groups and each group has two zigotrons on horses. This levels isn\u2019t that hard if you use all the things you have learned so far like knowing when to attack and charge or when to hold your ground. When they are near most of the time its best to use the defend command. When they are not near use the attack command. Make sure you try to stay in fever for most of the time because this will help you do more damage. Make sure you pick up the green potions they drop. When you get near the end you will see zigotrons hiding in the bushes. Also near the end lots of them will attack if you are in fever and you use the attack command they will run away and retreat. So you don\u2019t have to kill all of them near the end. Destroy the building then go through the flagpole.,, Do the rain miracle at the start. Move forward and you will see a blue beast, hit it and it will turn into a snail now all you have to do is kill the snail. Make sure you are in fever mode most of the time and keep on attacking. If it gets to far make sure you move forward with it and keep on attacking. When it dies it will drop a hat pick it up and go through the flagpole at the end., You will now have a new mini game. You can select the new mini game by pressing to get to it.,, When the game starts keep on pressing in time with the flashing sides or at a steady pace. While you do this the farmer will plant flowers, water flowers and do stuff with the big flower when this is done the big flower will talk to you. This is to allow you to get ready for the next bit. When your farmer is holding a leaf over its head, keep on pressing fast and if done right the farmer will catch a big cabbage. Well done you have completed the flower mini game., Make sure you have lots of Patapons with good equipment. This boss fight can be hard but if you have lots of Patapons it isn\u2019t as hard, the boss does three attacks. A fire attack when it breaths in air. A head attack when it raises its head and a ground attack when it lies on the ground. When the boss is about to do an attack do the defend command then after that do the attack command. If you keep in fever most of the time and defend when it attacks and attack when it isn\u2019t then you can beat it quite easy. When its eyes start to flash that means its going to die soon.,,, horse squad for the archer squad etc., Also you need to watch out for the zigotron army who are out in force to stop you. They are quite easy to defeat if you make sure your Patapons are up to the job and you have quite a lot of them. Make sure to remember all the tactics you have learned and use them in battle.,, You will see a zigotron that looks like a grim reaper. You don\u2019t have to kill it. All you need to do is kill all the zigotron that are hiding in the bushes. The easiest way is to get fever going and keep on attacking. A big zigotron will come and attack in the middle of the battle but is easy to kill. After there all dead the grim reaper zigotron will retreat so all is left to do is go through the flagpole. If you fail the first time try again and you\u2019re more likely to complete it.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":797}
{"text":"\n\n\nAt no point during your entire performance is your partner allowed to touch you. You can touch, lick, rub and caress him all you want but play it cool. A slow seduction is a sure recipe for lap dancing success. The whole point of a lap dance is to drive your partner crazy with anticipation and desire.\nYou are in charge. Take your time, take control, and take pleasure in teasing them.\nIf they reach out in your direction or starts to grind back, slap their wrist and let them know that if they do it again, the dance is over, no exceptions.;\n, You won\u2019t look sexy if you don\u2019t feel sexy. Accept and enjoy yourself regardless of your shape or size. Any woman can perform a great striptease or lap dance regardless of whether they\u2019re shy or feel their body is not the \"perfect shape\". It\u2019s all about attitude. Not all lap dancers have supermodel figures, they just behave like they do. This is your time to be seductive, to nurture and release your sensual spirit. Drop your inhibitions and throw caution to the wind. You are a sexy goddess.\n\n, There\u2019s a wide variety to choose from. From erotic dance-wear to bras, panties, garter-belts, stockings, chemises, robes, teddies, swimsuits, club-wear, fetish-wear, over-sized button-up shirts and so much more. The key is to build up a collection of layers that are easy to remove. Be daring, you\u2019re performing a tease, so a bit of flesh is essential.\n\n\nStart by selecting underwear first as these items will be the last to come off. A sexy bra, g-string, stockings (stay-ups are easier to work with) and perhaps suspenders.\nPanties should frame your cheeks while the back of your panties should reach too high over your cheeks. Try full bottomed panties, thongs, g-strings and booty shorts to see which works best for you. Panties that leave lines on your body after you take them off are probably too tight and should be avoided.\nThigh high stockings worn with or without garters are a sexy addition to almost any outfit. Try a pair that\u2019s one size smaller for sexier movement. If you plan to keep your stockings and garter on for the duration of your dance, wear your panties on the outside of the straps so that they can be removed without having to unhook your garters.\nFor the top layers, try little hot pants, an innocent sheer robe, sexy high-school teacher\/student uniform, be a dominatrix, a desperate housewife or for something different, a classic red or black evening dress with some retro lingerie underneath.\nAvoid corsets or clothing that\u2019s too tight and difficult to slip out of. Clothing with zips at the back or many straps that take time to put on will of course be difficult to remove.\nFor shoes, high heels and stilettos usually work best with any outfit. They make your legs look toned, sleek, and longer. Even if they\u2019re slightly uncomfortable, give them a try because you won\u2019t be wearing them for long anyway. If you can\u2019t walk in heels, rather wear something you\u2019re comfortable in. If all else fails in the shoe department, go barefoot and try the Barefoot Strut.\nRemove as much as you are comfortable with. You may choose to end up totally nude, topless, in sexy lingerie, a lacy gown or remain fully clothed. Your lover however must remain fully clothed.\nIf your choose shoes with buckles, consider how you\u2019ll remove your clothing without taking off your shoes. Stretchy clothing or flowing dresses can be taken off over your shoes, but check first. If all else fails in the shoe department, the bare-foot stripper strut (on your tip toes) is also very hot.\nIf you\u2019re doing it in heels, don\u2019t take them off (except to remove stockings - or better yet, keep your stockings on). Perhaps put the heels back on once the stockings are off. Strapless shoes can be removed more gracefully than shoes with straps or buckles.\nIf you chose something that needs to be removed by slipping it over your head, seductively slip it off by pulling it from the bottom on the sides while standing up tall, don't hunch over.\nA shirt with buttons can be a very sexy item of clothing to remove. Play peek-a-boob with each side. When you\u2019ve undone the last button, turn around posing at an angle, expose your one shoulder then the other and then let is slip down to the floor.\nTight trousers or jeans can be difficult to remove. A pencil skirt can easily be unzipped and pushed down Do this while bending forward with your back or side to him and then step out of it. Skirts can be removed with your shoes and stockings on.\nPractice removing your stockings ahead of time. For extra balance (and teasing), place your toes between his legs or on the arm of his chair while you push each stocking down - or slowly roll or fold them down the length of your leg.\nDon\u2019t forget to tease. For beginners, take your time with each layer. Pull your skirt up or your underwear down a few inches before removing. Tuck a thumb or two into the sides of your trousers, skirt or underwear, lower the item of clothing slightly and tease.\nPush your bra straps off your shoulders before turning away to unclasp. A classic stripper routine is to hold the bra against your breasts, turn around with your back towards your man and drop your bra on the floor or, when standing with your back to him, hold your bra by the straps above your head before dropping it onto the floor. Keep the heat up by keeping your arm and hand over your breasts then slowly turn around and slide your hand across and away from your breasts for a sexy reveal.\nWhen taking your bottoms off, try slipping them off over your shoes or bare feet while standing straight-legged. Do this by bending over from the waist and guiding them off all the way to the floor and then stepping out of them. If this isn't easy for you, try bending your knees or taking your bottoms off while lying on your back. Don\u2019t squat down too low\u2026\nDon\u2019t get completely naked until the very end \u2014 and even then, tease him with a back view until he can\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n, Think smooth and seductive. Avoid songs with high pitched vocals. The crooners and divas of the 60s are a good place to start if you want something romantic. A sensual rhythm or beat will guide you through your dance. It's best if you can relate to the music and feel comfortable moving to its beat. Start by setting aside 2 or 3 songs.\n\n\nSong one is for the warm-up. This is your time to lead your partner to the chair, strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.\n\n, Take your time, start when you're ready, walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat.\n\n, You\u2019re free to decide, short \u2018n sweet or long & languishing. You'll probably find yourself deep in the throes of passion by the end of it so consider choosing a dozen songs and enjoy the fun at the end.\n\n\nIf possible, burn all the songs onto a CD or set them as a play-list on your portable music player. Don\u2019t stop to change CDs.\n\n, Close your eyes, feel the music, enter the trance and begin to sway.\n\n\nTry setting aside 30 minutes or so a day before to get familiar with your clothes, your body, the poses and the moves. Dance on your feet and on the floor. These may be things you\u2019ve never done before. Try sliding down a wall and then back up. Walk around on the tips of your toes.\nOn the floor, try opening and closing your legs or leaning your knees from one side to the other. Experiment with different angles. Sit on a chair. Caress your thighs, your neck, your belly your feet. Close your legs and then open them using your hands to part your thighs. Re-discover your body. Close your eyes if you\u2019re shy.\nIf you feel uncomfortable \u2018dancing\u2019 think of your performance as a slow aerobics session. Stretch, bend, split. Use your hands, stretch them out to the sides, and stroke your outstretched arm with the tips of your fingers. If you\u2019ve practiced martial arts, yoga or Pilates, modify the posses that you\u2019re familiar with to create your very own sexy moves.\nThink of your dance as a T'ai Chi session at the gym. Slow movements and a general sense of well-being.\n\n, Your expression will reflect those sexy thoughts you have in mind and intensify the sexual tension in the air. Look at your body, touch it, enjoy it and then look at your lover drawing his eyes to yours and to your body. Maintain eye contact at all times. If your back is turned to your partner, glance over your shoulder.\n\n, You\u2019re doing this for your pleasure too.\n\n\nA blindfold will help keep your lover's senses alert - itching to know what will come next.\nA pair of handcuffs or a silky scarf can be used to keep your lover\u2019s hands down if he breaks the no touching rule.\nUse a soft feather to brush up against your lover\u2019s body or yours. Sit on a chair and while holding your body upright and tall, slide your feet and legs apart and slowly brush yourself from your neck to the inside of your thigh.\nIf you\u2019re wearing a button up shirt, consider also wearing a tie. Loop it around his neck to pull him closer to your face or cleavage or tie his hands up with it if he breaks the no touching rule.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of girl that likes to be naughty, have your favorite toy at hand for your pleasure and his torture.\nTease him with a shawl or a silky wrap or use it to cover up if you feel more comfortable being a little less exposed.\nUse your hair. While standing up, kneeling, or sitting, stretch your torso while you pull your hair up and let it fall again. Use it to brush up against him.\nUse an ice cube from your cocktail. Place a cube in your mouth and run it along your lover's body or brush it across your nipples to set them firm.\nYour lips and your eyes are powerful seduction accessories. Try the classic pout or smile. Play with facial expressions.\nWith a bit of practice, a hat, scarf, cane or rider\u2019s crop can be used in sexually seductive ways.\n\n, Dim the lights, perfume the air and light some candles. Mix candlelight with floor lamps or fairy lights. candlelight adds a soft, warm glow to your body. Indirect lighting is both flattering and more intimate. Avoid fluorescent or white LED lights.\n\n\nSee that your room temperature is comfortable - feeling too cold or too hot will distract you.\nTurn off all possible distractions \u2013 TV and mobile phones etc.\n\n,\n\n\nCheck that the chair your lover will be sitting on can accommodate the both of you. Sit on it and imagine yourself in his position and then you on his lap.\n\n, The invitation will set his mind alight and prolong the torture across an entire day. Alternatively, spring it on him as a surprise. Either way, you\u2019ll need to spend a some time setting the scene and calming your nerves if it\u2019s your first time.\n\n, Have him sit with his legs closed. Start by staring him straight in the eye with a teasing smile on your face. Walk around your lover, touch him, drag your fingers through his hair and feel the beat. Strut about, pose, explain the rules to your lover and begin to slowly ease into your seductive performance.\n\n, Run your fingers through your hair, down your neck, your chest then down to your hips and around your butt. As you move your hands across your body imagine your hands are his hands. Enjoy the touch of your (his) hands on your body. Keeping your hands in contact with your body let them ride up your sides and back towards the nape of your neck. Look him in the eye and try a slow and gentle head roll (head falls forward and then rolls back up), letting your hair fall at the same time.\n\n, Move towards him so your crotch is almost against his knee then lean in like you're going to kiss him for just long enough that he can smell your perfume then pull away.\n\n, Think sexy and feel sexy. Begin moving your hips to the music in a soft circular motion. Close your eyes for a few seconds and enjoy the moment. There's no-one around, just you and your lover. Take your time, then, slowly step towards your partner, one foot in front of the other, cat-walk style. When you're near enough, take your lap dance to the next level.\n\n, Turn around and position yourself between your lover\u2019s legs. Bend down to sit on his lap and grind your bottom slowly (and gently) into his lap.\n\n, Top first...Seductively and gradually remove another item or two of clothing (perhaps your skirt or hot-pants) then move back towards your partner again. Get so close you'll practically be sitting on your lover's lap. Sensually lean in towards your lover's ear breathing your hot breath over it, let out a soft aching moan. Softly nibble or brush against his neck, breathing your lover in as if you were getting high off their scent.\n\n, Keep eye contact and keep caressing yourself from different angles and perspectives. Move into the crawl and then mount him again for another grinding session.\n\n, Move away for brief moments. Remember that eye contact is very important. Let your eyes transmit all those sexy thoughts and don\u2019t forget to smile.\n\n, Then move on to another part of the house or go for a walk. You may have to run...\n\n, The possibilities are endless and the results are always great.\n\n, He will love that!\n\n, Make sure to use condoms though!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":798}

The material you use for the ears should be stiff enough to keep it from flopping around loosely once attached to the headband and if you don\u2019t have felt, you can paint or color the cardboard black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack felt\nCardboard\nRigid construction paper (optional)\nHousehold glue\nPlain paper\nRibbon (10\u201d (25 cm) long)\nRibbon (3\u201d (7 cm) long)\nYou should be able to purchase everything you need for this project at your local fabric or craft store.;\n, The headband can be any color, but it should be at least \u00bd\" (1.27 cm) thick. You will eventually attach your mouse ears to the headband, so thicker headbands might give your mouse ears greater stability. Including a head band, you should also purchase the following tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadband\nHot glue gun (and glue)\nHousehold glue\nPencil\nPipe cleaner\nScissors\n\n, You should trace two circles on your paper with a pencil or your chalk. Each circle should be between 3\u201d and 5\u201d (7.6 and 12.7 cm) and have a \u00bd\u201d (1.27 cm) tab at the bottom of the circle. These templates will be used to assist you in outlining the dimensions of your mouse ears on both fabric and cardboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tabs will on the bottom of your circles will be used to secure the ears and the headband together.\nYou might be able to use the base of a bowl to help you in drawing identical circles for both of your templates.\n\n, Place your paper template on top of the felt and trace the circle with chalk onto it. You could use a piece of tailor\u2019s chalk, or even regular chalk in a pinch. This way, you can wipe any leftover chalk away with a damp cloth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake four felt circles for every pair of ears you make. You will need to glue felt to the front and back of your cardboard core to make your mouse ears uniformly black.\n\n, Take your scissors and follow the chalk outlines you've drawn to cut free your felt circles free from the fabric.You can add some jazzy flair to your mouse ears by using zig-zaggy pinking shears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinking shears will add a cute border to your fabric and prevent your fabric from becoming frayed., These cardboard circles will form the core of your mouse ears, making it possible for them stand up straight, just like Minnie's! Use your pencil or a piece of chalk to trace the circle template onto the cardboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need two cardboard circles for every pair of ears you make.\n\n, Using your scissors, follow the chalk or pencil outline you drew with your templates onto the cardboard. Be sure you don't cut off your tabs! These will be necessary to connect your mouse ears to the headband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to touch up your cardboard and felt circles\/tabs to make them as close to identical as possible.\nCompare and trim your felt and cardboard circles by holding the cardboard and felt pieces together in a stack. Then you can trim down any irregularities.\n\n, Household glue should be sufficient to attach a piece of felt to the front and back of each cardboard circle\/ear. Drizzle glue back and forth along the cardboard and press your felt into place. Press the felt to the glue firmly for five to ten minutes help it set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create the best bond between your glue and the felt, you may want to allow your glue to rest for 30 minutes to an hour., Regular household glue won\u2019t hold up to wear and tear as well as hot glue. The special glue used in hot glue guns, however, is much more durable. It will create a firm bond between ear and headband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll have to move quick after you apply your hot glue. The glue will dry quickly soon after application.\nHot glue fresh from the gun will be very hot. Be careful not to burn yourself., Your circles should be at least 4\u201d (10 cm) apart so that you have room for the bow that will go between the ears. You may want to mark your headband with your chalk where you'll be attaching the ears to prevent yourself from gluing them into the wrong place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your headband is flexible or will permit the use of staples, you could also use a hardy stapler to connect the tabs of your mouse ears to your headband.\n\n, Playing with your mouse ears before the glue has completely dried could cause your mouse ears to come free of the headband. To ensure you don't have to re-glue any of your pieces together, you should allow your glue to firm for 30 minutes to an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Your mouse ears might not stand straight up like Minnie Mouse's at first. To encourage your mouse ears to hold this position, fold both up and forward. The glued tabs will keep the ears in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You can use either ribbon or fabric for your bow, although ribbon will likely be a little shinier and look more like the bow Minnie wears. In either case, it should be 5\u201d to 8\u201d (12.7 to 20.3 cm) wide. You will eventually gather this fabric around its middle, which will cause the sides to fan out. This will give your bow its shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThicker cuts of fabric will create more bunching when you gather this piece around its middle, which will give your bow a fuller appearance., This is the piece you will use to gather the fabric around the middle of your 10\" (25 cm) length of ribbon. You should use a similar kind of fabric to your 10\" (25 cm) ribbon, but you could also add some pop to your design by using a contrasting color fabric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you are using Minnie's traditional bow color, red with white polka-dots, you might choose a bold blue for your gathering string.\n\n, Put the print side face down. You're going to want to glue your gathering string along the back of your bow, which will be the same as the opposite side of the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You'll want each side to overlap slightly at the center of your 10\" (25 cm) length of ribbon. Fold one end at a time so that there is enough overlap to glue these side where the meet at the center of the ribbon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, It should only take a dab or two of hot glue or fabric glue to join the ends together firmly. Press the fabric firmly to create a stronger bond between the fabric and glue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should follow the directions on your glue to achieve the best bond. Some glues will set and cure faster than others. Generally, you should hold the glue firmly for one to five minutes for best results., Use one hand to pinch your ribbon together toward its centermost point from the top and bottom edges. This will be easiest to do if you are working with a ribbon that is at least 5\u201d (12.7 cm) wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinching your ribbon together tightly will cause the outside edges to flare out more dramatically.\n\n, The 3\u201d (7.6 cm) piece of ribbon will hold the fabric of your bow in its flared position. Wind it around several times and then remove your fingers where you were pinching the bow in the middle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold the ribbon with your free hand to make sure it doesn't come unwound or loose.\nWind the remaining length of your ribbon around the center tightly.\n\n, Lift one end of the small piece of ribbon and apply a dab of hot glue or fabric glue. If using hot glue, you should be careful not to burn yourself by pressing on the fabric immediately after glue application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo apply pressure to make the best seal between your hot glue and fabric, you might use a tool to prevent getting burned, like a paperweight, gloved hand, or tweezers.\nFabric glue and other cold glues should be held together firmly to encourage a strong bond. Press the glued piece of ribbon together. Hold this position for about 30 seconds to a minute.\n\n, The bunchings of your bow fabric should have created folds through which you can thread your pipe cleaner so that it passes under your glued gathering string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you find it difficult to feed your pipe cleaner through a fold and under your gathering string, you can always use glue to attach the pipe cleaner along the back of your bow.\nA dab of hot glue onto the back of your gathering string should be enough to hold your pipe cleaner in place.\n\n, Orient your pipe cleaner so it is equal length on both sides of your gathering string. Now cross the sides of your pipe cleaner at the midpoint over the front of your gathering string and add a twist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping out of the bow while adding stability to the bow in general.\nExperiment with different colored pipe cleaners to personalize your Minnie Mouse ears!\n\n, Center the bow between the ears. Then you're going to wrap each end of the pipe cleaner around opposite ends of your headband. Twine each side of the pipe cleaner down opposite ends of the headband until you go no further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ends of pipe cleaner can be pointy. To prevent the wearer from getting poked, you may want to turn these inward on your headband. The ends can also be taped to the headband as an extra precaution.\nBy attaching your bow to your mouse ears with a pipe cleaner, you'll be able to swap out different bows without having to make a new pair of mouse ears.\nTwist ties can be used to reinforce your pipe cleaners if you find the pipe cleaner windings are not holding the bow in place well enough.\n\n, Minnie, being a stylish mouse, would probably go ga-ga over some rhinestones, glitter, feathers, or other accents you might add to your mouse ears. Most of these can be attached with a small dab of hot glue. Once you've finished adding your finishing touches, you should show off your mouse ears to all your friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":799}
{"text":";\n, These funny numbers are T & S parameters named after some Aussie engineers. Sensitivity of a speaker is a measure of efficiency. Try and find one that is rated at more than 90 dB\/watt at one metre and can take about 100 watts RMS of power. Parts express, Jaycar, and eBay are all good for various sub parts. Car subwoofer speakers WILL WORK FINE, as long as the overall ohm impedance is not lower than the receiver's.\n\n, Try a few speakers until you find one that is suitable. Good ones are vented for efficiency and offer low low bass. This project has no vent ] but is still a solid performer. However, by cutting a round hole in it of the right diameter with the right length tube it would really take off down low.\n\n, This may involve consulting your life partner. 130 liters (34.3\u00a0US\u00a0gal) is pretty serious for a 12 or 15 inch speaker 100 liter (26.4\u00a0US\u00a0gal) for a 10 inch. To calculate the volume you will be using the inside dimensions in cm (that way you will get the volume in milliliters) minus any bracing, amplifier, the back of the speaker and vents. Errors of 5% should not matter much.\n\n, You will then be able to adjust the box's \"tuning frequency\" - don't worry about what this value is too much; just look at the graph and see if the vent is a reasonable length and diameter (see warnings).\n\n, If it is still above -3dB at 35 Hz, you have some decent bass. The tuning frequency should end up somewhere between 20 Hz (wow you have got a decent speaker) and 40 Hz. All other things being equal, go lower. Below the tuning frequency speakers are relatively unhappy, so it pays to go low.\n\n, (there is no need for any fanciness, just butt the pieces up against each other) Then get your hardware store to cut it. They will be straighter and squarer and more accurate than you (probably) which will make it easy to assemble.\n\n, Screws at least twice as long as your MDF is thick are best. You will need to drill clearance holes to allow the screw to pass through plus smaller holes in the other pieces to allow the thread to go in. Go crazy and glue and screw some bits of wood onto the walls of the box to make it stiff. The box should vibrate as little as possible (the vibrating speaker makes the sound not the box - concrete anyone?) and be leak proof. Don't forget these brace bits (cleats) will change your box volume!\n\n, 'Plate' amplifiers designed to mount in boxes are easy. Just remember to make sure that it does not touch the walls of its hole anywhere to avoid damage. Also remember it is a mains voltage device. If you spend 1.5 times on the amplifier what you did (or should have) on the speaker you will be OK. Matching the speaker to the amp watt for watt is good too. With an efficient speaker 200 watts is very very loud.\n\n, Are all your corners sealed?\n\n, Use glue. Do not stuff the box solid, this technique is for sealed, not vented boxes.\n\n,, If you don't have one, most plate amps will create their own subwoofer channel and return the rest to your amplifier or direct to your speakers (see its manual).\n\n, If it is a bit quiet and the auto on function does not work right (most plate amps will turn on when there is a signal) and if the plate amp has a stereo input then buy a cable that splits the single channel .1 into two identical wires and connect them to the stereo plate amp inputs.\n\n, Or put it in the front corner and try the phase switch in both directions (don't panic if you can't tell any difference).\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":800}
{"text":" There are many instruments to choose from the most common ones being the guitar and the drums. Learning bass can prove fruitful as well. If you are planning to start an alternative rock band you can even consider piano or the turntables.;\n, Really, unless you're planning to be a solo artist put together a band. Get people who can actually sing or play an instrument well too, Even if you're planning on going solo you still need someone to play the other instruments or sing backup.\n\n, Keep believing in yourself. If you lose hope in your talents, you'll never make it anywhere. Sometimes you think you lost your talent, but you should just take a rest and come back later to try again.Dream what you want to be. Imagine yourself playing one of your songs at rock am ring in front of your fans.\n\n, Writing constantly is the key. Practice makes perfect.\n\n, It's a good idea to make a CD with your tracks.\n\n,, Watch their expressions. If there's a lot of concerned faces and shaking of heads, tweak a little more of your tunes.\n\n, Sometimes they're hard to get but you need for the live entertainment experience. This is the most crucial part. The idea is to get as many gigs as possible. Visiting or phoning hundreds of pubs for two weeks straight to get as many gigs packed in as possible is very important. Also playing day after day in front of a large audience will have your performing talents skyrocket.\n\n, Now it begins.\n\n,,, Make sure the video is \"cool\" and will appeal to many people.\n\n,, Because then you would be a quitter, and rock stars aren't quitters as quitters don't rock.\n\n, Don't ever lose sight of the initial reason that led you to become a rock star in the first place.\n\n, Every genre has different ways. Rock is 1 genre but rock stars tend to stretch it out a little bit by putting their feelings, different notes, different patterns,etc. Copying other rock stars is uncool .Don't worry if your music sounds different than any normal kind of song.

Otherwise when you're looking for something, you might not find it because the thing you're looking in is too messy.\n, in an organized fashion in your binder or backpack.\n, Write down when handouts are due, permission slips, homework, papers, projects, and everything else. Don't just think, \"I'll totally remember this!\" or, \"I'll get the homework assignment from a friend\" most likely you won't. Just stay organized and it will improve your grades because in most schools part of your grade is whether or not you hand in homework\/projects are on time.\n, Write those days down in your homework planner so you can plan out when the week before is, and plan time to study.\n, Well written notes taken from class can be a great study buddy! Try to study your notes a little bit every night, it can be a life saver when it comes to pop quizzes! Studying will obviously improve your grades because studying will lead to good grades on assessments and all assessment grades whether it's a test, quiz, or pop quiz.\n,\n\n\nStart with making a simple list or plan. Write all of your ideas and all of the others ideas. Often, when the plan is done, it tends to be a little too much of all your ideas. When you work together to find the best ideas, let loose of the ones that aren't as impacting or important. Don't try to be sneaky and have the outcome end up being all of your ideas. The other people will notice and get annoyed and might even say something. Make sure the outcome consists your ideas and the other peoples ideas.\n\n\nPlan times when everyone involved is free and you can get together and work on the project. Don't get mad at them because of an accidental mistake. Academics always come first if you want to get good grades. Try to get as much done as possible at your meetings so the project\/paper will be done fast. Usually people get into fights about what to contribute to the assignment. This shouldn't happen in your case, because of the plan.\n\n\nMake sure you listen to what other people have to say. This will help your overall report card grade because you would have worked well together and gotten the project\/paper done on time.\n\n\nWhen you get everyone to make the plan, make sure everyone else knows and agrees that the outcome is the final decision and there is no switching around. This will really avoid fights.\n\n\n, If they complain that you're being too bossy, apologize and try to be less bossy.\n, Now you should have great grades which lead to happy parents.\n, Nobody is going to like you or appreciate you for the true gem you can be unless you're nice, kind, sweet, and caring!\n, Don't copy other peoples ideas, make your own personal creative ones that really show your personality. If you have to; ask people before you use their ideas.\n, Don't compliment the same people day after day. It might get really annoying for that person; not to mention, the other people will start getting jealous.\n,, Everyone is at least worth a chance to be your friend! When you do this you'll eventually figure who know who is a backstabber, who is nice, who is a good friend, and who is smart.\n, They will realize you guided them in to the right place and can be really thankful and really want to be your friend! Plus, they'll always think of you as \"the true friend that has been nice to me from the start\".\n, This step may even give you a good friend from just a simple act of kindness.\n,\n\nIf you know who the popular people are, talk with them.\nDon't be afraid to make friends of the opposite gender.\nDon't be afraid to get involved with those people outside of school.\nBe nice to the younger kids.\nRespect the older kids.\n\n, Dating and perhaps kissing is fine.

You can wax your arms, but no shaving your arms.\n, Any brand is fine, as long as it is good quality and works.\n, While the conditioner is in your hair, comb out the knots in your hair with a nice wide tooth comb. This way once your hair dries, it will feel nice and smooth.\n,, Dead skin is gross and unattractive.\n,,, It's unattractive and will make your shirt look like an Appaloosa with all of it's wet spots.\n\n, Nobody will like being around you if your breath stinks and you have tons of food globs in between your teeth!\n\n,, The key is to not overdo it. Nothing looks worse than too much makeup. Also, do what works best for you and what you feel most comfortable in. For most middle school girls, a cute simple look would be mascara, eyeliner, blush, & pink or clear lipgloss. The mascara color depends on your eyelash color.\n\n, If they're brown or any other color, use brown.\n\n, Black can look totally natural on some people, but really fake on others. Test out both and decide which is most natural. A thin line on the bottom lid, top lid, or maybe both is all that is needed to avoid the \"raccoon\" look.\n\n, If you have more faded colored lips, then pink lip gloss is better, or even a little lip stain before the lip gloss for even more color.\n\n, (This depends whether your skin is light or dark. Use powder for light skin, bronzer for more tanned or dark skin.)\n\n,, Experiment with the way you look and see what fits you!\n\n,, There are some people who only wear jeans and Uggs\/Converse\/All Stars, everyday, but they won't really look sophisticated. Yes, I suppose it is \"trendy\" but it's also a really boring look!\n\n, This is important, because if you buy one that's too loose, it'll gape when you're bending over, and if you buy one too tight, it will be very uncomfortable.\n\n, This isn't necessarily important unless you like to wear form-fitting pants or skirts.\n\n,,,\n\n\n\nIf you get Fuggs try them on and compare them to real Ugg boots. They need to be good quality knock-offs because how embarrassing would it be if your Fuggs just fell apart when you're out. People will remember you as the cheap girl who wears cheap Fuggs if that happens!\n\n, If you can get more than one pair, high-tops, low-tops, and different colors are all great! Only buy real Converse or All Stars, if you can't afford them (they are only like $20-$40, it depends where you find them) then don't buy them. Do not get the fake converse sold at Payless\/Justice et cetera. They are terrible quality.\n\n,,, If you have curls, let 'em show girl! Hot waves? Hit the beach babe! Straight haired Hun? Throw it out of that bun!\n\n, You're natural color is usually what looks best on you.\n\n, A good trim every month or so for healthy ends works.

{"text":" As with any illness, the more time you can give your body to rest, the faster you will likely recover from the infection. Most acute coughs are caused by the common cold or the flu, and taking time to rest can enhance your immune function and your ability to fight off the bug.\n\n\nIf you cannot get time off work, see if you can cancel other commitments to give your body more rest.\nGet extra sleep if this is at all possible in your schedule. Sleep is one of the best ways to boost your immune function.;\n, Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day.\n\n\nIt can also be helpful to use a humidifier \u2014 which vaporizes water into the air \u2014 to ease symptoms of your cough.\nThe steam from a hot shower can also help to clear your airways and to improve your cough., Note that using OTC cough medications is only useful if your cough is caused from an acute respiratory infection, such as the common cold or the flu.\n\n\nOver the counter cold and cough remedies are generally not recommended for children under six years old, and their effectiveness in this age group has not proven to be effective.\n\n, Lozenges can be purchased at most grocery stores, or at your local drugstore or pharmacy.\n\n, The first thing to do if you have an acute cough is to determine whether you need to go into the Emergency Room, or whether it is okay to wait to see your family doctor. Indications to go straight to the Emergency Room include:\n\n\nShortness of breath compromising your ability to breathe\nA fever indicating a possible infection\nOther underlying health issues that leave you immunocompromised (such as having HIV\/AIDS or an organ transplant)\n\n, She may offer you:\n\n\nSupplemental oxygen\nA bronchodilator, which is a medication that will relax the bronchi and bronchioles in your lungs\nPositive airway pressure, such as a CPAP or BiPAP machine\nIn rare cases, ventilatory support\n\n, He will ask you questions like:\n\n\nWhen did your cough begin?\nHave you had a cough like this before?\nIs your cough getting better or worse?\nDoes it come in episodes, or is the cough constant?\n\n, Things she may ask about are:\n\n\nIs it a productive cough?\nIs there blood in your cough?\nIs there a wheezy aspect to your cough?\n\n, Things to tell your doctor about include:\n\n\nChest pain \u2014 and whether this radiates anywhere else in your body\nShortness of breath\nGeneral fatigue\nLightheadedness, dizziness, and\/or fainting\nA fever\n\n, Let your doctor know if you have a history of:\n\n\nDiabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or ongoing heart disease\nOngoing respiratory disease prior to the onset of your cough\nAcid reflux (GERD) or symptoms of heartburn, indigestion or frequent sour tastes in your mouth\nAllergic rhinitis (hay fever), which can cause a cough due to post-nasal drip\nA condition that compromises your immune system (such as HIV\/AIDS or an organ transplant)\n\n, The stethoscope can detect crackles in your lungs when there is fluid buildup (such as in cases of pulmonary oedema or pneumonia). Your doctor will also look for other signs on physical exam, including:\n\n\nAn elevated \"JVP\" (jugular venous pressure, which assesses the amount of blood in your neck veins) \u2014 this can indicate whether there is fluid buildup such as in congestive heart failure and\/or pulmonary oedema.\nSigns of hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) by assessing the circulation in your hands, and around your tongue and the inside of your cheeks (these areas show it more quickly if you are deprived of oxygen).\nOther abnormal breath sounds, such as wheezing or stridor (a harsh, vibrating sound) or decreased air movement.\n\n, A chest x-ray may show signs of an enlarged heart, such as in congestive heart failure. It may also show fluid buildup in the lungs. It will show pneumonia if you have it, and it can also detect lung cancer.\n\n\nIf the x-ray alone is inconclusive, your doctor may request that you proceed with a CT scan to look at your lungs in more detail.\nHowever, in many cases, the x-ray alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis and to begin a treatment plan.\n\n, Some causes of an acute cough (such as heart-related causes, or a pulmonary embolism \u2014 a blood clot in the lung) can be ruled in or ruled out via an ECG. This is a quick and easy test to obtain so, if your doctor suspects a heart-related cause or a pulmonary embolism as the reason for your acute cough, you will likely receive this investigation.\n\n, Your doctor may decide to do a computed tomographic (CT) scan of your chest, which can provide your doctor with more detailed images of your lungs than an x-ray. This can be used to rule out serious afflictions.\n\nA PE (pulmonary embolism, which is a blood clot in the lung that can lead to an acute cough) can be ruled out with a CT scan.\n\n, This can reveal if there is an infection present, and also what type of microbe is growing there so that the antibiotic treatment can be specifically targeted to the bacteria that has infected you (if it is indeed bacterial).\n\n, Spirometry is a type of lung function test. It can be used to diagnose asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among other things. A COPD \"exacerbation\" is a common cause of an acutely worsened cough, so this is something that your doctor may wish to consider in the diagnostic process.\n\n\nChronic bronchitis and emphysema are types of COPD.\n\n, In more severe cases, you may need positive airway pressure (such as a CPAP machine or a BiPAP machine) or, rarely, ventilator support.\n\n\nBronchodilators such as albuterol are also used in the event of bronchospasm.\nIt is key to ensure that you are getting adequate oxygen delivery before proceeding with further treatment.\n\n, This is not true in all cases (it depends upon the risk level of your infection, and whether it is believed to be bacterial). Your doctor can guide you as to whether antibiotic treatment is needed in your case.\n\n\nNote that, in a viral infection (or an infection caused by any microorganism other than bacteria), antibiotics will be of no benefit.\n\n, An example of an IV blood thinner is Heparin. An example of an oral blood thinner is Warfarin (Coumadin). The purpose of blood thinning medications is to prevent any further formation of blood clots (or growth of the current blood clot), and to allow your body's natural mechanisms to dissolve the clot that is currently there.\n\n\nNote, however, that if your pulmonary embolism is severe \u2014 leading to a severe cough and debilitating shortness of breath \u2014 you may need \"clot busting\" drugs to break the clot apart, or a surgical intervention to remove the clot.\n\n, You may need:\n\n\nDiuretics\nVenodilators\nBlood pressure medications\nMedications to reduce your cardiovascular risk factors\nTreatment of the underlying cause of your heart failure\n\n, You may also need to begin oral steroids (such as Prednisone) for a short period of time, to get your cough and shortness of breath under control.\n\n\nSystemic and inhaled steroids are also used in acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis.\nIf the cause of your COPD exacerbation is a respiratory tract infection, you may also need antibiotics.\n\n, A more rare cause is:\n\n\nCardiac tamponade, which is when blood pools around your heart leading to compression of the heart, fluid build-up in the lungs, and a resulting wet and productive cough accompanied by chest pain and shortness of breath.\nThe treatment for a cardiac tamponade is \"pericardiocentesis\" (a needle inserted into your chest cavity to remove the blood that has pooled around your heart).\nIn the event that the cough is due to acid reflux, H2 blockers or PPI's may be helpful to relieve symptoms, and also lifestyle changes (avoiding spicy and acidic foods, elevating head of bed for sleep).\nIf the cough is due to allergic rhinitis, nasal corticosteroids may prove helpful as well as oral antihistamines.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":804}
{"text":" They can be whatever you want. Just make sure you will be comfortable. I recommend a sleep T-shirt or tank top, sleep shorts, slippers, and a robe if you have one.;\n, If you would like, lay them out on your bed and just take your robe or slippers in the bathroom, and after you shower, you could get dressed in your room. Whatever you want.\n\n, Start by brushing your hair out thoroughly. Doing this will give the blood vessels in your head a stimulation, causing more blood flow to the head. Brushing your hair before showering will also let shampoo and conditioner clean your hair more thoroughly.\n\n, Get into the shower and thoroughly wet your entire body, leaving not an inch of yourself dry.\n\n, Focus mostly on your scalp and the tips of you hair.\n\n, Leave the Conditioner in for 3-5 Minutes.\n\n, Wash yourself Thoroughly. Don't forget to scrub your feet, underarms, behind your ears, neck, and your private parts.\n\n, Get a bit of soap or shaving cream, and rub it on your legs. Slowly and softly bring the razor up your legs, being careful not to cut yourself. If you tend to shake and accidentally cut yourself while shaving, inhale and then when you slowly exhale, slowly pull the razor up your leg. The exhale will calm you, leaving you less shaky. Do the same with your underarms if necessary.\n\n, This will close your pores up after taking a hot shower.\n\n, You can also do this for your hair if you want. Get a face towel and blot your face to dry it. Do not rub! It will irritate your face and cause skin peeling and redness.\n\n, Use an exfoliating scrubby with a reputable face wash. Good brands to use are Neutrogena and Aveeno.\n\n, Blow drying it will cause heat damage. Nothing about split ends and dry, lifeless hair is pretty.\n\n,, This will make your nails look healthy and shiny without even trying. You could also paint your nails, if you'd like. Nail art is optional.\n\n, Clip your toenails and add fresh coats of paint.\n\n, Now you probably feel fresh and beautiful!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":805}
{"text":" You\u2019ll need measuring tape, a pencil, and a book or a ruler (or some other flat surface)., Their head should be facing straight ahead, and not tilted upwards or downwards, so you do not get a faulty measurement of their height.\n\n\nMake sure their feet are side by side, with both feet firmly on the floor and their heels touching the wall.Allow your child to keep their shoes on, as they will be wearing them when they ride the bike.\n\n, Place the ruler, book or other flat surface on your child\u2019s head. The ruler should be positioned against the wall, parallel with the floor. Mark where the ruler touches the wall with a pencil., Once you have marked the point on the wall, have your child move aside so you can measure their height. Extend the measuring tape from the point you have marked to the floor and write down the measurement. This dimension is the height of your toddler.Keep in mind that kid\u2019s bikes are measured by the size of the wheels, not the frame height. Bikes for toddlers usually range from 12 and 16 inches.\nIn general, 12-inch wheels are designed for children 36-40 inches tall, 16-inch wheels are for children 41-49 inches tall, and 20-inch wheels are for children 50-56 inches tall., Measuring their inseam is important because you need to be sure your child can place their entire foot on the ground while on the bike. If the bike is too big and your child cannot put their feet down, it will be hard for them to balance and they may get frustrated while trying to learn how to ride.\n\n\nYou can easily determine your child\u2019s inseam measurement if they try the bike before you purchase it. But if you are buying a bike without your toddler, you will need to measure their inseam.\n\n, Write down the measurement on a piece of paper and take it with you when you go bike shopping for your toddler.\n\n, Place the string on the floor, between the child's feet, and stretch it to the child's crotch. Then, put your finger on the place on the string to indicate the height of their crotch. Move the string and cut with it with scissors at the place where your finger is. Measure the length of tape using a ruler.\n\n\nKeep in mind that toddlers with an inseam up to 18 inches and a height up to 40 inches need a bicycle with 12-inch wheels. Toddlers who have an inseam up to 18 inches and are taller than 40 inches need 16-inch wheels., The diameter of the bike\u2019s wheels should be clearly labelled on the bike\u2019s packaging or the box. Ask the sales associate at the store if you are not sure where to find the diameter of the bike\u2019s wheels.\n\n\nIf you are purchasing a used bike, use a yardstick or measuring tape to measure the diameter of the tire. Start on the outside of the tire and pull the measuring tape straight across until you get to the other side of the tire--the number on your measuring tape with be the tire\u2019s diameter.\nUse your child's height and inseam measurements to find the right diameter size for the wheels. You can also access a size chart onlineto determine the right wheel diameter for your child, based on their age.\n\n, If you have a two or three year-old who is tall, it is better to provide him with a smaller bike that has 12-inch wheels because they will sit lower in the seat. It will also make it easier to for them to reach the bike\u2019s handlebars.\n\n\nIf your child is older, but short for their age, choose a bicycle with 16-inch wheels. Older children have longer legs and arms, so a smaller bike will be awkward for them to use., Loosen the screw under the bike seat, located where the seat goes into the frame. When you loosen it, you will then be able to move the seat up on or down to suit your child.\n\n, To ride the bike easily and comfortably, your child\u2019s knee will be slightly bent when the pedal is in the down position, as this allows a stronger stroke on the pedal than when their leg is stretched out.\n\n\nWhen the pedals are in the up position, your child\u2019s thighs should be horizontal and not stick out.\n\n, Correct handlebar placement is especially important when your child is first learning how to balance and steer a bike.\n\n\nYour child should be able to sit upright and be close to the handlebars but their knees should not hit the handlebars when they pedal.Your child should also be able to comfortably place both hands on the grip pads and have enough movement to turn easily., Press them with your little finger, as children do not have the same pressure in their fingers as adults. If you can press the brake levers with your little finger without much effort, your toddler will be able to press them too., Most childrens\u2019 bikes come with adjustable handlebars and seats because children grow quickly, so it shouldn\u2019t be hard to find an adjustable bike.\n\n\nSome bikes come with quick-release adjustments, so adjustments can be made without needing any tools, but this also makes it easier for bike parts to be removed and stolen.\nOther bikes come with a traditional adjustment system, which can require basic tools or special parts that are often included with the bike.\nCheck to see what type of adjustment system is on your child\u2019s bike and look for one that matches your adjustment preferences.\n\n, Always bring your child with you to test a used bike before purchasing it, and make sure the brakes work and that all the other pieces are in order.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask the seller questions about how old the bike is and if it has been in any major crashes. Used bikes are best if they are on their newer side (only a few years old) and haven\u2019t been in any major crashes.\nIf the bike doesn\u2019t fit or isn\u2019t in a safe condition, walk away and look for a better option. Used bikes are sometimes stolen merchandise being resold. If you are suspicious that the used bike might be stolen, look for the serial number, which is usually located underneath the main support post. Contact the police department or search the internet with the serial number and description of the bike to see if any stolen bike reports matching the number appear.\n\n, Employees at specialty stores tend to receive better training so they can recommend the correct bike size and features for your child.\n\n, When sitting on the seat with their hands on the handlebars, a child should be able to place the balls of both feet on the ground at the same time.Your child should be able to straddle the tallest bar on the bike while still having their feet flat on the ground on both sides of the bike, which helps them quickly stop the bike or get off if they start to fall.If your child can\u2019t fulfill these requirements, try a smaller size bike or adjust the seat so it is on a lower setting.\n\n, This bike style is a popular option and comes in very small sizes. This bike looks like a typical toddler bike, but does not have pedals, so your toddler can straddle the bike and walk with it. Balance bikes are a good starting point for young children because they give them the feel of a bike and will teach them to steer and control the bike without having to use pedals.\n\n\nThey can be used by children as young as 18 months old.\n\n, Once they are ready for a real bike, you can add training wheels to this style.\n\n\nTraining wheels should be attached next to the rear wheel and should start flush with the ground. As your child gets more comfortable balancing on the bike, you can raise the training wheels, which will force them to balance on their own.Often, toddlers that start with balance bikes can skip the training wheel phase or go through it quickly.Keep an eye on your child to monitor their progress and comfort levels.\n\n, This way, your child can pedal backwards to brake. Young children don\u2019t have the hand strength or coordination to use hand brakes.In fact, children younger than six should only use coaster brakes.\n\n\nMost bikes come with hand brakes when they are have 16 inch wheels and bigger, which the average child will fit into when they are 6-7 years old.Make sure the brakes can be activated quickly and have the power to stop the bike. Have your child test the brakes, and then test them yourself with a hand or foot to see how quickly they react.\n\n, These styles aren\u2019t ideal for children until they have a firm grasp on riding a bike.\n\n\nOnce your child becomes a more confident rider, you can experiment with bikes for different types of terrain.\nAll children should learn to ride a bike on a flat, even surface, like cement. If your child will be riding on dirt roads or cobblestone paths, look for a bike with larger shocks for a more comfortable ride.\nFor best results and personal recommendations, consult a biking professional at a sporting goods or biking store.\n\n, In general, the less expensive bikes will be heavier because they are made of steel instead of the more expensive alloy metals.Steel bikes are still safe, but can be slightly more difficult to maneuver and are heavier if your child crashes and gets trapped under their bike.\n\n, Helmets are required by law in most states when riding in public places, and they are always a good idea for young children learning to ride a bike. Helmets also reduce the risk of bicycle-related head injury by 88%.A helmet is only effective if it fits your child\u2019s head properly. The right helmet will rest just above your child\u2019s eyebrows and sit level around their entire head. It shouldn\u2019t move around on their head when shaken, and the strap should be snug but still allow your child room to move their mouth and talk.\nHelmets that are designed specifically for biking are best, but your child can also wear a helmet designed for another activity, like rollerblading or skateboarding, as long as it fits them properly.\n\n, Though these are not required, it may be beneficial to protect your child from the typical falls and stumbles that may happen when they first learn how to ride.\n\n\nMost pad sets are sold according to the height, age, and weight of a child. Use the same measurements you took for correct bike sizing to choose the correct pad size.\nHave your child try the pads on to ensure they are comfortable. You also ask a store employee to help you with sizing and material recommendations for safety gear.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":806}
{"text":" This will reduce the stress on your pelvic floor muscles, and may help to improve (or at least to prevent worsening of) your vaginal prolapse.\n\n\nKeep in mind that surgery is not necessary with vaginal prolapse. You can leave the prolapse untreated without any negative impact on your health.;\n, The pessary will hold your vaginal structures in place, thus preventing symptoms of prolapse and\/or worsening of your prolapse. You will need to see your doctor to discuss this treatment option and to have it inserted into your vagina.\n\n\nA vaginal pessary must be removed and cleaned at regular intervals.\nYour physician can instruct you on how to do this, as well as the frequency at which it needs to be done.\nSome women find vaginal pessaries uncomfortable, or find that they fall out and have difficulty keeping them in place.\nTry a pessary and to see how you feel with it in. You can evaluate from there whether you find it a helpful mode of treatment.\nVaginal pessaries are more successful in women who are not sexually active than in women who are. If you are sexually active, you or your partner can remove the pessary for intercourse., Do Kegel exercises at least 3 times per day, ultimately aiming for 10 repetitions each time. Here's how to effectively perform Kegel exercises:\n\n\nTo identify your pelvic muscles (the ones you will be flexing during Kegel exercises), stop urinating mid-stream. Notice which muscles you used to do this task - this feeling of muscle tightening is what you will be aiming for when you perform the exercises (which is recommended to do when you are not urinating - the urination test is simply used to allow you to identify the muscles).\nWhen lying down or sitting comfortably, contract your pelvic muscles and hold the contraction for 5 seconds. Then, release for 5 seconds, and then repeat this 5 times. Ultimately, you will want to aim to hold the contraction for 10 seconds, to release for 10 seconds, and to repeat this 10 times.\nStay relaxed as you perform the exercise and do not hold your breath. Rather, continue to breathe deeply as you perform the exercises.\nKegel exercises are not meant to be tiring; they are more about focus, as you keep your mind focused on the contractions that will effectively strengthen these muscles.\nIf you have difficulty performing Kegels, then let your doctor know. You may need a referral to see a physical therapist for help.\n\n, They are linked to the decreased estrogen that is present post-menopause, as a decreased estrogen level correlates to a weakening of the vaginal area and the surrounding muscles and ligaments.\n\n\nThe most common way to deliver the estrogen is to insert an estrogen cream into your vagina, but any form of estrogen will work. However, keep in mind that homeopathic remedies cannot replace this therapy.\nEstrogen replacement therapy can help to prevent this natural weakening of the pelvic muscles and ligaments, and hence to reduce the risk of any further vaginal prolapse.\nNote that there are some cases in which estrogen replacement therapy is not safe. These include people with certain types of cancers whose growth may be fuelled by the presence of estrogen (such as many breast cancers), as well as those who are at an increased risk of blood clots and stroke, among other things.\nYour doctor will be able to go over the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy in your specific case, to help you decide whether this treatment is right for you.\n\n, The type and extent of the surgery will vary depending upon the type and severity of your prolapse.\n\n\nThis is something that your surgeon will assess and discuss with you after he or she has performed a physical exam to thoroughly assess the extent of your vaginal prolapse.\nAs you await surgery, you may be offered treatments such as a vaginal pessary to help control your prolapse until it can be corrected surgically.\nAlso, keep in mind that there is no medical reason why surgery has to be done.\n\n, Tell your doctor if you have had problems with general anesthesia in the past, or if you have a family history of problems tolerating anesthetic. Most people are completely fine with it; however, it is important to talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have.\n\n\nSome women just receive a spinal or an epidural for pain control during surgery.\nWhile general anesthesia is normally recommended, these are other options that can be considered.\n\n, In vaginal surgery, the surgery is conducted through the vaginal opening. In laparoscopic surgery, small instruments are inserted into the abdominal cavity though tiny incision points, with the help of a small camera that allows the surgeon to see during the operation.\n\n\nUnless there are complications, you will most likely need to stay in the hospital for one to two days following surgery. This will help to ensure that the initial stages of your recovery are going well.\nRecurrence after having prolapse surgery can be as high as 20 to 60%. To reduce your risk, be diligent about doing Kegels, limiting lifting, and any other preventative measure that your doctor suggests after surgery.\n\n, Ask your boss for modified duties at the workplace if you have a job that involves heavy physical labor.\n\n\nYour doctor may advise that you do Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles in your pelvic area following surgery.\nBe sure to follow your doctor's advice on when to begin strengthening exercises, and how many to do at a time, so that you do not put undue stress on your pelvic area following surgery.\nAlso avoid sexual intercourse for 6 weeks following surgery, to allow time for a full recovery., Being overweight can significantly increase your risk of recurrence of the condition following surgery, due to the continual extra pressure in the area. Therefore, to minimize your risk as much as possible, and to ensure that the benefits of surgery last for as long as possible, you may want to consider weight loss.\n\n\nStrategies to reduce your weight (if you are overweight) include increasing your aerobic (fat-burning) exercise, and improving the health of your diet, among others.\n\nClick here for more information on how to lose weight safely and effectively if this is of interest to you.\nYou will also want to ask your doctor to treat chronic conditions such as a persistent cough or ongoing constipation, which may put additional stress on your abdominal and pelvic floor muscles.\n\n, You can return to normal activity fully by six to nine weeks after surgery, and your surgeon can advise you on a plan for a gradual return to activity during this time period.\n\n\nNote that sexual problems may persist even after the surgery is complete.\nThe surgery will most likely resolve the anatomic problem (the prolapse), but it will not necessarily resolve associated sexual challenges.\nIf you are struggling to get your sex life back on track, you can ask your doctor for suggestions or for a referral to a physician who specializes in women's sexual health and wellbeing.\nChallenges that are common include pain with intercourse and decreased libido, among other things.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":807}

{"text":" The placement test helps you decide whether or not an algebra class is right for you. Maybe you don't need algebra, or maybe you need to take a different math class to prepare you for algebra. Usually, a placement test is free and comes with an appointment with the academic counselor; they will be able to tell you about your specific situation.;\n, When registering for a college course, you can choose your own professor. Ask around and find out about the different professors. Choose a section taught by a quality professor that you think would fit with your learning style.\n\n\nChoose a section that also fits with your schedule allowing you to attend every class.\nUse websites that have reviews from students have taken the course with that professor to find out who would be a good fit for you.\n\n, Many community colleges have testing centers that allow you to schedule your exams to be taken outside of the classroom. This can allow for flexibility in case you need a few more days of study. You also may be given more time to finish the exam than you would during a normally scheduled class period.\n\n\nSpeak with your professor at the beginning of the course about scheduling exams outside the classroom.\n\n, If this course is essential to you continuing on to the next course, make it the highest priority when you\u2019re choosing your schedule. If you are a morning person, choose a section that meets in the morning when you are awake and ready to learn. If the best section fills up before you can schedule it, try speaking directly to the professor and explaining why it\u2019s important for you to attend class at that particular time.\n\n\nMany people tend to lose focus after lunch time so if you\u2019re not a morning person choose a section between 10am and 12pm or after 3pm.\n\n, If you have the opportunity to do so, taking the class on its own allows you to spend all of your time and energy on truly understanding algebra. Not having to split your attention between multiple courses lets you focus specifically on the task at hand.\n\n\nIf you really want to succeed at a four-year college, take college algebra at a community college the summer before to gain a solid foundation in math.\n\n, Homework, quizzes, and exams will likely have different point values associated with them. Knowing what percentage each contributes to your grade can help you further in the course if you are struggling. Avoid falling behind because you didn\u2019t put in the time to do the homework properly!\n\n\nDetermine how much time you will need to spend each week to really master the course. Make sure to set aside this time by scheduling it into your day.\n\n, Pre-algebra includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. These concepts are essential for understanding the more complicated algebraic concepts.\n\n\nFind online tutorials that have quizzes associated with them to ensure your mastery of this material.\n\n, Give yourself a head start on the material by looking through the book before the course begins. If you have time, work through some of the concepts and identify the ones that are particularly difficult for you.\n\n\nBy getting ahead in your College Algebra (or any other math) studies you will have already worked through some problems and you will have intelligent questions to ask your teacher about the material.\nIf your bookstore stocks them, buy a copy of the student solution manual. This will make your homework sessions much easier.\n\n, Your professor didn\u2019t spend all of that time putting together a syllabus for no reason. The syllabus is a roadmap to the entire course, telling you what material will be covered each class, when homework is due, and when quizzes and exams will be.\n\n\nWrite down all class times, study sessions, quizzes, exams, and project due dates in your planner. This helps you keep track of when everything is due and helps you make academics a priority. Pay special attention to exam study sessions and exams that fall outside of your normal schedule and\/or class location.\nMake sure you have enough time to take algebra. A good rule of thumb is to schedule two hours of homework and studying for every hour of class. If you do not have enough time to take this class due to other commitments in your life, either make time for this class or wait until you do have the time.\n\n, Refer back to your syllabus to see what part of the textbook will be covered during your next class. Read that section and work some of the problems to check your understanding. Take some notes during your reading to refer back to while studying for quizzes and exams.Come to class prepared to ask questions about the parts that you didn\u2019t understand.\n\n, If you don't go to class, it's much harder to learn on your own. Math is a cumulative subject, so if you don't know the foundation, it's difficult to grasp later concepts.Just going to class is not enough, you also need to actively pay attention.\nPay special attention during demonstrations. Some algebra concepts are best when demonstrated. It is hard to use words to describe how a circle, an ellipse, a parabola and a hyperbola can come from the same cone, but when the professor takes out a model and shows you how to \"cut\" the cone, conic sections are much easier to understand.\n\n, Write down or draw everything your professor presents on the board as well as any verbal hints they give. Write or draw everything the exact same way the professor writes or draws it on the board. This will help you study your notes later. If the professor asks a question in class, think about it and answer it if you know it.\n\n\nAsk questions if you are confused. It is likely that other students have the same question you do.\nReview your notes frequently to solidify your comprehension of the material. If there is something you can\u2019t quite grasp, ask your professor for help.\n\n, Do all of the homework, even if it is not collected or graded. Homework is practice for exams. When you do your homework, you study for the test at the same time. Just reading your notes may be enough for other courses, but it is not enough to help you pass algebra.Check the homework when you are done. If you have the student solutions manual, you can see how to do each problem step by step. If you do not have a student solutions manual, your book will have the answers at the back of the book. Make sure you get the problems right before moving on to the next section.\nAsk questions on the homework. Write a list of problems that you had while doing the homework and take it to the next class. Make sure you give the questions a good try first; you may be able to solve them yourself.\n\n, Your math professor may show your class how to use a specific calculator or computer program. Learn the program or instrument inside out. If you have been out of school for even a few years since your last math class, make sure you know how to use the most recent calculators or programs. Find an online tutorial for more practice.\n\n, Understanding how to represent functions of a graph is key to understanding algebra. With graph paper, you can learn important graphing and visualization skills. These skills will help you in algebra and any higher math class.\n\n, Office hours are time set aside specifically by your professor to help you if you have questions. Take advantage of this one-on-one time if there is a concept you are really struggling with. Try to figure out exactly what it is you don\u2019t understand instead of just walking in and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d.Alternatively, you can use the math lab if your school has one. Visit it to find help when you need it. If you are afraid of asking the staff members in the lab, ask the student workers (if they are available); almost every student math lab worker has taken algebra. Try to come in during times of less traffic so that you don't have to wait for help.\n\n, Many community colleges and universities have a certain number of free tutoring hours offered to students. Find a time that works best for you and attend a session. If you\u2019re struggling with a particular topic, focus on that until it makes sense.\n\n\nFind out about your college\u2019s policy at the beginning of the year. You may lose the tutoring privileges if you don\u2019t use them in the first semester.\n\n, If you have the time and the capacity, a study group is a great way to stay on top of the material. Study groups are also good for working through homework and complex concepts. Someone in your group may understand something really well and be able to explain it to you in a way that clarifies the concept for you.Set up a weekly or every other week meeting time.\n\n, A short one-on-one tutoring session can be more beneficial to you than hours of group work in class because it allows you to focus specifically on what doesn\u2019t make sense. Although it may seem expensive, it is usually cheaper to pay for tutoring than to pay for retaking the course later.\n\n\nFind a tutor that fits and understands your learning style. If you start with one tutor and it isn\u2019t working for you, don\u2019t hesitate to find another one.\n\n, Using a test from a previous year is a great way to get more practice for the exam. It will give you an idea of the format of the exam and the difficulty of the questions. Work the test questions and then check your answers. What you got wrong is your lesson plan for concepts to work on.\n\n, Not only do the quizzes and homework count for a grade, but they are also good practice for the final exam. When you get a quiz or homework back, check to see what you did wrong. Do the problems again for practice and make sure you don't make the same mistakes again.A good quiz average may also help you pass if your test grades are on the pass\/fail fence. You\u2019ll be less likely to make the same mistake a second time if you\u2019ve reworked the problems.\n\n, Before an exam, most professors will put together a review assignment that covers all of the topics that you will see on the test. Completing the review will give you an idea of the topics you really understand and the ones you might need to study a little more before exam day.\n\n\nUse all the resources you have available to you to finish the review and study. Refer to your notes, textbook, previous homework assignments, and online help if necessary.\n\n, If you don\u2019t show the work of how you arrived at an answer, you are at risk of getting the whole question wrong even if you just added the last two numbers at the end incorrectly.\n\n\nShowing your work lets the professor know that you understand the concept, you may have just made a small arithmetic error.\n\n, If you come across a problem that you are unsure of, skip it and move on. You can always go back to those problems at the end of the test and focus on them once you\u2019ve answered everything else. Don\u2019t forget that you can also ask questions during the exam. Your professor may not be able to answer it, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\n\n, If you have stayed on a consistent study schedule, you won\u2019t need to cram because you will have been reviewing everything all along. Make sure you aren\u2019t hungry during the test, either.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":811}

{"text":" Do you want something pre-built, or want to assemble your own? RTF stands for Ready To Fly and includes everything including controller and battery, while ARF is Almost Ready to Fly, which assembly and the purchase of all necessary electronics (servos, ESC, receiver, battery, etc.) separately. PNF stands for Plug-n-Fly, often requiring you to buy your own battery, receiver, and transmitter separately. Do you want electric or glow (gas)? If you want to build the entire plane yourself, kits are also available.;\n, Beginner planes are typically electric RTF trainers in the $50-$300 price range including battery and controller. A good Internet search is \"RTF trainer. If you have a brick-and-mortar hobby shop in your area, be sure to visit it. The employees there will be extremely helpful and knowledgeable, especially if it's a reputable store.\n\n, Most RC planes, even RTF ones, require a bit of assembly.\n\n, Turn on the transmitter, then the airplane. Check the direction of flight surfaces (have someone experienced check you).\n\n, There are different conventions about which stick does what. These are called \"modes,\" and there are 4 main ones - Mode 1, Mode 2 etc. It is best to use a mode which is used by any instructor or the most common to other flyers in your area. Mode 2 is the most commonly used mode in the US.\n\n,, Don't fly if the ribbon is parallel to the ground! Under 30 degrees is perfect.\n\n, If possible, launch INTO the wind. If you are taking off from a runway and the wind is perpendicular to the runway, it is possible to take off, but not advisable for a beginner.\n\n, Once the plane is almost floating above the ground, bring the elevators (usually up-down on the right side) up about 30% and let the plane get off the ground. If you're hand launching, advance the power to full and give the plane a straight level and firm (not too hard) toss into the air and quickly grab the controls. If you are still learning, have someone else launch your airplane for you so you can keep your hands on the sticks.\n\n, I usually fly what we call 3 mistakes high, which is 150\u2013200 feet (45.7\u201361.0\u00a0m) up, then reduce the throttle to half power.\n\n, Just push the stick over for a split second and release. Simulator training will make you better at this.\n\n, This will roll the plane slightly to the side. You will also need to pull back on the appropriate control stick slightly to pull the plane through the turn. To complete the turn, roll the plane parallel to the ground. Remember to always keep the plane upwind, this way it won\u2019t blow away from you.(this only applies if you turn with ailerons.\n\n, If you do stall, recover by pushing the nose down until the aircraft is flying fast enough to generate lift again. This may seem counterintuitive, but pulling back on the stick further will only make your situation worse in a stall.\n\n, When you find yourself comfortable with this pattern, try flying an oval in the opposite direction (let other pilots around know what you are doing so they know to avoid you if you are flying an opposite pattern). When comfortable with both directions try a figure 8 pattern.\n\n, Reduce power slowly (don\u2019t touch the (elevator) stick - to descend, simply reduce the throttle). You want the plane to almost glide on its own. When the plane is about 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) from the ground, cut the throttle.\n\n, Note that this only applies to aircraft with a tailwheel, tricycle-gear airplanes should touch down on the back two wheels first and then let the nose settle down onto the runway.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":813}
{"text":" This is usually a multiple of 100 (most often 500), but players can determine it to be lower or higher depending on how long they want the game to last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You can have more or fewer, but tournament Spades is usually played in groups of four. If playing in teams, players should sit across from each other. This works best at a square table with a player on each side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Though not required, Spades etiquette is that all players refrain from picking their cards up before all the cards are dealt out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the number of players is not a factor of 52, simply deal until everyone has the same maximum number of cards and discard the remainder.\n\n, If players wish to arrange their cards in order of suit or rank, they should take this opportunity to do so. Keep in mind that arranging your cards too hastily can reveal information about your hand to the other players that you don't want them to know, so be discreet!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Bidding consists of a player looking at their cards and determining how many tricks they think they can win. For example, if you bid two tricks, you're betting that you'll win at least two tricks. If your game of Spades involves partners, you and your partner's bids are combined into a contract. If you bid two tricks and your partner bids three, the two of you have to win a total of five tricks to complete your contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first player to bid is typically the one to the left of the dealer, proceeding in a clockwise direction.\nMake sure to write down the bids so you don't forget who bid what as the game goes on.\nEvery player must bid at least one trick; you cannot pass unless you are playing the nil bids variant of the game (see below).\n\n, In customary Spades games, each player has to bid that they'll take at least one trick. One variant of this is to allow nil bids or blind nil bids. Agree upon this variation before bidding begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA nil bid is bidding that you won't take any tricks. A player might get a bonus of 100 points, for example, if they bid nil and don't take any tricks, and a penalty of -100 if they do take at least one trick.\nA blind nil bid is when you bet that you won't take any tricks before looking at your cards. In some variations, a player bidding blind nil may exchange two cards from his or her hand with a partner.In some variations, a player may only bid blind nil if they are behind by at least 100 points.\n\nBlind nil bids that are successfully met get 200 points; blind nil bids that are overdrawn get -200 points.\n\n\n\n\n, Going in a clockwise direction, the first player puts down a card from their hand. This card cannot be a spade, since this is the trump suit for all other cards. Players put down cards one after the other, following the suit of the first card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if Player 1 leads with the 7 of Clubs, each other player, if possible, must put down a club this round. Although the other players cannot see your cards, it is impossible \u2014 and bad etiquette \u2014 to lie about which suits you have, as players will keep track if you fail to put down the lead suit.\n\n\n, In Spades, cards are valued according to face-value: Ace is the highest and 2 is the lowest card value. For each trick, the player who lays down the highest card value takes all the cards, sets them face down next to their area, and records one trick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, in a trick which contains the 3 of spades (lead card), 8 of spades, 10 of spades, and K of spades, the player who put down the K wins the trick.\nIn a trick which contains the 5 of hearts (lead card), the 2 of hearts, the 6 of hearts, and the 4 of hearts, the player who put down the 6 wins the trick.\n\n\n, If a trick is lead with a 4 of diamonds, and the next player in line does not have a single diamond card, s\/he has the option of either discarding from a non-trump suit (a club or heart, in this case), or trumping with a spade. If a spade is played, the highest spade wins the trick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a trick which contains the 6 of hearts (lead card), 7 of hearts, Q of clubs, and K of diamonds, the player who put down the 7 of hearts wins the trick.\nIn a trick which contains the J of clubs (lead card), 2 of spades, 6 of clubs, and 3 of spades, the player who put down the 3 of spades wins the trick.\n\n\n, Common rules dictate that players can lead with any suit except for spades, as these are trump cards. This rule is set is place in order to prevent a player with a glut of trumps to use them, one after the other, early on, thereby depleting other players' trumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, At this point, all cards should be absent and tricks should be divided among the players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Count the total number of tricks you won. (Each trick should be a set of four cards, so divide your total cards by four to get the total number of tricks.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you bet five tricks, and you won at least five tricks, multiply the number of contracts by 10 to get your score. (Four bid tricks and four won tricks gives you a point total of 40.) If you bid five tricks, for example, but only collected four tricks, multiply the number of tricks bid by 10, but turn that into a negative number. (Four bid tricks but only three tricks won gives you -40 points.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If, for example, you bid three tricks and win four, you receive 30 points for meeting your bid, but an extra point for exceeding it. You'll therefore have 31 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have a total of 10 sandbag points, you're penalized 100 points. This total runs throughout the game, so be careful about winning extra tricks!\n\n, Play continues in this fashion until one person\/team reaches the score set at the beginning of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":814}
{"text":", (And, it helps if you understand at least the basic chords and some music theory for harmony, etc.)\n\n, You have to make the chords fit the melody notes -- not the other way around. Try to avoid clashing notes. There are several ways to do this. If the song has a \"left hand\" look in it, and if the structure isn't too complicated, listen to the section you're putting a chord into and decide if it is major or minor.\n\n, Unless the song is really complicated, one of those should fit. By simply analyzing the section in which you're placing a chord, the tonic (first note, I) of the melody chord\/key will usually be seen here and there in the bar(s) of the melody where you are looking to fit your chord.\n\n, For the minor scales the roman numerals for chords are lowercase i-iv-v: that's the tonic(i) sub-dominant(iv) and dominant(v)... Write these down somewhere so you can refer to them, because they will come up a lot in theory of harmony!\n\n, You can start by using chords I and V (first and fifth) \"of the scale of the key\" are very commonly used. So the 1st chord of the scale for the key C Major is the tonic (I) \"C Major\" chord (C-E-G) and then chord \"(V) is G Major\" (G-B-D) and so use whichever sounds better in progressions upward and downward in different parts of the song...\n\n,\n\n\nJust repeat these chords to the beat if you're not sure, and write down the one that sounds the nicest. Don't be afraid to mix them around if you find another chord sounds nicer!\n\n, The chord is highly dependent on which melody notes are being used in that part of the song. So an understanding of theory is helpful -- if for example: the notes of the melody are in the key of C (C-E-G) then you have the sub-dominant \"4th chord (F)\" which fits right in, or chord the \"fifth chord (G)\", and of course \"B (the VII)\" may work as it closely relates to \"G7\", and naturally D, F chords may be comfortable, all being in, of or near C Major.\n\n, Thus, depending on what notes are used like high notes \"G or A\" in the melody then the second inversion of the C chord could accompany this group.\n\n, If, however, the higher notes (E, F, or sometimes G) are used, the first inversion of C would be played to give a different tonality.\n\n, Many a musician can play in a rhythm section -- does not read much music -- but learns and plays harmony to the melody by blending among other instrumentalists by ear (improvising).\n\n\nThe notes of the melody are not the first consideration for strumming, picking, and arpeggio piano chording kind of musician... who is in key and harmonizes to the key, but is not really \"clued\" to knowing the exact melody line or harmony theory...\n\nOne may be a good recording session player or band member par excellence by knowing chords inside and out without reading the sheet music, ie: for purposes of commercial\/professional entertainment or church music!\n\n\n\n, This allows playing chords in any key as the tonic to a melody and to allow easy key changes by counting up and down by musical steps and 1\/2 steps (sharps and flats)...\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":815}

This depends based on what you plan to do with your picture. JPG is a good option for photographs or images with lots of colors. If you only use a few colors and not much detail, GIFs are versatile and have small file sizes. If you\u2019re only planning to use this image in Paint, you can save it as a Bitmap (.bmp), which is the default file type.\n\n\nYou can always convert your images to a different file format later. See How to Convert Pictures to JPEG or Other Picture File Extensions.\n\n, The assortment of colored squares at the top of the screen is the color palette. Clicking a color will select that color as the foreground (main) color for any tool you use in Paint. You can also set a background color for when you start working with shapes.\n\n\nWindows 7 and later: The foreground is called \u201cColor 1,\u201d the background \u201cColor 2.\u201d To choose a foreground color, click \u201cColor 1\u201d and select any color from the palette. For a background color, click \u201cColor 2\u201d and click any color.\nWindows Vista or below: Find the two overlapping colored boxes to the left of the palette. The front box is the foreground color, the back box is the background. Set the background color by right-clicking the color of your choice.\n\n,\n\n\nTo draw a straight line, click the Straight Line tool, then choose a color from the palette. Click anywhere in your canvas. While holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse away from that first click in any direction.

If you\u2019re erasing a red line on a white background, for example, make sure the background color is set to white.\n\n, Select any shape from the toolbar to draw that shape. Once you\u2019ve chosen a shape, you\u2019ll notice some options for the shape\u2019s appearance.\n\n\nIn Windows 7 or above, click the \u201cOutline\u201d and \u201cFill\u201d menus to view your (slightly more varied) options. If you\u2019re using Windows Vista or an earlier version, you\u2019ll see an outline of a shape, an outline of a shape around a filled-in color, and a solid-colored shape.\nSelect your preferred outline and fill options, then click the canvas where you\u2019d like to place your shape. Hold down the mouse button as you drag the cursor to enlarge the shape. Let go of the mouse button when you reach the desired shape size.\nIf you chose a shape with an outline, the color of the outline will be the current foreground color.

Try creating a square or circle with the shape tool in one color, then use the Fill tool to change the color of just that shape.\n\n, There are two different tools you can use to select parts of your image: Freeform Select (a dotted outline of oval-ish shape) and Rectangular Select (a dotted outline of a rectangle). Freeform allows you to draw your own freehand selection line around an image, while the rectangular selection tool lets you draw a rectangle.\n\n\nIn Windows 7 and later, click the arrow beneath \u201cSelect\u201d and choose \u201cRectangular\u201d or \u201cFreeform.\u201d In Windows Vista and earlier, you\u2019ll see both on your toolbar.\nTo use either tool, start by clicking at the top left corner of your image, then hold the mouse button as you trace your way around. The rectangular selection will be fairly quick, but you\u2019ll need to be more deliberate to trace manually with the freeform tool. Let go of the mouse button when you\u2019re done selecting.\n\n, Copy the selected area by pressing Ctrl+C. Paste it somewhere else (in Paint or in other compatible programs, like Microsoft Word or Power Point) by clicking a new location and pressing Ctrl+V.\n\n\nIf you don\u2019t want the background color to be a part of your selection:\n\nWindows 7 and later: Check \u201cTransparent Selection\u201d in the Select menu.\nWindows Vista or earlier: Find the two icons that feature multicolored shapes with a \u201cselection\u201d rectangle on top. Click to highlight bottom (transparent) of the two icons. To disable this later, click back to the top selection icon.\n\n\n\n, Select the Text tool, which is signified by the letter \u201cA,\u201d then double-click somewhere on the canvas to start typing.\n\n\nA dotted text box with square boxes on each corner will appear. Make sure the text in the text box is exactly the way you want it before switching to another tool (you\u2019ll be unable to edit text after closing the text box.\nTo increase the text box size (which will give you more room to type), hold the mouse over one of the square corners until the cursor turns to an arrow, then drag the box to a larger size.\nChoose a font face and size from the top of the screen and begin typing. To change the color, size or face of the text after you type, highlight the text, then choose the new color, size, etc. When you\u2019re typing, click somewhere outside of the text box to leave the tool.\n\n, You can distort an image with the \u201cskew\u201d feature. Click \u201cImage,\u201d then select \u201cResize\/Skew\u201d (if you\u2019re using Windows 7 or later, just click \u201cResize\u201d on the toolbar). To stretch\/distort the image by degree, type a number (in degrees) in the boxes marked \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical.\n\n, The small eyedropper icon represents the Color Picker tool. Click this tool, then click somewhere in your drawing. The area you click will now become the foreground color for your next tool of choice.\n\n, You can edit any of the colors by adjusting their hue, brightness and other options in the Paint color mixer. Click \u201cEdit colors\u201d or \u201cDefine custom colors\u201d to enter the color mixer. When you\u2019ve decided on a color you like, click \u201cAdd to custom colors.\u201d\n\n, Drawing symmetrically isn\u2019t easy when you\u2019re using a mouse, so you may want to give yourself some guidelines. Click the \u201cView\u201d tab, then put a checkmark next to \u201cRuler\u201d to see horizontal and vertical rulers around your canvas. Put a check next to \u201cGridlines\u201d to create a grid on your canvas.

{"text":" They are self-serving, arrogant and a bit intimidating. They command people left and right, even when they are not in the position to be giving the orders. (See the Enemy Within, char: Charles Kawalsky);\n, Be arrogant, but do not be a bastard. There is a difference.\n\n, They are known for their elaborate clothing. Take a look at the clothing of people today if they go into battle. Tight, form fitting, usually pants. The Goa'uld (even the male personality ones) wear things like long dresses and loose clothing. They don't fight using strength and hand to hand combat because they have technology that allows them to pwn your face from afar. It's kind of ridiculous seeing that the symbiote gives the body increased strength and everything.\n\n, They wore chain mail looking outfits showing no more than their hands and face. In the movie, Stargate, the guards wore schenti, sandals, a top (usually midriff bearing) and their totem masks.\n\n, In today's world, that's your choice. Many people are starting to get interested in the older style of things, so you may not look too alienated if you went the elaborate clothing style versus the war mode style.\n\n,, They'd be very commanding and intimidating, blasting people around with their hand device and ribboning everyone into submission.\n\n, This is the chainmail style that looks reminiscent of Ancient Egyptian style, but updated for the sci-fi look.\n\n, They achieved the blend of sci-fi and Ancient Egyptian culture very well. I think it was probably the colors and the fact they wore actual loin cloths instead of a weird rigid schenti.\n\n, Take an acting class to learn how to speak more fluidly and move in a controlled manner. Walk and talk slow as if the world needs to slow down and move at your pace. Learn to control conversations you enter into. Act mostly non-interested in other people and as if you have more important things to attend to.\n\n, Acting like a Goa'uld can lead you to be loved by many people because if done correctly, you can come off very strong and sure of yourself rather than a tyrant and rude bastard.\n\n, Apophis was not above making Sokar think he was all loyal and following of him. Therefore to be a Goa'uld you must be cunning and sneaky. Never let anyone in on your plans unless they have undying loyalty for you. Note: This can not be a person who is of very high self esteem or arrogant themselves, it may eventually lead into a battle of who is more powerful of the two of you, literally. Conceal your motives.\n\n, Money is power in today's world. Money can earn you the loyalty and respect of people because they follow the person with the most paper in their pockets. These are the flunkies that eat out of every rich person's palm. Get wealthy and then protect your wealth. Invest and build a literal empire.\n\n, So, do not neglect your followers. Goa'uld mostly played on their claim to divinity and using their technology to look Godlike. Unfortunately, this tech is not available to do that. So, do not treat your underlings like crap. That's why there are many revolts going along. Listen to your followers, do not allow them to get out of line, but listen to them. People will follow a reasonable ruler who is down their in the fray with them rather than a removed ruler who makes it appear as if they do not matter to them.\n\n, Goa'uld are not real and neither is Stargate. Behaving too strictly to this list may earn you a beating from people who don't like your attitude. Don't pick up behaviors that you can't back up.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":818}
{"text":" Every baby experiences diaper rash at one point or another. Over half of babies experience a diaper rash at least once every two months. Learn to recognize the most common symptoms of diaper rash so that you can begin to treat it immediately. Symptoms of diaper rash include:\n\n\nBright pink or red skin around your baby's groin, thighs, and bottom\nDry, inflamed skin around the diaper area\nBumps or sores\nYour baby might also act fussier than usual when experiencing diaper rash;\n, Many diaper rashes can clear up on their own, as long as you use proper diapering techniques. You can avoid using diaper cream if you make sure your baby's diaper is changed frequently and that your baby's skin is clean and exposed to the open air. Proper diapering technique involves:\n\n\nChanging diapers frequently \u2014 about every two hours or so, and after every poopWashing your baby's bottom gently with warm water: do not rely solely on baby wipes to clean stool off of the skinOnly using a mild soap when cleaning stool off of the skin: do not use soap every time you wash your baby's bottomUsing baby wipes that are unscented and alcohol free\nGiving your baby a lot of naked time to allow the skin to dry and breathePatting your baby dry instead of rubbing (rubbing can irritate the skin)Fastening a new diaper only after your baby's skin is completely dry and has had some time to breathe\nMaking sure the fresh diaper is loose, not tight, on your baby's skinWashing cloth diapers very thoroughly to prevent the spread of bacteria \u2014 a vinegar rinse can help kill rash-causing bacteriaWashing your hands thoroughly after every diaper change, Most babies do not require diaper cream at every diaper change. In many cases, diaper rash can be prevented by making sure that your baby's skin is dry, clean, has exposure to the open air, and does not come into contact with stool.However, all babies who wear diapers will experience a rash at some point. If your baby only experiences diaper rash occasionally, use the cream when you see symptoms of diaper rash begin to develop: you will not need to use it as a preventive measure.\n\n, Some infants are especially susceptible to diaper rash. If your baby experiences consistent, ongoing diaper rashes despite your reasonable precautions and proper diapering technique, you can consider applying diaper cream at each diaper change. It is possible that your baby has sensitive skin and requires extra skin protection., Diaper cream is very useful when your baby is experiencing a bout of diarrhea. Diarrhea can make it difficult for you to change diapers frequently enough to prevent a diaper rash, and the consistency of diarrhea makes it more likely to cause widespread skin irritation on your baby's bottom.If your baby has diarrhea, apply diaper cream between changes as a preventive measure.If your baby has serious, ongoing diarrhea, talk to your pediatrician. You do not want your baby to become dehydrated.\n\n, Certain kinds of diaper cream are very thick: this can help prevent irritation. Other kinds of diaper cream are thinner and drier: this can help provide increased airflow to the affected area. In order to determine what consistency is best for your baby, talk to your doctor. He or she should have some sage advice about whether your baby's rash will do best with a thick paste or a thinner cream., Diaper creams can be purchased at most drug stores and supermarkets. If you care for an infant, you should have a tube of diaper cream handy to help prevent and heal diaper rashes. Look for a diaper cream with ingredients such as zinc oxide, calendula, and aloe: these substances help to soothe and protect red and inflamed skin.Petroleum jelly and other mineral oils are also common, safe ingredients.If your child has any allergies or skin sensitivities, be sure you read the ingredients of the diaper cream carefully to ensure that it doesn't make the rash worse. For example, babies with a wool allergy should not be exposed to diaper creams made with lanolin.\nMost diaper creams are designed for use with disposable diapers. If you use cloth diapers, make sure that the diaper cream you purchase explicitly states that it is safe to use with cloth diapers.Only use creams that explicitly state that they are safe for infants. Stay away from adult-strength creams or any creams that contain boric acid, baking soda, camphor, benzocaine, diphenhydramine, or salicylates. These ingredients can be harmful to young children., Some babies are sensitive to certain common ingredients in diaper creams. If one kind of cream seems to irritate your baby's skin, try another brand with different ingredients. Use trial-and-error and careful observation to determine which kinds of cream are the best for your baby.\n\n\nThis advice also applies to other substances your baby will encounter, such as laundry detergents, soaps, cleansers, and fabrics. If you are having trouble finding cleansers that do not irritate your baby's skin, try to find unscented, alcohol-free substances that are hypoallergenic.\n\n, Even if you purchase a non-toxic diaper cream, it is not safe for your baby or toddler to ingest. Make sure that you store your diaper cream in a place where your baby cannot suck on it or grab it, such as a high shelf or a baby-proof drawer. Keep your tube of diaper cream sealed with a safety lid.\n\n, The best time to apply diaper cream is during diaper changes. Parents of very young infants will have to change their diapers every two hours and after every poop. Slightly older infants and toddlers might require less frequent diaper changes, since they do not urinate as frequently. Especially if your child has diaper rash or sensitive skin, you have to make sure that poopy diapers are changed as soon as possible: stool is the worst culprit of diaper rashes and skin irritation.If you baby has a rash, check your baby's diaper every hour during the day and once during the night to make sure it isn't dirty., It will be easier for you and safer for your baby if all of your supplies are within easy reach. Having your supplies close to hand means that you are less likely to have to leave your baby unattended during a diaper change. The supplies you need include:\n\n\nA clean diaper\nA towel or changing mat\nDiaper cream\nWarm water, or unscented, alcohol free baby wipes\nSoft towels or washcloths\nA waterproof bag or wastebasket for the soiled diaper\n\n, Do not leave your baby unattended on any high surface. If your baby has diaper rash, it might be best to change your baby on a towel on the floor. That will make it easier for your baby to have some naked time later on.\n\n\nIf you use a surface above the floor, such as a changing table, ensure you buckle the child safely onto the table or mat.\n\n, Take off any shoes or pants, and unsnap any body suits. Pull shirts up and out of the diaper area. You want to keep the area totally clear: this will help prevent your baby's clothes from becoming soiled. Diaper creams may stain, and removing clothing will help prevent unnecessary staining as well.\n\n, Unfasten the pins of cloth diapers or the tabs of disposable diapers. Open the soiled diaper and pull it down and out from under your child. Hold on to the baby's legs to prevent them from accidentally kicking into a soiled diaper. You want your baby to remain as clean and bacteria-free as possible., A baby with a diaper rash will have very raw, sensitive skin. However, it is necessary to clean this skin thoroughly to make sure that she can heal properly. It is also necessary for you to clean away any old or stiff diaper cream from the last time you applied. Do not use scented or alcoholic baby wipes. Warm water is the best way to clean a baby with diaper rash. You can use a mild, scent-free soap if your baby had a particularly messy bowel movement.Use a squirt bottle filled with warm water to clean your baby. This helps prevent irritation from scrubbing or rubbing. You can also soak your baby's bottom in a tub of warm water for a few minutes. This will help soothe her bottom as well as cleanse it properly.Make sure that all urine, stool, and residue from earlier applications of diaper cream are removed.\nIf you have to use a cloth to finish removing traces of stool from your baby, be sure that you use a soft cloth, that you are very gentle, and that you rub front to back: never clean a baby from back to front., Using a very soft towel, pat your baby dry with a gentle blotting motion. Do not rub or scrub: this can irritate the skin further. Moisture helps to feed the bacteria that cause diaper rash, so your baby must be as dry as possible.\n\n, Keep the child's bottom exposed to the air for as long as possible. Exposing your baby to the air is one of the best ways to prevent and heal diaper rash. Her skin will be able to dry and breathe, and the air discourages the growth of bacteria and fungus. If possible, give your baby at least 10 minutes of naked time during each diaper change., Get the new diaper ready to fasten beneath your baby's bottom and legs. Lift up his legs and slide the clean diaper underneath. Position the tabs at the back so that they are at the same level as the belly button.When your baby is experiencing serious diaper rash, you might want to consider going up a size in diaper for the next few days. A loose diaper will help encourage airflow and healing, and will prevent a buildup of moisture., You can choose to use a glove or a clean tissue if you wish. Spread the cream onto any inflamed areas and in the immediately surrounding skin. Pay particular care to apply the cream around the anus, genital area, and folds of skin around the thighs. Feel free to apply as much cream as necessary to cover the skin beneath a diaper. The cream should create a nice thick layer to protect the rash from moisture. Just as with cleaning your baby, try to apply the cream using front-to-back motions instead of back-to-front motions: this will help prevent uterine tract infections in your baby.\n\n\nTry to avoid touching raw or inflamed skin too often: simply dab it on and avoid rubbing or touching it further.\nSome diaper creams have a nozzle that will allow you to squeeze the cream directly onto your baby. This can be especially useful if your baby has particularly raw or sensitive skin that you do not want to irritate by touching directly.\nIf your doctor has given you prescription medication, be sure to follow her instructions. There are some ointments that are designed to work alongside over-the-counter diaper creams, while other ointments replace over-the-counter diaper creams. Ask your doctor how a prescription cream and diaper cream might work together., Some diaper creams are quite sticky, which can cause a baby's diaper to stick to her skin. This might cause further irritation. To help decrease this stickiness and to encourage proper airflow, consider adding a layer of petroleum jelly. A small coating of petroleum jelly on top of the diaper cream will keep your baby's diaper fitting loosely and flexibly, which will encourage healing.You may even choose to use petroleum jelly as the diaper cream in some cases.\n\n, Pull the front of the clean diaper up and even with the back. Fasten tabs at a comfortable yet secure tightness. You want the diaper to be a bit looser than normal to help encourage healing and to prevent chafing.\n\n, Once your baby has been cleaned, changed, and has fresh diaper cream, you can dress him in whichever clothing you like. It is good to give your baby as much naked time as possible, however \u2014 aim for at least 30 minutes a day of naked time.\n\n\nIf your baby soiled his clothing, be sure that you give him brand-new clothes. You do not want bacteria to spread and worsen the diaper rash.\n\n, Because diaper rashes are caused in part by the spread of bacteria, you have to make sure that everything is clean after the diaper change. Your baby's clothing, the changing table, your baby's hands and feet, and your own hands all have to be thoroughly washed if they came into contact with your baby's stool or urine. Use warm water and soap to wash your hands (and your baby's hands, if necessary). Dispose properly of any soiled items, and place soiled cloths in the laundry to be washed.\n\n, A regular diaper rash should be gone within three days of treatment.However, sometimes skin infections, fungal infections, or allergic reactions can look similar to diaper rash: these conditions will require different medication and more time to treat. If your diaper cream is not relieving your infant's symptoms, talk to a pediatrician. You might need to switch diaper creams, perform an allergy test, or get a prescription-strength medication to resolve the issue.If you notice any abnormal symptoms--such as fever, pus, or open sores--talk to a pediatrician immediately.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":819}
{"text":" If the online ticket purchase gives you the option to print out your boarding pass, this is recommended, especially if you are not checking bags.;\n, Make your bag identifiable by tying a ribbon on it or putting a tag on it, or use a colorful\/unique bag.\n\n\nWhen you pack any liquid items on your carry-on, such as lotion, shampoo, body oils, etc. Make sure they are 3 oz. or less. Keep them together in a plastic Ziploc bag. Remember the rule 3-1-1, containers must be 3.4 ounces or less, stored in a 1 quart\/liter zip-top bag and only 1 zip-top bag per person.\n\n, This is in case of delays getting to the airport, checking in, or clearing security.\n\n, Get in line and wait until you are asked to come forward. There is usually a bin that allows you to see if your luggage is small enough to go on the plane or if you have to check it. Also, keep in mind you may only have one piece of luggage and one smaller carry-on item. Have your ID on hand.\n\n, If your luggage to check, place it on the nook in the counter when asked to. The agent will tag it, and either will place it on the conveyor belt behind the counter, or tell you to carry it over to a scanner. If not, tell her you have nothing to check. In either case, she will then hand you your boarding pass unless you printed it online.

{"text":" Plan to have family worship, sing spiritual songs and have quiet time with Christ together, worshiping God and developing your walk in Christ. Be sure to study the Bible and to praise God for your opportunities and for giving you your very life. Have a personal relationship with Jesus. Anything that goes wrong pray to Him and lean not on your own understanding. Proverbs 3:5;\n, is based upon loving \"Jesus\", \"Others\" and then lastly, \"Yourself\"-\"but not least,\" as the Bible says you are \"to love others 'as you love yourself'.\" So love yourself as much as you love others and then you have the winning concept straight from Christ! This, for example, also means do not try to directly control your husband or other people (try gentle persuasion). J.O.Y. also means that you should not judge wrongly or harshly, but you will forgive yourself and others.\n\n, The Bible says: \"Stay in a habit of attending church regularly\" with your husband or alone (or with girlfriends), if necessary. \"Pray for each other.\" Pray together and \"pray without ceasing\" and \"honor Christ in all you do and say\"... Our physical lives are in Christ and spiritually \"His life on this earth is in us and we are in Him.\" He is \"at the right hand of the Father in Heaven where He is always interceding for us.\" (Romans 8:34)\n\n, Criticizing and putting yourself down to your husband or in front of him in public is a way of insulting his taste in women. Realize that if he is with you, it's because he chose you and wants to be with you. He finds you sexy enough, even if you don't feel like you are; so be there for him. Remember that attitude and willingness are important parts of feeling and being sexy. Poor self-esteem leaves a hole in your life that is terrible for your marriage. Make sure you continue to actually have occasional fun and help each other have an interesting life together, not just trying to control each other or only teasing about fun. Tease nicely, and mean it. Have a sense of humor.\n\n, Will you still have girlfriends you see at least once a week, your special church group that you go to, full days and busy evenings? If you were not whole, your husband would always have to be trying to fill a hole in your life. Well, it's one that he won't ever fill, and you might both feel inadequate and unhappy, if you can't keep yourself up with friends and family as well as busy cheerfully serving Christ.\n\n, Except in case your husband reads minds, don't expect your husband to just know what you want. If you want or need something, ask and discuss it together. Don't just drop hints and figure that he'll get it and \"come around\" without communicating calmly, clearly and directly. If something is wrong for you, say so. Christian friendships and relationships work best when each partner calmly expresses their current emotion -- without harping on what the other did. Frequently, a \"I feel confused\", or \"I feel sad\" is all it takes for him to step back and ask, \"Why?\" Then simply say, \"When you slammed the door, I felt ignored (or insulted).\" Let \"I feel...\" be your key word. Avoid saying \"you\"--as in \"you made me sad.\" Say \"'That' made me feel sad.\" Take responsibility for your own needs and feelings.\n\n, He needs to keep trying to do well, and you need to keep trying also, but neither of you will ever be perfect. Unsatisfied expectations frustrate everyone. However, if you both continue to work on your marriage, you will always be involved in each others lives, even when one of you comes up a little short. If your expectations are truly too high, very idealistic or unrealistic, you should set standards that are obtainable. For example, it is unfair to expect to be lavished with possessions. Have the love of your life at home; staying home, try having home cooking at several meals per week versus going out to eat junk food instead.\n\n, Also, should you want more together time, be prepared to have that desire fulfilled with some effort, washing clothes and cleaning house together and relaxing together.\n\n, Nagging and nitpicking can destroy a relationship. As long as the dishes get clean and are unbroken, for instance: don't nag about how you want the dishwasher loaded--the \"the right way\". Let him do such things his own way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Focus on what is more important and don't be a complainer. Maybe explain the theory as you show him how you believe it needs to be done one time and then leave it alone.\"Wives, place yourselves under your husbands' authority as you have placed yourselves under the Lord's authority.\"(Ephesians 5:22) but only so far as he is not doing crimes, is not cruel or actually abusive (not the blame game...) to you, the children or other persons.\n\n, (Ephesians 5:25) If your husband is not showing love, do not demand attention or affection. Just ask cheerfully for some help and pick a time to give a playful or sexy hug and kiss: he may respond well, if he's not angry--or unless it is not the right place and time.\n\n, This affection and fun will carry over to when you have the chance and the time in private.\n\n, Be willing to try some innocent, new things (or even suggest\/approach it affectionately without asking) and discuss them - don't just turn down fun and harmless play when he suggests something you don't feel is appealing immediately. This may make him feel rejected or that you are not having fun. At least be willing to discuss it nicely, and perhaps try it, but never do anything you are uncomfortable with after discussing it with him. Also, don't be afraid to discuss anything you might be interested in. Physical intimacy is as important to a marriage as is \"emotional intimacy\". Nurture them both.\"Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.\" (1 Corinthians 7:5)\n\n, Accept him as he is, so that you have such deep respect and gratitude for him that you would never want him to change for you. He has so much to offer you, if you give him the space to be himself. He is a growing individual, just like you are. Help him grow in the direction that he chooses, and give him the chance to help you similarly.\n\n, \"And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with vanity about her hair and gold or jewels or expensive clothing;\" (1 Timothy 2:9) Encourage your husband to expect you to be modest in public and erotic in private with him. There is much temptation that results from women feeling as if they need to turn other men on and to show their sensual side in public. One thing may lead to another. Avoid immodesty.\n\n, Your spouse is not perfect and he will at times upset you, or even hurt your feelings. When this happens you have a choice to make; you either harbor offense and let your heart become hardened, or you can remember how patient and forgiving God is with you and forgive your husband just as you have been forgiven by The Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick to repent. Just as your husband is not perfect neither are you. The Bible says that \"God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble\" (James 4:6) It is so important in your relationship with your husband and with God that you be willing to humble yourself and ask for forgiveness when you are wrong, or have acted in an unloving way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick to believe. 1 Corinthians 13:7 says, \"it (love) always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Don't simply focus on the bad about your husband, but see him the way God sees him; focus on the attributes that you love about him and always believe and compliment him, such as: \"Honey, God is working in your heart, and so you are becoming more like Christ everyday.\" The trick is to believe this even when it doesn't look like it! That is real faith in action, believing God can bring it to reality even when you don't see it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":822}

{"text":" Although your child may not become a proficient swimmer until he's a few years old, you can start bringing him in the pool at a few months. From 6 to 12 months is usually considered a good time to introduce your child to the water because at this age children will absorb the skill faster. As long as you're gentle with your child and introduce him to the water gradually, you can begin as early as 6 months., Make sure your child, whatever his age, is healthy enough to begin swimming. If your child has any health conditions you should consult your doctor before beginning swimming lessons., If you have a young child just learning how to swim, you should be familiar with basic first aid. Knowing CPR can save your child's life., If your child is still in diapers, use a waterproof swim diaper to prevent any leaks and protect the health of other swimmers., Blow-up devices like water wings are popular, but not recommended by pediatricians. If these spring a leak while your child is swimming, he can sink. These devices can also slip off.Instead, use a U.S. Coast Guard-approved life vest. These should be available at most sporting goods and pool equipment stores.\n\n\nWhen buying a life vest, look for the U.S. Coast Guard-approved label. For small children, the vest should have straps that hook under the legs to keep it from slipping over the child's head., If you have a pool, make sure your child can't get to it. Learning how to swim may make your child overconfident of his abilities and he might try to swim when you're not looking. Avoid accidents by completely blocking access to the pool when it's not in use.\n\n, Infants require warm water, ideally between 85 and 92 degrees.If your pool isn't heated, you can try using a solar cover, which absorbs heat from the sun, to warm the pool.\n\n, You should introduce your child to the water gradually. Many people, adults and children, drown because they panic in the water. By slowly exposing your child to the water, you're helping him overcome that fear. This will help him stay calm when learning more advanced swimming skills., An enjoyable first time in the water will teach your child the joy of swimming. Play together with toys, teach him to splash, sing songs, and be attentive to make sure he is enjoying himself., Lock his arms around your neck while he's facing you and start walking slowly backwards.\n\n, With some practice, your child will learn to start kicking in the water by himself., He can best learn his own sense of buoyancy by remaining still in the water on his back, but at this stage he is sure to need your support.The most important part of learning this skill is getting him to relax., Carefully holding your child around the belly and being certain to keep his head above the water, you can both pretend he is a superhero flying.\n\n, Seeing that you can float will reassure your child it is possible. You should take a moment to describe that different parts of the body float better than others. Deeper breaths will make the lungs more buoyant, and the lower body usually sinks., Now that your child understands a little bit more about floating, have him get a sense for the buoyancy of other objects. Have your child push toys and other floating objects under the water and laugh with him as he makes bubbles and splashes.\n\n, Children are often uncomfortable with the sensation of the unsupported feeling of the back-float in water. A common reflex is to lift the head and bend at the waist, which will cause your child to sink., By resting your child\u2019s head on your shoulder and holding him carefully, you can practice floating together. Sing a relaxing song together can have a calming effect in addition to other positive benefits of being skin to skin with your child., He should be in front of you in case he panics. Count down from three, exhaling lightly to blow on his face on the count of one. This will serve as a signal to your child that you are about to turn him on his back and will help prevent panic.\n\n, Use your non-dominant hand to support his head, keeping it above water. Use the other to touch him in a reassuring way and offer support as necessary. He may squirm when placed in this position. Keep supporting him until he settles down.\n\n\nWhen he calms, little by little stop supporting his body while still holding his head. Allow him to float.\n\n, If you are emotional, it might appear you are validating your child\u2019s panic response. Use positive affirmations to restore clarity, saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019m here. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Smile and laugh to show him everything is alright.\n\n, This will familiarize him with being underwater and diminish his fear of it., Count to three and gently submerge his head. Bring it back up immediately.\n\n\nUse smooth motions. Jerky motions can hurt your child's neck.\nAllow your child to rest before doing this again.\n\n, If you are clearly nervous or scared, your child will believe the water is something to fear. At this stage, you want to stay positive and show him that he doesn't have to be afraid of the water., At this early age, your child can't swim independently. You should always be in the pool with him at this stage.\n\n, You can do this in the same fashion described for children under two. Help him overcome his initial fear and get him comfortable in the water. Once he is at ease, you can move on to some more advanced lessons.\n\n, At this age, your child should be able to understand what is and isn't allowed in the pool. Generally accepted pool rules include:No running\nNo horse-play\nNo diving\nSwim with a buddy\nStay away from drain covers and filters\n\n, Most drowning cases under five result from inadequate supervision., At this age, your child can understand descriptions of swimming activities. If he is ready for something new, he is more likely to absorb the lesson if he is given brief instruction ahead of time.Show the motions for swimming activities outside the water before getting in. You might want to address new sensations, like the sense of buoyancy that can be felt in the chest when floating, pressure in the ears, or the muffled quality of sound beneath the water.\n\n, Have your child submerge just his lips in the water and blow bubbles. This will help him with breath control and help prevent swallowing water as he starts learning to go underwater.If your child is hesitant, demonstrate this first. When you take your mouth out of the water, make sure you have a smile on your face. This will help show your child that there is nothing to be afraid of.\n\n, Tell your child to talk to the fish, make a noise like a tractor, or blow as many bubbles as he can in the water. This makes the lesson fun while you teach your child a valuable swimming skill., Stand facing your child. Hold his arms out in front of him. Then start walking backwards, having your child kick his feet as you move. Verbal cues like \"kick, kick, kick, kick\" can help your child remember this motion., This is a simplified, arms-only version of the freestyle, which is where you paddle with your arms while kicking with your legs. Have your child start by sitting on a pool step or ladder so the water is roughly up to his chest.\n\n, He should extend one arm straight out of the water and bring it above his head.\n\n, He should bring it back to the water in a downward slapping motion, making sure he keeps his fingers together as he drives his hand into and through the water.\n\n, Repeat this motion with the other arm. Direct him to use his arms like he would if he were really swimming.\n\n, Make sure he keeps his fingers together, so the fish don't escape., Standing a few feet into open water, hold your child with one hand on his chest and one around his waist. Count to three and glide him through the water towards the steps or ladder.\n\n\nWhile doing this, have him combine blowing bubbles, kicking his legs, and swimming with his arms. This will help him start using all the motions necessary for independent swimming., Holding onto the wall is a good way for him to make his way back to the shallows and also helps teach him to maneuver on his own. It shows him a safe place he can use to stay afloat if he falls in the water, gets tired, or is scared., Instead of just dipping his head under, you can now try to keep him under for a few seconds. This will teach him to hold his breath underwater. Make sure you tell him to close his eyes and mouth and hold his breath.\n\n\nRemember to explain what you're about to do to avoid scaring your child.\nNever put your child underwater unexpectedly. This will scare him and could make him afraid of the water.\n\n, After two or three seconds, bring him back up. You can increase this gradually as your child gets accustomed to it.If he seems hesitant, try counting to two or three to show him that he'll only be under the water for a very short time.\nIt may make your child more comfortable if you go under first. Remember to smile and laugh when you come back up so he knows there's nothing to be afraid of.\n\n, At this point, he has all the basic skills needed to start swimming, he just needs practice putting it all together. A life vest will allow him the freedom he needs to start combining all these techniques and swimming on his own.\n\n, Remember that even if your child is capable of swimming without you holding him, he should still never be left alone.\n\n, If he is comfortable in the water and is able to swim at or beyond the level described for 2 \u2013 4 year olds, then you can move on to more advanced swimming techniques.\n\n, This is a fun and simple swimming style that is often used by young children learning to swim.The ideal water level for the Dog Paddle is about chest high.\n\n, Making downward scooping motions with his fingers together, he should \u201cdig\u201d through the water while kicking his feet, much like a dog or a horse might swim.\n\n\nHave fun while learning the Dog Paddle by searching for videos of dogs swimming online.\n\n, Chances are he will try to fully extend his legs, but short, fast kicks offer more power. To improve form, have him point his toes while kicking., He might need support while learning to coordinate his arms and legs, but as he gains confidence you should supervise independent swimming.\n\n, To properly swim with both hands, your child will not be able to plug his nose while swimming. Start with a game to see who can make the most bubbles using only air blown out the nose!\n\n, In the beginning, your child might blow out all his air in one burst out of fear the water will rush up his nose. Stay close in case he accidentally takes on some water and needs your support.\n\n\nIn the event he has the unpleasant experience of getting water up his nose, respond appropriately. Give him warm encouragement by saying things like, \u201cThat happens sometimes. It\u2019s OK!\u201d\n\n, At this point, your child might not be the most coordinated underwater, but allow him to get a feel for moving around underwater without plugging his nose. This will make it easier for him to transition to swimming a proper stroke.\n\n, You should approach this exercise with patience, as this is a complicated technique that may take some time., He should be about waist or chest deep in the water. Be aware that your child might have eyes that are sensitive to chlorine.\n\n, Practice in the shallow end and allow him to feel how his arms and legs sync up without submerging his head. Regularly, have him turn his head to practice the motion of turning out of the water to breathe. He should alternate the side he turns every third stroke.\n\n, Do this by counting his strokes and having him turn his head and take a deep breath with the third stroke. Alternating sides will keep his form symmetrical., Have him dip his face in the water and practice swimming two strokes, turning his head for a breath on every third stroke. With each breath, he should alternate sides.\n\n, Once he is comfortable, he can graduate to swimming with a life vest and, after mastering that, he can begin supervised swimming on his own.\n\n, When he is experienced enough, you can try this without a life vest. If not, it is fine to start with a life vest on., When he stops moving from the push, he should start kicking and stroking with his arms until he reaches the other side.\n\n\nMake sure you follow closely, especially if he isn't wearing a life vest.\n\n, This will help if your child falls in onto his back., Tell him to drop one of his shoulders towards the bottom of the pool. He should roll the rest of his body to follow the motion of that shoulder.\n\n\nWhen he rotates onto his stomach, have him swim to the side of the pool.\n\n, Treading water is an important skill in case your child needs to stay afloat in the water for a long period of time. It will keep him upright in the water and able to interact with toys and friends while floating., Do this by having him jump off the ladder towards the center of the pool. Once in the water, he should immediately turn around and swim back to the ladder. This basic technique could save your child's life., This will teach him that it is only acceptable to jump to the middle, where it's safest, and not to the sides, where he could get hurt.\n\n, Now that your child is more experienced, he can start learning some real swim strokes. The following are some of the most common swimming strokes your child can learn.\n\n\nFreestyle: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming\n\nBreaststroke: Swim Breaststroke Efficiently\n\nBackstroke: Do Three Basic Strokes while Swimming\n\nSidestroke: Swim the Sidestroke\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":824}

{"text":" Sikhs have an obligation to pray daily, work hard, and share with those in need.;\n, Sikhs are the students of their ten teachers (or Guru's) who compiled their teachings into a unique collection of divine scriptures, called the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\n, The Guru Granth Sahib is considered a Living Guru\n\n,, However outside India attending a Gurdwara might be more difficult, if you live in a large city. If you live near a Gurdwara visit the local Granthi\/Sikh custodian who can provide more information on the Sikh path.\n\n, Some Sikhs are vegetarian because they have a great respect for animals, however Sikhs are not bound to be vegetarianism according to the Sikh Code of Conduct. The Sikh Code of Conduct states that ritually slaughtered meat or Kosher\/Halal is forbidden. When Sikhs attend a Gurdwara only vegetarian food is served. Whether a Sikh is vegetarian can also depend upon what traditions or region he or she are from.\n\n, Akal is only realised through self knowledge, Sikhs therefore place emphasis on meditation to understand Akal. Sikhs aim to become one with Akal in order to end the cycle of birth and death, while not withdrawing from society.\n\n, Sikhs also meditate for the purpose of realizing truth, as Akal (timeless spirit) is truth and truth is Akal and as Sikhs know Akal through meditation so they know truth through meditation, Guru Nanak said truth is only attainable through self realisation. Self realisation thus leads to enlightenment and ends the cycle of birth, death and rebirth.\n\n, Sikhs believe these five distractions prevent one from achieving union with God which is the ultimate goal. If you are to lead a good life free from suffering you must avoid the five distractions.\n\n, He stated that rite, pilgrimages and asceticism and fasting are meaningless, devotion should come inwardly. Sikhs therefore should try to balance work,charity and worship.Sikhs have an optimistic view of life, a spirit of chardi kala. They also believe that they should defend and protect the rights of others. They should never endorse a class system, sexism, racism, or other stereotypes that support inequality\n\n, Charity is very important to Sikhs who balance charity along with work and worship. Charity is part of the Sikh belief in defending others and that can also mean defending others from poverty.\n\n, The part of the Guru Granth Sahib depends on the activity and is supposed to strengthen faith.\n\n, Here are some Sikh festivals taken from Wikipedia, though there are more.\n\n\nGurpurab are celebrations or commemorations based on the lives of the Sikh Gurus. They tend to be either birthdays or celebrations of Sikh martyrdom. All ten Gurus have Gurpurabs on the Nanakshahi calendar, but it is Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh who have a gurpurab that is widely celebrated in Gurdwaras and Sikh homes. The martyrdoms are also known as a shaheedi Gurpurab, which mark the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Tegh Bahadur.\nVaisakhi or Baisakhi normally occurs on 13 April and marks rebirth, the beginning of the new spring year and the end of the harvest. Sikhs celebrate it because on Vaisakhi in 1699, the tenth guru, Gobind Singh, laid down the Foundation of the Khalsa an Independent Sikh Identity.\nBandi Chhor Divas or Diwali celebrates Guru Hargobind's release from the Gwalior Fort, with 52 innocent Hindu kings who were also imprisoned by Jahangir, on 26 October 1619.\nHola Mohalla occurs the day after Holi and is when the Khalsa Panth gather at Anandpur Sahib and display their warrior skills, including fighting and riding.\n\n, Names of the morning and evening prayers are below.\n\n\nMorning prayers include: Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav Prasaad Svaiye, Chaupai Sahib, Anand Sahib\nEvening prayer:Rehras Sahib\nBedtime prayer:Kirtan Sohila\nHere is a link to recordings of prayers: http:\/\/sgpc.net\/live-kirtan-sri-harmandir-sahib-96-kbps\/\n\n\n, When a Sikh takes Amrit he\/she becomes pure or Khalsa.

{"text":" To begin your hydroponic gardening project you will only need a few things to get you off to a great start. Many of the items you need for hydroponics can already be found around your house so you can save money before you go full tilt into this hobby or found all together in a hydroponic garden.;\n, Most newbie gardeners can either purchase an easy to install grow room or build a greenhouse outside of their home. Small grow rooms for the beginning hydroponic gardener are usually slightly larger than a closet and can be completely installed in under an hour. The cost ranges from several hundred dollars to over $500, depending on the add-ons that you think you will need.\n\n, A small greenhouse can cost considerably more because you will need to either include a cement floor and drainage system or lay other types of flooring such as gravel before you build the greenhouse itself. Many small greenhouses cost anywhere from $500 to over several thousand dollars, depending on the add-ons you choose.\n\n\nThe basic items you need after you decide on either a grow room or greenhouse include a temperature control unit, exhaust fan, heating mats, light fixtures for your blue and red spectrum lights, an aeration system (an aquarium system works well for small gardens), pearlite, marble and Styrofoam work well as a beginning medium and rockwool, oasis or Rapid Rooters. Typical beginning tables for your plants include plastic tubs, a child\u2019s swimming pool or fish tank. A gardener can also buy any of the items they need for their grow room from stores specializing in hydroponic supplies.\n\n, Make sure that it can be grown where you live (don't choose a citrus plant if you're living in Alaska, for instance) and that it isn't a plant that is grown underground.\n\n, Fold it over, and place it gently in a clear, sealable bag.\n\n, Germination is triggered when a seed is wet, so keep the paper towels moist. Don't forget that some seeds take longer than others.\n\n, What you do next depends on the type of plant.\n\n\nIf the seed has\u00a0a frailer stem, keep it in the original paper towel but cut small holes for the leaves to emerge through.\nIf the seed has a stronger stem, feel free to cover only the roots in wet paper towels and let the stem straighten out and grow leaves.\n\n, This is a very fragile time in their life, so be extremely gentle.\n\n,, You can choose between having one plant per container, or doing a larger container with many plants. If you choose the second option, make sure that all the plants have good support.\n\n, If you are growing a plant that gets much taller, you should probably tape a support to the side of the container.\n\n, Also, plants need nutrients to grow, so buy a pack of liquid fertilizer to add to the water every week. Follow the package instructions, and don't overfeed the plants.\n\n, They will open and dry up, leaving behind the start of a fruit or vegetable.\n\n\nIf the plant needs cross-pollination in order to be fertilized, place the plant outside or near an open window for a few days so that insects can do the job. A good plant for hydroponic gardening is one that self pollinates.\n\n, Normally, plants can anchor themselves into the dirt for extra support. Check your plant's stem daily for any cracks or bending points.\n\n, Enjoy your hydroponic garden!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":828}

{"text":" Loop the yarn around the pointer and middle fingers of your left hand. Stick your hook through the circle, hooking the working end of your yarn with the hook and then pulling it back through the center of the circle. This will give you one loop on your crochet hook.\n, This will form the very center of the circle you are crocheting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are following a pattern you may need to make a different number of chains to start. This will change the number of stitches you make in further steps but will not change the general technique.\n\n, Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain you made. Once through, hook the working end of the yarn onto the hook and then pull it back through the loop and also through the loop that was on your hook.Now the piece is formed into a circle and you have one loop on your hook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Be sure that you are going through the very center and not one of the stitches you made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, To \"yarn over\" means that you need to hook the working end of your yarn onto your hook. Then twist your hook slightly, so that the yarn stays hooked on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Two loops should be on the hook after you complete this step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This is the finishing step of the basic stitch called a \"Single Crochet\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, In all you will make eight single crochet stitches around forming a tiny circle for the beginning of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This will be the first step in creating a connection between the end of the last round to the beginning of it and setting the stage to start another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Two loops should now be on the hook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This the finishing step of the single crochet stitch which joins everything into a circle. This stitch is also the first single crochet of the next round. (Stitch 1 of 16 total.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Now continue around the circle by making two single crochet stitches in each single crochet stitch of the first ring. Doing this is called an \"increase\". This means that there will be 16 stitches when you complete the round. Please count them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing two stitches in each one stitch from the previous round is how we \"increase\" the size of the circle we are making.\n\n, However, this time you will put only one single crochet in the first stitch but then put two single crochet stitches in the next stitch. Do this \"increase\" in every other stitch of the previous round.Repeat this to the end of the round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Make one single crochet in the first stitch, then make two single crochets in the next stitch. On the next round do two stitches in every third stitch, then two stitches in every fourth stitch and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee a pattern developing? To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on.\n\n, This is called \"Tie-ing off the end\". Once the yarn is tied off, sew or \"weave\" in the ends. Some patterns use the word \"weave\". To sew or weave in the ends, use a Yarn Needle. Fold the yarn end over the Yarn Needle forming a small tight loop. Slide the yarn needle out of the loop, then insert this tight loop into the eye of the Yarn Needle. Push it through far enough that you can grasp the loop and pull the yarn all the way through the eye. Gently weave the needle tip under and over stitches on the back of your work where it will not show. Do this for a distance of 7 to 8 stitches. Now turn around and alternate. Go over the stitches you previously went under and visa-versa. Now turn it around and do it a third time, this will make the \"tail\" or \"yarn-end\" stay put for many years. Remember to sew in both \"tails\" on the outside edge and in the very center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":833}
{"text":" This will affect their balance because they will have to lower themselves to the same height or close to it which takes away the height advantage. Also they will have an inclination to lean forward. This will leave them open to uppercuts and affect their overall balance.;\n, Both parties are likely to be injured and it is not a good way to act, so finding a way not to fight is the best way. Talking is a better way out or making distance or space so it is harder for them to attack you is always better than using your fists.\n\n, You will need to have learned this in a class and have spent a lot of time doing it till you feel and understand that fighting someone bigger, smaller or taller doesn't matter; it is all just fear of being hurt or killed and this is normal.\n\n, Most taller fighters are unable to really \"fight tall\", or truly take advantage of their height. Scan your opponent's face and eyes. Look at their stance (foot position), body language and distance away from you. Is your opponent nervous? Angry? If you move in aggressively does the opponent instinctively shift or move back and keep distance? If not they are probably unaware of how to use their height. You can use this to give yourself a chance to take them by surprise.\n\n, You must motion to the other fighter that you don't want any trouble - even if a fight is imminent. Do this by holding your hands up by your face, palms outward, in a backing away motion - waving your hands slightly. This is the first set up to strike. Tell them you don't want any trouble - and regardless of what they say or do prepare yourself for a fight.\n\n, In any street fight - especially against a larger or taller opponent you must get them first. The old adage \"never swing first\" does not apply. Use the open hand gesture above to launch a surprise first punch either to the throat or nose (never hit the jaw - this can be absorbed by most strong men and can hurt your hands). Speed is essential here. One punch is good but more punches are better. A combination of attacks or quick strikes will do more damage than one single strike, so if you can hit your opponent with more hits, do so. However, do not leave yourself open to a counter attack. Launch your fastest strike possible and immediately step back and return your hands to your face area for protection. While stepping back, circle around your opponent.\n\n, If your opponent is still active you must make sure you keep your hands by your face at all times. This will allow you to use your hands, elbows, and shoulders to deflect punches and strikes from your opponent because they can launch strikes from a distance. Most fighters who are immature or inexperienced will try to hit the head area 90 per cent of the time. Use this to your advantage by keeping the hands up and moving your head and shoulders from side to side and up and down in a bobbing and weaving type motion. Your opponent will fire away at your head out of habit - but will connect on much less of his strikes. You will be harder to hit and confusing to defend when you launch strikes of your own. All the while you are ready to shuffle backwards, in a circle motion, on the feet to create space between you and your opponent while they advance.\n\n, Your opponent will come at you with a combination or attack of some kind and once you avoid it, or block it, you will notice a moment when they pull back for an instant and regroup for another attack. As SOON AS your opponent has thrown the last of their strikes in a particular attack you must immediately step into their personal space - close to them - and attack viciously. You get close-in on them where their reach is negated. Using speed and a close-in attack will force them to retreat or back pedal. Throw with speed and ferocity - NOT PANIC - as many shots to their face and exposed areas as possible. Right before exhaustion you step out of their reach - not just a step back - but two or three steps back and regain your strength and stamina. DO NOT clutch or grab your opponent if they have a significant size or strength advantage. This will only turn out bad for you. This close-in attack approach is THE RULE for fighting taller guys. You can wait for them to finish an attack, as stated above, or you can get them by beating them to the punch when they come in. Either way you must close the gap and get inside of their long reach to do damage.\n\n, This is important to look for because you can use these patterns to hurt your opponent with a counter strike. Let's say your opponent is always throwing a long jab punch and then letting their hands drop down to their waist area before returning their fist to their facial area. You could wait until the timing is right on their next jab and, after you avoid it, throw a power punch right over the top of their outstretched arm (as it begins its drop to their waist) and hit them square in the face. Or if you see a wild, winging power-punch coming from their right hand you could duck it and throw a counter-punch combo of your own. These counter strikes are lethal because they usually combine your power with the momentum of your opponents to hurt them extra bad!\n\n, How do you do this? You simply step at an angle to one side while coming in - so you are facing your opponent, ready to attack - but you are not directly in front of them. You are at an angle - and therefore the usual instinctive indicators that we use to judge a target are slightly less effective here for your opponent. Also you will notice new opportunities to hit areas of weakness in your opponents defense from these angles. Also notice that you should preferably be working angles that position you away from their power. So if your opponent is throwing hard right crosses and hooks, you should be working angles that position you towards their left hand - away from the power.\n\n, You must set up your combos and strikes by throwing out a solid jab. Each jab thrown requires a step forward with the lead foot. Use several jabs in succession with your step footwork in order to close in on your taller opponent and smother their long reach. Get deep into their personal space by setting them up with the jab and drop power shots to their ribs when they bring their defensive guard up to protect the face.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":834}

{"text":" You should know how tags work and of the src and href attributes.;\n, You will find that there are very many properties. However, it is not necessary to learn them all.\n\n\nSome good basic CSS properties to know are color and font-family.\n\n, All properties need a value. For the color property, for example, you might put the red value.\n\n, It is used within an element like href or src. To use it, within the quotation marks after the equal sign, put the CSS attribute, a colon, and then the value of the property. This is known as a CSS rule.\n\n, Inline CSS can add unnecessary clutter to an HTML document. However, it is a great way to get introduced to how CSS works.\n\n, It should allow you to create HTML and CSS files.\n\n\nIf you don't have a special program installed, you can use Notepad or another text editor. Simply save your file both as a text file and a CSS file.\n\n, You should open this with an HTML editor as well, if you have one installed.\n\n\nHTML editors allow you to edit HTML and CSS at the same time.\n\n, This will let you write CSS without the need for a separate file.\n\n, To make your code more legible, always put the second curly brace on its own line.\n\n, Each line must end with a semicolon (;). To make your code legible, each rule should start on its own line and each line should be indented.\n\n\nIt is very important to note that this styling will affect all elements of the selected type on the page. More specific styling will be covered in the next section.\n\n, Open your HTML file as well.\n\n, This will allow you to link a separate CSS file to your HTML document. Your link tag needs three attributes: rel, type, and href.\n\n\n\nrel means \"relationship\" and tells the browser what the relationship is to the HTML document. Here it should have a value of \"stylesheet\".\n\ntype tells what type of media is being linked to. Here it should have a value of \"text\/css\"\n\n\nhref here is used similarly to how it is used in an <a> element, but here it must link to a CSS file. If the CSS file is located in the same folder as the HTML file, only the file name needs to be written within the quotation marks.\n\n, Add a class attribute to these elements and set them equal to a class name of your choice. This will give your elements the same styling.\n\n, Type the class name in your CSS file with a period (.) preceding it (i.e. .class).\n\n, Id's are created in CSS using a pound symbol (#) rather than a period.\n\n\nId's are more specific than classes, so an id will override any class styling if it has an attribute with a different value than the class.\n\n, It is an official website aimed at teaching web development skills.

{"text":" For we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.\" Here Paul lays out that prophesies, tongues and knowledge will end at some point, but when?\nFirst he says, \"We know in part and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.\" So he only mentions two of the three here in this statement. He mentions knowledge and prophesy but not tongues. \"That which is perfect\" that Paul is talking about has to be Heaven, because later he says that then we \"shall see face to face.\" We didn\u2019t see God face to face when the Bible was completed. So this is referring to when we get to Heaven, not the Bible being completed. So what part of what he says applies to tongues? When will tongues \"be stilled\" as he says?;\n, When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.\" Some say that this statement applies to tongues. Yet, Paul did not directly state what in particular is to be put away as child-like.\n\n\nTongues are a gift that strengthens a believer in the early time of their faith for some, this was why most new believers in Acts received tongues as their first spiritual gift, but when we become mature we are to \"put the ways of childhood (the new believer) behind\" us. So some say that Paul is telling them that they will need to outgrow tongues. He says many times in chapter 14 that to prophesy is far better than to speak in tongues because prophecy edifies others and builds up the church more.\nSo what does becoming a man spiritually mean? It means to be able to eat spiritual steak and not just drink milk. When we fully understand more of who God is, Paul is\/may be saying, we won\u2019t need tongues, when we are mature. Tongues are for the new believer, the baby Christian, but as we grow in our walk we should be able to have the gift of teaching or preaching in order to instruct others, etc. Everyone can agree that Paul says \"where there are tongues, they will be stilled and where there is knowledge, it will pass away.\" So when will tongues be stilled and when will knowledge cease? Not in heaven. Not when the Bible was completed. It is still a gift for today. But Paul is saying, it is for the new believer. Tongues is something that encourages people and nurtures their faith, when they are still at the beginning of their faith. But it says that somethings are set aside as we come into maturity as a Christian.\n\n, So is this a good thing? No, for unless it is interpreted, no others can be edified by anything that is said in a tongue? 1 Corinthians 14:11 says, \"If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church.\"\nPaul is saying here that tongues, alone, generally do not build up the church. Yes! The person oneself may be edified, as Paul says, \"Anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God,\" so it could be seen as a good self-edifying time of prayer to God. But people in the church cannot be edified unless the tongue is interpreted. It may make someone feel closer to God when they speak in tongues, but it will not make anyone else feel closer to God unless the tongue is interpreted.\n\n, If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God.\" Why? Because no one else understands what is being said in the tongue. Therefore, it cannot and does not edify any other person unless it is interpreted.\nAlso note that he says only two or \"at the most three\" people are to speak in a tongue in public worship. In 1 Corinthians 13:1 Paul says, \"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.\" So, it doesn\u2019t matter, if someone is able to speak in the tongues of angels, but does so without love for others. If they do not respect others in using their gift of tongues, Paul says that they become only \"a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.\"\nNeither of those are a good or necessary thing. If a cymbal is used in an orchestra in time and rhythm, it sounds good. But if it is randomly clanged for no reason at all, that is not good. That is the picture Paul is trying to paint. What purpose does random tongues speaking serve? Tongues does not serve a purpose in the church unless it is in rhythm and order with the service. Paul is saying it becomes a distraction, if it is not done in love, if it is random.\nSo how can the gift of tongues be done in love in the church -- only when the tongues are quickly interpreted so that everyone can know what is being said. Amen. Paul says, \"Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.\" To speak in tongues without an interpreter does not promote fellowship but rather it can isolate people.\n\n, He confused their languages so that they could NOT have fellowship with each other. He caused them all to speak a different language so that they would not be united enough to build the tower that they were trying to build.\nSo for everyone to be speaking in a different language divides people. It does not promote unity. Overall, does the gift of tongues in public worship unite the church or dis-unify the church? Paul is saying that it can dis-unify the church. Why? Because if no one knows what you are saying, how can you have fellowship with them? Paul says in 1 Corinthians 14:16, \"When you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else\u2026say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying -- Yes! -- as that is the problem with uninterpreted tongues.\nTo practice the gift of tongues in public worship changes the time of gathering together from a community meeting and time of fellowship to a singular event that is between you and God. No one else understands what the speaker is saying, unless it is interpreted, so what is the point? In community worship, speaking in tongues is pointless unless it is interpreted. That is why Paul says tongues need to be interpreted, if they are used in the church.\nPaul says, \"Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.\" Is it good to edify yourself -- Yes! -- but, when Christians gather together the focus needs to be on edifying the other Christians, not on yourself. We need to think of how we can bless the other people, not just how we can build ourselves up.\n\n, Why did he do that? Paul did that for a reason. At the end of chapter 12 Paul says, \"Now eagerly desire the greater gifts. And yet I will show you the most excellent way.\" So what is the more excellent way? Love.\nPaul is saying spiritual gifts are great, but love is better. If someone has every single spiritual gift on the list, but doesn\u2019t have love, then he\/she has nothing. Love should be the highest goal for the Christian, not spiritual gifts.\nOften times spiritual gifts can actually even become an idol. People start to worship the spiritual gift rather than God. That might happen in some churches regarding the gift of tongues.\n\n, It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. \" Think of this passage in the context of tongues.\nAre tongues patient? Not generally in how they are practiced. To be patient would be to talk in turn, not everyone speaking at once.\nAre tongues kind? If someone degrades someone else or says that they are not Christian because they don't have the gift of tongues no, that is definitely not kind or loving to other believers!\nDo tongues cause envy? Usually the reason why people speak in tongues in church is to show how \"spiritual\" they are. In essence, they want other people in the church to acknowledge them because of their gift of tongues.\nDo tongues lead to boasting -- Yes! -- if it becomes like a super power that the Christian who has it brags about to the ones who don\u2019t have it. This is not loving and being in fellowship with other believers.\nDo tongues make some people proud -- Yes!, but why -- because it really is a great privilege to instantly know another language without having to learn it or study it for years. It takes most people 3 years to learn a new language, on average, but with the gift of tongues, you can bypass all that effort. But is this spiritual gift given to make ourselves more prideful or to boost our ego? No. Of course not. That is never why spiritual gifts are given. They are given to us so that mature Christians can edify one another. Period.\n\n,\n\n\nDo tongues build up others or do they sometimes dishonor others? Anytime that you are leaving other people out for any reason, that dishonors them. Are tongues self-seeking? Often times yes. If people are doing it to appear more spiritual, that is self-seeking. If they do it to get the praises of man, that is self-seeking, yes. Are some tongues speakers easily angered? If you tell them their tongue has to be interpreted or they must remain silent in any public setting, yes that can anger people with the gift of tongues. But these are the rules Paul lays out that we are all supposed to follow. These are not just man made rules that tongues must be interpreted.\n\n, So Paul is saying essentially, \"This is not just me writing this. These are not just my opinions. These are 'the commandments of the Lord.' \" As in everything he just said about gifts of the Holy Spirit including tongues is on the same level as the 10 Commandments. So they need to be taken very literally and very seriously.\n\n, How does that relate to spiritual gifts or tongues? Well, evil would be any kind of dissension in the body of Christ. Disagreeing on the gifts of the Holy Spirit can cause dissension. So, that is not good. Also, some have said that they have heard tongues that were demonically inspired rather than God inspired. We would hope that people could discern the difference, but it is not always possible, such as when the fruit of speaker is not yet known by the hearers.\nRegardless of whether someone can speak in tongues or not, if the tongue is from Satan, we should not delight in it at all, obviously. There are counterfeit tongues. Satan can give people a counterfeit gift of tongues. In many other religions around the world people are also able to speak in tongues. Their gift of tongues is not from God though, but from Satan.\nTongues would always need to be interpreted, so that we can know for sure whether what is being said is from God or not -- as in to make sure it's not from Satan.\n\n, In regard to tongues, we need to protect others from possibly getting a demonically inspired gift of tongues. To push people to speak in tongues might lead them without knowing it to demonic tongues.\nIf the Holy Spirit wants to give someone the gift of tongues, He will. We don\u2019t need to force it at all. It will be an easy thing to do, if God really wants you to do it. But to force it can actually cause Satan to give you a counterfeit gift.\nTo desire tongues more than we desire following Christ is totally out of line. The Spirit of God will say, \"Jesus Christ is Lord of all.\" Yes? (1 Corinthians 12:3). So, we need to be careful. That is \"whatever you are doing, do it as unto The Lord,\" as you are guided by the Bible and the Holy Spirit. If you have the mind of Christ then agreeing together is important, not doubting. Expressing disagreement with the clear Word of God in the Bible is dissension. You must follow Jesus, not the gifts or words of a man or woman who is not speaking the Gospel with Love.\nPaul says, \"Love always trusts.\" Then you will trust that a true servant of the Lord is saying good things to you or about you, even if you can\u2019t hear it or understand what he\/she is saying, yes? So, if someone prays for someone in a tongue, how can the other person know and trust that what is being said is good? One cannot for sure know that what is being said is good, by the unknown words that are spoken. So you will know them by their fruits, and then your trust is placed in the Lord, not in the flesh.\nYou trust by Love, and then do not cause dissension. Trust the Lord's servant as you trust the Lord. Who is a true servant of the Lord? A servant must be consistently proclaiming The Truth including: Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, came as God in the flesh, died and was raised again to life as Lord and Savior of all. And we must repent and be born again by receiving Salvation \"in His name by grace, through faith not of oneself, not of works, it is the gift of God,... saved unto good works that God foreordained that we should do them\" (Ephesians 2:8--10). And we actively love, speak well of, and forgive one another, and we take communion in remembrance of Jesus Christ, and we baptize believers; and say that Jesus is now living forever, always making intercession for us and is our soon coming King. As long as that person is agreeing with and speaking that kind of Gospel, under authority of God's word in the Bible presented accurately, then Trust the servant of the Gospel as unto the Lord.\n\n, It might be exciting for some. It can be used to witness to people we would not have otherwise been able to witness to. It can draw someone closer to God. But any public setting, the worshipers and service need to be controlled and moderated by a pastor or other minister. We need to always, always exercise the gift with self-control.\nIn 1 Corinthians 14:32 Paul says, \"The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.\" This means we should be able to control any spiritual gift that we have. A spiritual gift should never cause us to be out of control, out of order -- or to go against the Bible.\nPaul goes on to say, \"For God is not the author of confusion but of peace.\" Amen! Other translations say, \"God is a God of order, not disorder.\" So, anything that causes disorder or confusion is not from God, or for sure God does not approve of it. Always remember to seek agreement, to be in one accord.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":838}

Filing fraudulent disputes can lead to your account being disabled.\n\n, If you've received a copyright strike on your video, it's because the original creator or owner has decided that your video does not fall under \"fair use.\" Fair use allows you to use content that others have created, but only in specific circumstances that are decided on a case-by-case basis. Fair use is a fairly complicated topic, but generally your video will be measured against the following four factors (in the US):The purpose of using the copyrighted content. The video needs to add new expression or meaning to the original copyrighted content. Non-profit and educational uses are given more leeway, but are not exempt. If your video is monetized, your chances of claiming fair use diminish.\nThe nature of the copyrighted content. Using factual copyrighted content (e.g. news reports) is usually considered more fair than fictional content (e.g. movies).\nThe ratio of copyrighted content to your own content. You'll have a better chance of claiming fair use if you only use a few bits and pieces of the copyrighted content, and the vast majority of the video is your own work.\nHarm done to the potential profits of the copyright holder. If your video can be perceived to cause a negative impact on the owner's profits, you are less likely to be eligible for fair use. Parody is the main exception to this.\n\n, A copyright strike will stay in effect for six months on your account.

It's very relaxing, and might be the best night of sleep you'll get all summer.\n\n, Crack a window open if you can, and wake up to the sounds of the morning; people mowing the lawn, your mom making breakfast downstairs, etc. If you're not tired, go on a late night walk or jog. Usually the sprinklers are on at this time and its just a lot of fun to see your neighborhood in the middle of the night.\n\n, This will help you keep up on your writing skills for school, too. Write down words that you like, poems, song lyrics, what happened during basketball practice, anything you want! Keep it under your mattress if you want to keep it private; this only works if you step up and change your own sheets. And most importantly, write in it everyday; maybe wait to look at the previous pages until the very end of summer, when it should be all full.\n\n, It will help you get in shape and you will enjoy being in nature.\n\n, It's something to do, you meet new people, and you will have a great body when school starts again!\n\n, This is entertaining and will help you do better in school come fall with the new vocabulary you have learned. Focus on your brain; something useful to make you smarter and more interesting to others.\n\n, It's a great way to get rid of junk or things that you don't use anymore! Plus you can make a good amount of money through this. You can also ask your parents to create an eBay account so you can buy and sell items on eBay.\n\n, That is a way to catch up with your schoolwork, learn a new hobby, or prepare for future education. In this generation, you don't have to be \"college age\" to go to college; you can get college degrees online at the age of 14. If you can't find any online classes, try taking community ed classes at your local library.\n\n, Enjoy it; the rest of the year you are involved in school.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":841}

{"text":" You'll need to overcome a few factors on your way to becoming a train operator, but the biggest obstacle in your path is a union agreement made in 2008.According to this agreement, the TfL is not allowed to advertise externally and, instead, hires mostly from within the organization.Other positions with the TfL, like Customer Service Assistant, are open to the general public. The application process varies according to position, so you should research your options on the TfL website.\nApprenticed youth (ages 16 - 18) may also be accepted into training as a train operator for the TfL.More information can be found in the \"Getting an Apprenticeship\" portion of this article.;\n, This might require some research on your part, as not all jobs with the TfL may be suitable for you and your goals. Once you gain a job with the TfL, you will be able to apply as a train operator.\n\n\nSome researchers have found that it is an effective strategy to first get a job with the TfL as a Customer Service Assistant and then apply for train operator when the position becomes available., Due to the cyclic nature of the hiring process, you may have to wait some time before the TfL begins hiring for the position you desire. If you apply for your position and are not contacted to continue the hiring process, don't give up hope! You should:\n\n\nResearch desired traits of the position you apply for.\nTake related certification and safety courses.\nVolunteer in positions similar to the one you are pursuing to show your competence.\n\n, The approximate number of new train operators, per year, is about 150.This means there will likely be considerable competition for the position. For you to stand the best chance possible, you'll need to take the application process seriously.\n\n, This is a trait that is especially important while applying to be a train operator. After the application process, which can take a considerable time itself, training to be a train operator can take up to six months before you are ready to do the job on your own., The temptation of a great salary, higher than average vacation days, privacy, and a shorter than average work week can make it easy to gloss over the difficult points of this position. As a train operator, you'll need to be able to bear:\n\n\nLong stretches of time on your own.\nExtreme hot and cold conditions.\nSmall, dark spaces.\nRepetitive, accuracy dependent work., Once it is finished, you can send it to the address listed on the form or, if directed by your superior to do so, return the form to him or the colleague he indicates.\n\n\nThe length of time it takes for the TfL to process the initial application response can be quite long., This test is timed for 30 minutes and is intended to evaluate your potential ability as a train operator.Prior to your test, you should look over any provided materials. The TfL gives sample questions for the purpose of preparing for this test.\nAs the TfL is constantly improving its training procedures, there may be additional assessments required of you at the time of your test.\n\n, These sections serve to measure:\n\n\nPsychological stability\nOn-the-job aptitude\nPersonality evaluation, The English portion of the assessment centre test is aimed at determining how skillfully receive and express information in written word. Spelling, clarity, and accuracy should be made a priority during this portion of the test., As an operator of a train in the London underground, you'll have to use the Public Address (PA) system on your train to communicate with its passengers. Due to the fact that many PA systems are less than adequate, clear speaking is particularly important. You will be tested on your PA skills by:\n\n\nReceiving practice information to relay to passengers.\nWriting out your announcement as you intend on making it.\nRecording it into an audio tape., Levers, pulleys, and ramps might not seem like something you need to review, but the assessment centre test will also evaluate your mechanical comprehension. This will involve you looking at mechanical diagrams and then predicting the result of the mechanism in question. The second part of the mechanical portion of the test will require you to evaluate systems that affect each other.You will have to find all errors in these that might cause the system to breakdown.\n\n, The final leg of your assessment centre testing will likely involve two computer tests intended to gauge your abilities of concentration and reflex. The concentration activity involves picking out specified groupings of dots within a time limit, and the reflex test utilizes external prompts, like lights and sounds, which you will respond to with a special keyboard.To improve these two areas, you may want to:\n\n\nRun through woodlands\nPlay dodgeball\nPlay reaction based video games\nPlay puzzle\/response based games, This is the final step assessing your competence as a potential train operator for the London underground. During this test, TfL staff will ask you questions pertaining to the job and you will be expected to answer to the best of your ability. These questions may also include inquiry about:\n\n\nWhy you want to be a train operator.\nHow you would respond in a certain situation.\nLine\/depot suitability., The training process for becoming a train operator for the tube can take anywhere from 6 - 12 months depending on individual factors.Once your training is complete, you will begin working on your own as a train operator. Generally, over the course of your training, you will:\n\n\nReceive an introduction to general information about the London underground.\nFamiliarize yourself with Operational Procedures Training.\nTour the depot and examine roster\/duty sheet information.\nLearn about basic train knowledge., Though union agreements make it all but impossible for a non-union member to get a job as a train operator for the tube, a loophole in the agreements does allow for apprenticeships.The general requirements to become an apprentice include:\n\n\nBeing between 16 and 18 years of age.\nHaving no less than four GCSEs\nPhysical ability, Though well salaried and seemingly straightforward, the job of a train operator has many difficult points as well. If you are uncomfortable in confined spaces for long periods of time, dislike the dark or early\/late shifts, are sensitive to extreme weather conditions, or find concentrating on repetitive tasks difficult, a job as a train operator for the tube might not be for you., The hiring process usually follows a predictable pattern, which enables organizations like TfL to schedule application submissions. The next open enrollment for apprenticeships begins January 7, 2016.For more information or to read the 2016 apprenticeship brochure, visit:\n\n\nhttps:\/\/tfl.gov.uk\/corporate\/careers\/apprenticeships\n\n, Once you have been accepted into the apprenticeship program, you'll be allowed to continue in the evaluation portion of the assessment process.This may be similar to the assessments given to regular workers of TfL who are applying to become a train operator, and may include:\n\n\nMultiple choice tests\nEnglish testing\nEnunciation testing\nMechanical knowledge testing\nConcentration tests\nReflex response tests","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":843}
{"text":" Allergens are substances that can cause allergic reactions. Airborne allergens are allergens that travel through the air, such as dust, animal fur, pollen from trees, and grass. You should look for any possible sources of airborne allergens in your home. This could be dusty floors or windowsills, fur from the family pet, and pollen from indoor plants or flowers.You should also note irritants like cigarette smoke and air pollution. Check your household cleaning products for any irritating chemicals and fragrances. These airborne irritants can trigger asthma attacks.\nThere are also other allergens, such as cockroaches and mold, that should be noted and removed. These allergens can trigger asthma attacks in your child if they are not addressed and eliminated.;\n, Asthma can be triggered by exercise and physical activities as these put stress on your child\u2019s respiratory system. While it is important that your child get enough physical exercise to stay healthy, you should also monitor her exercise to ensure it is not irritating her asthma.Studies suggest that doing physical activity can actually reduce the frequency of your child\u2019s asthma attacks in the long term. But it is important to find a balance. You want your child to do enough physical activity to stay healthy without triggering her asthma.\n\n, The chemicals used to preserve foods can trigger asthma. Sulfites are one of the most common preservatives, often found in a number of foods and drinks. Read food labels to ensure they do not contain preservatives that will trigger an asthma attack in your child.\n\n, Respiratory infections, such as a bad cold or a viral infection in the lungs, can lead to asthma attacks. If you suspect your child might have other health conditions that are putting her at a greater risk of an asthma attack, you should bring her to the doctor for a check up. The doctor can examine her and determine if she requires medication to treat the infection.Other health conditions like heartburn and sleep apnea can also trigger asthma. Heartburn is also known as acid reflux and can develop due to a poor diet or digestive issues. Sleep apnea is a condition where the person has shallow or interrupted breathing while sleeping, often due to enlarged tonsils or adenoids, which can disrupt your sleep and also trigger breathing conditions like asthma., Asthma attacks can be triggered by some medications such as aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers.Beta-blockers are often prescribed for heart issues. Your doctor should avoid prescribing NSAIDs or beta-blockers for your child as they have shown to trigger asthma attacks and other health issues for individuals with asthma.However, do not stop administering your child's medications without talking to your child's doctor first.\nYou should also avoid giving your child aspirin as it can trigger asthma attacks.\n\n, Emotional stress can act as a trigger for asthma. You should check in periodically with your child to ensure she is not experiencing any stress from school or trauma at home. You should also monitor your child\u2019s behavior and note any signs of stress or trauma., Smoke from cigarettes and cigars can be a major asthma trigger for your child. Set a no smoking rule in your home. If you live in a housing complex or an apartment building that is not smoke-free, work with your neighbors and your landlord to advocate for a smoke-free environment in the building.You can also use the policy brief supplied by the American Lung Association to help create a smoke free environment in the entire building or complex., Using natural fibers in your home can greatly reduce asthma triggers as dust and allergens are less likely to get trapped in natural fibers.You should wash all bedding, towels, rugs, and curtains at least once a week in hot water and dry them on high heat to remove any allergens.\nYou should also avoid using down-filled pillows and comforters as they can carry allergens. Put a mattress cover on your child\u2019s mattress to prevent allergens from burrowing in her mattress. You should also use pillow covers on your child\u2019s pillows to protect her from allergens in her pillows.\n\n, Switching to all-natural cleaning products will help to reduce the number of chemical allergens in your home. Go for unscented products as they are usually less irritating.You should also try to keep your house clean and dust free. Use a damp cloth to get rid of dust on all flat surfaces in your home. Vacuum once a week with a vacuum that has a HEPA filter to really make sure there is no dust lying around in your home. This will greatly reduce your child\u2019s risk of an asthma attack., Mold can be a major asthma trigger for your child. You should take steps to keep your home well-ventilated and dry as this will reduce the development of mold.Set up a dehumidifier in any spots that prone to dampness in your home, such as the bathroom or the basement.\nIf you cannot keep certain areas well ventilated, you should use an ozonator or a 100 W bulb on the area at all times to keep the area warm and dry. This will prevent mold from developing.\nCheck shower curtains, the back of doors, and walls for any mold. Remove the mold by using a solution of one part chlorine bleach and nine parts water (1 cup bleach combined with nine cups water).\nYou should also check your houseplants periodically to ensure there is no mold developing in the soil. If there is mold, replace the soil or repot the plant.\n\n, Carpeting is a big carrier of chemicals, dust, mold, and dander from pets. If possible, replace your carpet with tile flooring and natural fiber rugs. Natural fiber rugs are easier to keep clean than carpeting.If you cannot afford to pull out carpet and replace it, make an effort to keep the carpet clean. Use a steam cleaner on the carpets at least twice a month and vacuum the carpet with a good vacuum on a daily basis so allergens do not build up in the carpet.\n\n, Pests like cockroaches can carry allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. You should make sure your home is cockroach-free. This may mean getting your home professionally treated for roaches through a pest removal service.You should specify that there individuals with asthma in your home and ensure the service is familiar with exterminating pests in asthma-prone homes. The service should not use aerosol sprays or any other chemicals that could trigger asthma attacks.\n\n, These materials can collect dust and other allergens that can trigger asthma attacks. Try not to let paper materials sit in your home for long periods of time. Set up a recycling bin outside for paper materials or in an area where your child does not spend a lot of time., One way to do this is to check local reports about pollen and ozone counts. Pollen counts tend to be the highest between five and ten am, depending on where you are located. You may want to keep your child indoors during these times and check local air quality before you let your child go outside to ensure it is not too polluted.If you are not sure which allergens are causing your child\u2019s asthma, you may ask your child\u2019s doctor to skin-test her for common triggers. These could include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, and air pollution. You could then limit your child\u2019s exposure to their allergens to reduce her risk of an asthma attack.\nSince one common trigger for asthma is an upper respiratory infection like the flu, get your child vaccinated for the flu every year. (Adults with asthma should be vaccinated against the flu as well.)\n\n, Asthma can be triggered by food allergies and food sensitivities. You should remove these foods from your child\u2019s diet so she is not triggered.You can also determine which foods are acting as triggers by keeping a food diary. Note the foods your child eats during the day and any reactions she has to the food. If the reaction is negative or asthma inducing, you should eliminate that food from her diet.\nYour doctor can order blood tests for food allergies if it is unclear which foods are causing the problem.\n\n, If your child is triggered by animal dander and animal fur, you should let her interact with only pets and animals that are hypoallergenic. This may mean replacing the family pet with a hypoallergenic pet or only allowing your child to play with friends\u2019 pets that are hypoallergenic., Your child should get into the habit of carrying her asthma inhaler with her at all times, especially when she will be exercising. Her inhaler may be necessary when she is doing exercise, such as playing a sport or going for a run.You should not totally limit your child\u2019s exercise as she needs to stay healthy. But you should make sure she has her inhaler in case of any issues and does not push herself too hard when doing exercise, as this could lead to an asthma attack.\n\n, If you haven\u2019t already, you should start a daily diary that records your child\u2019s asthma symptoms. You should also note any possible triggers, from environmental to emotional. Update the dairy if you notice any other triggers as this will allow you to stay on top of your child\u2019s asthma triggers and reduce her risk of an attack., An Asthma Action Plan can be developed with your doctor and is a good way to develop a plan of action in the event of an asthma attack. An Asthma Action Plan can also help you to track your child\u2019s asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them so your child does not have an asthma attack.The Asthma Action Plan will be broken down into three zones: the Green Zone, the Yellow Zone, and the Red Zone. These zones will help keep track of the severity of your child's asthma. The Green Zone is the normal, safe zone, where there are no issues with your child's breathing. The Yellow Zone is the warning zone, where your child is experiencing some asthma symptoms but is not yet experiencing a full on asthma attack. The Red Zone is the severe zone, where your child is having an asthma attack. If you cannot get your child's asthma under control using an inhaler or other techniques, you may need to take her to emergency care.\nYou should give everyone in your family a copy of the Asthma Action Plan so everyone around your child is aware of the steps they can take to prevent your child from having an asthma attack.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":844}

{"text":",, We are interested to know the angle x formed where the the two side c's meet. Thinking about it, the original triangle was made of 180 degrees with the angle on the right at the far end of b, called theta, and the other angle at the top of a, being 90 degrees minus theta, as all the angles total 180 degrees and we already have one 90 degree angle.\n\n, At the bottom, we have\u00a0 theta, at the top left we have 90 degrees, and the top right we have 90 degrees minus theta.\n\n\nThe mystery angle x is 180 degrees. So theta + 90 degrees-theta + x = 180 degrees. Adding theta and negative theta gives us zero on the left, and subtracting 90 degrees from both sides leaves x equal to 90 degrees. So we have established that the mystery angle x = 90 degrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, First, the formula for a trapezoid is A= the Height x (Base1 + Base 2)\/2. The height is a+b and (Base1 + Base 2)\/2 = 1\/2(a + b). So that all equals 1\/2 (a+b)^2.\n\n, We have the two smaller triangles at bottom and left, and those together equal 2*1\/2(a*b), which just equals (a*b). Then we also have 1\/2 c*c, or 1\/2 c^2. So together we have the other formula for the area of the trapezoid equaling (a*b)+ 1\/2 c^2.\n\n, 1\/2(a+b)^2=(a*b)+1\/2 c^2. Now multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the 1\/2's\n2(1\/2 (a+b)^2) = 2((a*b)+ 1\/2 c^2.) which simplifies as (a+b)^2 = 2ab + c^2.\n\n, to obtain a^2 + b^2 = c^2, The Pythagorean Theorem!\n\n,,\nFor more art charts and graphs, you might also want to click on Category:Microsoft Excel Imagery, Category:Mathematics, Category:Spreadsheets or Category:Graphics to view many Excel worksheets and charts where Trigonometry, Geometry and Calculus have been turned into Art, or simply click on the category as appears in the upper right white portion of this page, or at the bottom left of the page.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":847}
{"text":" For best results, finish other installations and building projects before you install the floor to avoid damaging it. Bamboo planks may expand or warp if exposed to excessive moisture, so this is especially important for \"wet\" work involving cement or plaster., Move furniture out now while you still have the old floor to walk across. You will need to store this furniture elsewhere for at least 24 hours. If you are pouring a new concrete subfloor, which is not necessary for a typical floor installation, you may need to wait 60 days before you can put the floor in place and return the furniture.\n\n, Remove any carpeting or rugs in the room, and detach the baseboard around the floor if present. If you have old flooring in place, remove it to expose the wooden or concrete subfloor underneath. Be aware that vinyl or asphalt flooring may contain asbestos, and if it crumbles at the touch, you should remove it with protective equipment and procedures to protect your health and safety.\n\n\nSee also How to Remove Linoleum and How to Remove Floor Tile.\nIf you are careful while removing the baseboard, it may be possible to install it again after the new floor is in.\n\n, If the result is above 12% in a wooden subfloor or 75% in a concrete subfloor, the subfloor is not suitable for bamboo flooring.Consider installing a more moisture-tolerant floor material instead. Moisture tolerances for flooring material should be listed by the manufacture.\n\n\nNew concrete subfloors should be left to dry and cure for 60 days after they were poured. You may not get\n\n, If the subfloor and surrounding areas are not dry year round, the moisture could eventually cause decay in the bamboo or in the adhesive attaching it. If there is a large amount of mold present, or if you suspect the ductwork is faulty, consider hiring a professional.If there are crawlspaces beneath your house with exposed earth, you could reduce moisture by covering the earth with a vapor barrier such as 6 mil (0.15mm) polyethylene sheets., Vacuum or sweep your subfloor so it is clear of dust. If you are installing your bamboo floor with an adhesive, cleaning stains and spills off the subfloor is recommended so the adhesive sticks properly. Sand down paint or other coatings in this scenario as well, then vacuum up the dust it creates.\n\n, Use a long level, or a level attached to a long string, to measure the floor in several directions and places. If any reading reveals a height difference greater than 3\/16\" over 10 ft. (approximately 5mm over 3m), you may have to alter the subfloor to make sure the bamboo flooring doesn't squeak or bend.Wooden subfloors can have high spots sanded down, but low spots should be cut out and replaced.Concrete subfloors can be leveled using a rented concrete sander to sand down high spots, and using a concrete repair mix to build up low spots., Use a tape measure to measure the dimensions of the floor and calculate the square footage (or square meterage) you will need. This measurement will be used to determine the amount of bamboo flooring you need to purchase.\n\n, Once the room is free of dust created by the cleaning and preparation process, close the doors and windows so the room can reach a consistent temperature.Once the room temperature is stable after a day or two, it is time to purchase the bamboo.\n\n\nThe ideal temperature for bamboo flooring is between 60 and 70\u00baF (16\u201321\u00baC), while the ideal humidity is between 40 and 60%. These measurements don't have to be perfect, but if the typical conditions in your room vary greatly from these numbers, bamboo flooring is not recommended.\n\n, If the flooring is sold by number of planks, you'll have to calculate how many you need by dividing the total room area by the area of one plank. It's a good idea to purchase 5% more flooring by area than you think you need, since you may need to cut some of the planks to fit your space.\n\n\nBe aware of additional difficulties with concrete subfloors (see Nailing Down the Floor). The bamboo flooring salesman should be able to advise you on solutions that match your specific situation.\n\n, Bring the planks inside and remove the wrapping. Wait for at least one day, and up to three, for the bamboo planks to adjust to the room's temperature. They may expand or shrink slightly as they do so, and the floor will fit better if you let the planks do this before you install them, rather than after.\n\n\nAvoid storing the planks directly on concrete or against outside walls, as this may affect their moisture content or temperature. Consider bringing a table inside and placing the planks on top of it.\n\n, You cannot nail a floor onto concrete, so if you have a concrete subfloor, you may need to install a wooden underlay first. A more stable solution, though more expensive, may be to purchase floating floor materials. This includes a layer of foam or other material as an underlay, then click-together floorboards that do not require nails.\n\n, If there is a room below the floor you are installing, remove chandeliers, ceiling fans, and other fixtures while you are installing. The pressure of the pneumatic nail gun could shake them loose through the floor joists.\n\n, Leave a 1\/2 inch (1.27 cm) space between the bamboo floorboards and the wall to allow for any slight expansion of the floorboards. Place them across the floor joists, and start against an outside wall if possible to establish your line.Fit each plank together using the tongues and grooves.\n\n\nUsing spacers is recommended. These are simply thin or wedge-shaped objects placed between the floor and the wall to keep them separate.\n\n, Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the last floorboard to the correct length. Save the excess board to begin the next row.\n\n, Drilling the holes before nailing reduces the chance of bending or breaking the board. Drill at a 45\u201350\u00ba angle from the side of the board, so the next row of planks will hide the nails. Make sure the holes you drill are smaller than the nails you are using.\n\n\nEach board should be drilled (and nailed) approximately every 10 inches (25 cm), and about 4 inches (10cm) from each end. Do not drill closer than 4 inches (10cm) from the end to avoid splitting the board.If your subfloor has raised floor joists, make sure your hole is over one of these so the board can be securely nailed.\n\n, Test on a piece of scrap or defective bamboo floorboard first to see if the gun and nails are appropriate for your wood. If it \"dimples\" with a raised or cracked mark, test again with a different air pressure.\n\n\nWarning: put on safety goggles before using a nail gun.\n\n, Nail the boards in place through the guide holes you drilled. A professional quality nail gun will minimize the chance of breaking your floorboards. The use of 18 gauge nails is recommended for securing bamboo floorboards., The second row should be nailed in the same method as the first, drilling then nailing from the side to fasten it to the floor joists.\n\n\nUse a rubber mallet to tap the row into place before nailing.\n\n, Offset the floorboards by two to three times the width of the floorboards as you lay them for a uniform look. Work from several cartons of bamboo flooring at once, if you have more than one, so that color variations are evenly spread across the room, instead of clumped together., Once the first two rows are laid down securely, you can fasten the other floorboards using only the tongues of the board. Drill a hole directly above the tongue of the board, at a 45\u00ba angle into the wood. Keep a careful eye on the nail penetration and adjust air pressure if necessary so the nail head only penetrated just deeply enough for the groove of the next board to fit over it.Tap boards together with a rubber mallet before nailing, as before.\n\n, Use a table saw or circular saw to cut the floorboards to the correct shape to fit the room. If there is a gap you need to fill that is less than half the width of a floorboard, pick up two or more floorboards and saw them to half their width or more so that, in total, they fit the space more closely. Sawing a single floorboard to less than half its width is likely to cause breaks when nailing.\n\n, Secure the last two rows with additional nails to ensure the floor is well fastened. Once these are in place, you may use the floor immediately.\n\n\nRemember to leave a 1\/2 inch (1.25cm) gap between each wall to allow for expansion. This can be hidden by replacing the baseboard molding, and by applying additional shoe molding if necessary\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":848}
{"text":"\n\n\nAs you go throughout the process of learning your Eskimo roll technique, make sure that you maintain a firm grip on your paddle.;\n, You want to lead your paddle into the water on the right, or starboard, side of your boat.\n\n\nAfter you form this arch, you want to follow through with your paddle in the water all the way back to the stern, along the starboard side of your boat.\nA higher arch with the paddle will give you more power in your Eskimo roll.\nHowever, form takes practice. You\u2019ll want to have maximum power without compromising your ability to pull the paddle against the resistance of the water. This is a personal balance, and it will depend on your upper body strength.\n\n,\n\n\nMake sure that you have a friend or instructor near by to watch and provide feedback on your technique. You don\u2019t want to form any bad technical habits.\nA large part of the success of an Eskimo roll lies in the fluidity of your motions. You want to be able to go through the motions of s roll without stopping to think about each position or step.\nPractice for a few hours over the course of a few days before you attempt to roll under water.\n\n, The first time you do this, you\u2019re going to exit the kayak rather than roll. To make yourself comfortable, ease into flipping over completely.\n\n\nHave your friend bring the bow of their boat next to your cockpit, perpendicular to your boat.\nReach out one hand to rest on their bow.\nSlowly lean toward your friend, and tip your boat into the water about 45 degrees. Then, return to an upright position by pushing down on their bow.\nRepeat this a few times. Each time, slightly increase how far you lean into the water.\nDo this until you can lean far enough to flip yourself over completely.\n\n, This will give you a safety net as you begin to practice your rolls. You\u2019ll know you are never trapped underwater, as you can always perform a boat exit.\n\n\nPractice with the spray skirt on your kayak. You will need a spray skirt when you roll.\nMake sure that your spray skirt\u2019s handle is within your reach, and that you are in a snug seated position in your kayak.\nAfter you capsize your kayak, take a second or two to orient your self, and remain as calm as possible.\nGrab your spray skirt by the handle, and pull it off.\nPlace the paddle between your hands, firmly grip the edge of the cockpit, and push yourself out to either side of your kayak. Keep your head as close to the surface as you can.\n\n,\n\n\nEach time you perform your exit, try to stay under water for a little longer.\nYou want to have as much control over your breath as you can.\n\n, Because you are new to Eskimo rolls, you may not be able to flip yourself back over completely on your first few tries.Remember, if you need help at any point, bang your hands against the side of your boat, or stick your hand up out of the water.\nMake sure your friend is on high alert.\n\n, Once you capsize, your arm technique and paddle arch motion will be exactly the same as it was when you practiced on the surface of the water. It will simply be inverted.\n\n\nIf you can\u2019t pull yourself up on the first try, you complete the motion twice to practice under water, depending on how long you can hold your breath.\nDon\u2019t be alarmed if you surface for a second and are pulled back underwater. You will need to exert a large amount of force to right yourself complete, and this takes trial and error.\n\n, The only way to learn to do an Eskimo is to continue to practice. Don\u2019t become discouraged and quit if you can\u2019t get it right away. Eventually, the action will become natural and fluid.\n\n\nExperiment with different amounts of force and the height of your paddle.\nDon\u2019t try to roll in a setting such as the ocean or a river until you are extremely comfortable with the action and have completed it many times.\n\n,\n\n\nWhite water or ocean water can be too rough and unpredictable for those learning to do an Eskimo roll for the first time.\nIf you are in a lake, avoid areas with submerged limbs or shallow areas with large rocks. You don\u2019t want to hit your head as you roll.\n\n, When you are learning new techniques, it\u2019s best to kayak in places that you\u2019ve been before. If you choose to kayak on a lake, try to pick a place where you know the landscape and are comfortable.\n\n\nYou want to choose a familiar space so you are aware of all possible variables and dangers as you begin your Eskimo roll.\n\n, Anytime you\u2019re out on the water, you want to make sure you have a friend there for safety, especially when you are learning new techniques.\n\n\nIf you can, recruit someone to help you who has kayaking experience and knows how to roll. They can watch your technique and give you personalized tips on improving as you begin.\n\n,\n\n\nIn addition to air temperature, check the water temperature, as the water is often much colder than the air.\nIf you have access to one, wear a wetsuit.,\n\n\nPractice holding your breath in increments, increasing the length of time you hold it.\nDo upper body exercises like push-ups and pull-ups to increase your arm power.\nFor overall kayaking improvement, do core exercises like planking and crunches for better body control.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":849}
{"text":" A good relationship with your teacher can mean recommendations to a university or even a job. Getting your first job is difficult without any experiences so you have to rely on your references. If your teacher likes you, she can be the reference you need.If you have questions about your career goals, your teacher may know contacts who can mentor you. For example, your science teacher may know chemists who can answer any questions you have or even offer you an internship.;\n, Your teacher may help you both find and apply for grants and scholarships. If you are having problems making friends or just looking for extracurricular activities, your teacher can help you meet new friends and pursue extracurricular activities to help you fill out your resume or college applications.If your school has study abroad or exchange programs, your teacher may be a great resource to help you fill out the application or find information about other cities and schools you may be interested in exchanging to.\n\n, Your teacher may be a great resource to help you find community programs that suit your interests. You may also need your teacher\u2019s support in order to run for a student office. Both cases look great in a college application or when applying for a job., Your teacher may be a valuable mentor, provide guidance, or give another adult perspective when you need one. Get answers to questions you can\u2019t ask your parents, ask for advice or general help with personal problems., Do you not get along with your teacher because you dislike the subject she teaches? Your relationship with your teacher can be affected if you don\u2019t find the class engaging. Think of the class as step to the finish line. Whether your goal is graduating or making it to a prestigious university, keep perspective to help you get through a tough class.Find the practical value of a class you don\u2019t enjoy. For example, if you hate math think about how you can use it to calculate how much money you need to save each month to get you a car before sophomore year in college.If you don\u2019t like a class because the subject is difficult, ask your teacher or parents for extra help. If you mention your difficulties to your teacher, she may be able to provide you with another perspective to get you engaged. For example, if you are having problems with history she may assign you a project to work with your grandparents in order to learn about their experience with the war they experienced growing up as kids.\n\n, You can learn more than just homework and class work as teachers know more than just their subject matter. Teachers can help you become a well-informed and insightful person. There will always be at least one teacher who will stand out and change your life. You won\u2019t know who that is until you make a connection., While you may find class or homework difficult, you can always put in maximum effort. Make sure to submit everything on time and be on time for class. When in class, be respectful, stay alert, and ask questions to keep yourself involved., Your teacher has an obvious interest in the subject he is teaching so the more engaged you become in the subject, the more attention your teacher can give you. If you have a genuine interest in the subject your teacher may also provide guidance in making it a career path., Get extra help, ask general questions about how to do better in school or how to get a job, or ask about how you are doing in your teacher\u2019s class. You may find that your teacher is easier to talk to when not in front of the class.Do not ask for a meeting if you do not have anything prepared. You do not want to waste your teacher\u2019s time or yours.\n\n, It\u2019s impossible to get your teacher to like you if you don\u2019t show up to clas. If you need to be absent, make sure to let your teacher know in advance or email her as soon as you are able. When in class, be attentive and participate. You should be a welcome presence in the classroom., Even if an assignment is not due for several weeks, study to ensure you are prepared and keeping material fresh. Don\u2019t wait until the last minute to study or complete an assignment as your work will suffer. Include studying as part of your daily schedule., Don\u2019t slouch when the teacher is reading and take notes as you follow along. Write down any questions you may have and ask them at the appropriate time.Slouching or lying on your desk can not only make you tired but it can also be seen as disrespectful to your teacher.\n\n, Finding a regular studying location gets your mind prepared to work each time you arrive. Make sure that there is no noise and minimum distraction so that your work can have your complete focus. Try not to listen to music, talk to friends, or eat at your studying place., Don\u2019t try to cram a lot of information in long study sessions as your memory won\u2019t be able to retain everything. A great rule is to study two hours for each hour of class.Studying three times a week for one hour works better than studying once a week for three hours as you\u2019ll be less fatigued and be able to concentrate better at each hour long session.\n\n, Schedule yourself to finish papers and assignments several days early. Give yourself time to revise them and ask for additional help at your school\u2019s writing center if you have one. You may even get friends to read it or get guidance from your teacher., Use your teacher\u2019s office hours to your advantage. Your teacher has office hours for a reason as he wants to help you succeed. Come prepared with questions, even if they are about assignments due later in the year., While everything can be found online, the library is a great resource to help streamline your research. Talk to the librarian to help you find books, papers, or other resources for your assignment., Ask your teacher for helpful study tips. She may give you specific chapters to focus on. Assemble a study group to help support each other and test each other prior to the exam. Studying early lets you find the most effective study method that works for you., School should not feel like a chore. A happy and productive student is a great addition to any classroom. Your teacher will appreciate you if you brighten up her day with your enthusiasm and attitude., School can be stressful so join a club, sports team, or simply participate in activities like free movie nights to give yourself some relief from stress. Check your school paper or community bulletin board for activities or clubs that you can join.Becoming a well-rounded student also helps with job and college applications as well as helps with social skills.\n\n, Whether you have a job or are in a club, you should not neglect your studies. Extracurricular activities are meant to round your out as a person. Make sure you prioritize your schedule.If you have a goal to save money with your job, make sure you can handle your workload and don\u2019t over commit. While money is a great incentive for hard work, it is short-sighted to place material possessions over education.\n\n, It\u2019s difficult to get along with everyone all the time. Your teacher is a person with a unique personality. Learning to get along with different people is an important life skill. Learn more about your teacher until you find some common ground and work from there.No matter what your life goals are, you will always encounter people that you don\u2019t completely get along with. Learning how to relate to your teacher can be invaluable moving forward. For example, ask about where your teacher grew up or what hobbies he likes. He may surprise with similar music tastes or similar religious background.\n\n, Any relationship needs respect so don\u2019t expect to have a good relationship with your teacher without showing her respect first. Be polite and courteous even if you don\u2019t agree with your teacher\u2019s opinion. Be a responsible student and let your teacher know when you need to miss class or when you will make up for a late assignment.Don\u2019t think your time is more important than any other student\u2019s. Showing initiative and being responsible for yourself is a great way to keep your teacher\u2019s respect and keep you in high regard.\n\n, Teachers will resent you if you are being insincere with your efforts to make a connection. Your teacher will be able to sense if you suddenly change your demeanor after asking for a college reference or a job recommendation., Your classmates will resent you if your actions are phony and your teacher may call you out in front of the entire class if she finds your actions to be too much., There may be rules for your teacher not to accept any gifts but it\u2019s find to show your gratitude if your teacher has helped you. However, if you give him something expensive or flashy, that could send a wrong message and get you in a lot of trouble.It is a teacher\u2019s job to help her students and your education and well-being is reward enough. While material gifts may seem like a good gesture, doing well in school and growing up into a productive member of your community is exactly what your teacher hopes for you.\n\n, You may question a grade or ask to retake a test but don\u2019t do this more than once. If you continually second-guess your teacher, he will see that as disrespectful and come to resent you. If you always knit pick about points for a grade, you may wear your teacher\u2019s patience., Your teacher may be affected by something happening in her personal life. Don\u2019t be quick to judge if your teacher seems to be off. Your teacher may be cranky, irritable or unable to concentrate because of job stress, family problems, or health issues.Conversely, don\u2019t automatically assume your teacher is going through personal issues. Your teacher may become offended if you make false accusations.\n\n, If you constantly butt heads with your teacher, keep in mind your permanent record will reflect all the disciplinary action that you have received. This may make it extremely difficult to get into college or get a job., Talking while the teacher is talking can be very disruptive. In contrast, sleeping, doodling, or text messaging can also be distracting and is very disrespectful to your teacher. When you do participate in class don\u2019t be rude or try to be the class clown.There\u2019s a difference between participation and being obnoxious. While making your classmates laugh may be fun, there is an appropriate time and place., Let her know why you feel your relationship is strained. For example say something like, \u201cI feel embarrassed when it\u2019s like you're trying to single me out\" or \"I feel like you only ask the same people to volunteer.\" Try to work together to find a solution., If you don\u2019t mesh with your teacher\u2019s personality, get to know her and what she is knowledgeable about so that you find some common ground. There is a part of your teacher\u2019s personality that you can use as a tool to help you learn. You will strengthen your relationship with her as you try to find that part of her personality., Perhaps this isn\u2019t just an isolated incident. Talk to your peers and ask them for tips, tools, and create a plan to get along with your teacher. Sharing notes can help you get support and another perspective on how to understand a subject.If you\u2019re too shy to talk to your classmates, watch what the successful ones do and try to mimic their actions. You\u2019ll find that a lot of them ask a lot of questions and frequently participate in class.\n\n, If you have exhausted all your resources and made a genuine effort to build a relationship with your teacher, ask your school guidance counselor or vice principal for help. They may be able to offer tips or act as mediator to help you and your teacher come up with a solution., Let your parents or guardians know that you are having problems getting along with your teacher. Let them know why you think your relationship is strained and what you have done to try to rectify it. Your parents or guardian may be able to meet with your teacher and better express how you\u2019re feeling., If you encounter and physical or verbal abuse, like racist or sexual comments, report it immediately to your principal, parents, and even police. If your teacher is making you uncomfortable in any way you do not need to put up with it.Don\u2019t keep your safety and well-being at risk or the safety and well-being of other students at risk by remaining silent. Your teacher should not be abusing his position so don\u2019t feel intimidated or scared. Your principal, other teachers, and parents will all all put an immediate stop to inappropriate behaviour and you won\u2019t have to deal with your teacher again.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":850}

{"text":" Depending on your grade, your report card may have information that doesn't fall into the typical A or B in math or science category. Your report card may show social skills or work habits, like pays attention or talks too much. It may also give grades like S, N, or D for satisfactory, needs improvement, or developing.Make sure to ask your teacher to explain any unclear parts of your report card. You want to be able to explain your grades to your parents as knowledgeably as possible.\n\n\nKnow what your grades are based on. Have you only had one test you bombed, or have you had 5 tests this grading period? How many quizzes, tests, and homework assignments are included?You might also want to gather together some of your tests, quizzes, and homework so you can go over them with your parents.\nAnother thing to think about is what kind of report card this is. Some schools give report cards every 9 weeks to show the student's progress through the semester. These 9 week report card grades are not the ones that will be put down into your records; they can be improved. If your school does semester report cards, the report card you get that lists the grades for the entire semester is important because these are the grades that will go into your records and stay with you. Make sure you understand how your school does report cards and which ones are temporary and permanent.;\n, Write down all the reasons you can think of for why you got bad grades in the classes you struggled in. One of the first things your parents might ask you is why this happened, so have an answer ready for your parents. Be honest in your self-evaluation. Some reasons for why you\u2019re not doing well in a class might be:\n\n\nYou sit next to a friend and get easily distracted.\nYou find the teacher boring and fall asleep in class.\nYou like to relax or have fun after school instead of doing your homework.\nYou don\u2019t like the subject matter, so you don\u2019t pay attention.\nYou understand the material pretty well, but you have test anxiety that drags down your test scores.You\u2019re trying your best and paying attention, but you can\u2019t keep up.\nThe teacher doesn't prepare you well enough for the quizzes and exams. Are other people struggling in this class, too?\n\n, You\u2019ll probably know that your report card is going to be bad before you get it, so talk to your teachers before report-card day to get your improvement plan under way. Be honest with your teachers about your reasons for struggling in the class.\n\n\nAsk if there is any extra credit you can earn through extra work.\nAsk what they think the problem is with your performance. Teachers have a lot of experience with struggling students; they might be able to see some problems in your performance that you wouldn\u2019t even be able to recognize as problematic.\nAsk for advice on how to better understand the material.\n\n, Remember to use all the information and ideas you came up with in your self-evaluation and your conversation with your teacher to figure out how to do better during your next grading period.By approaching your parents with a plan for improvement, you\u2019ll show them that you understand that you made a mistake and, more importantly, that you\u2019re mature enough to take steps to fix the situation. This will likely make them trust you more when you promise to improve your grades. Some ways to improve your grades might be to:\n\n\nStay after school for tutoring with the teacher.\nDo the extra credit you discussed with your teacher.\nSit somewhere where you can\u2019t see or talk to the friend who distracts you in class.\nMake sure you get enough sleep every night and eat a good breakfast that gives you the energy to stay awake all day.Come up with a list of ways that the information covered in this class will be useful to you later in life. You may not want to be a mathematician when you grow up \u2014 maybe you want to be a writer. But you still need to get good grades in math to get into college!\n\n, You might be the kind of person who needs to work all in one stretch, so make a schedule where you start homework the second you get home from school, then relax for the rest of the evening. If you\u2019re always burned out by the time school ends, then give yourself an hour or two of break time when you get home from school. Figure out what works best for you.\n\n\nThe important thing is that you start your homework at the same time every single day. Routine is an important part of making studying a part of your life.\n\n, Why are these grades important to you? What do you want to do later in life? Most students want to go to college and get a job. Do you know the kinds of schools you want to apply to or what subject you'd like to study? Knowing the scholastic expectations and what kind of grades you need for your colleges can help you figure out if A's, B's, or C's will suffice.\n\n\nReport cards aren't just about getting a grade. Report cards should reflect your hard work, improvement, and learning of the subject matter. You want to foster a love of learning, or at the least, an understanding about why learning and hard work is important., Though the impulse may be strong to just hide the report card from your parents, resist the temptation. Hiding your grades will point to your immaturity, while taking responsibility and approaching your parents shows maturity. Your parents may also be madder if you hide it from them, which is something you definitely don't want.\n\n\nDon't put off telling your parents, either. You don't want them to ask, \"Why are you just telling me about this now!\" or \"Why didn't you tell me as soon as you got the report card?\", Even if you approach a more understanding parent individually at first, eventually you\u2019re going to have to talk to both of them together. By addressing them both in person, you show them that you\u2019re owning up to your mistakes and are willing to have hard discussions with them. This will go a long way toward earning their respect.\n\n\nTell them that you have some bad grades before showing them the actual report card. It\u2019s easier to hear something than to see it in black and white, so the shock won\u2019t be as jarring for them.\n\n, When you talk to your parents, explain why you think you did poorly this grading period.This opens up a dialogue between you and your parents. You want to communicate to them that you are aware of your performance and your strengths and weaknesses. Show them the list you made and go through all the reasons together. Have an honest discussion.\n\n\nDon't provide excuses. Refrain from saying things like, \"My teacher is mean!\" or \"It's not my fault!\" Also, don't lie or deny what the report card says by saying, \"I didn't know I was missing homework\" or \"I didn't know I talked too much in class.\"Take responsibility for your actions. This shows your parents you are mature, responsible, and willing to improve.\n\n, Present your parents with the way in which you plan to improve your grades. Explain the reasoning behind your plan and why you think it will work. Write down the plan and give it to your parents so they know the steps you are taking.Ask them for their advice on how you could improve it further.\n\n\nExplain to your parents that you are not satisfied with your grade. This shows them that you are taking this very seriously.Don't just tell your parents that you are going to do better - show them. Giving them a structured plan of how you aim to improve shows them you are serious about improving.\n\n, Knowing what you and your parents think are good and bad grades and comments can help you face your report cards. This also helps you understand their expectations of you.\n\n\nAt the beginning of each school year, after a bad report card, or whenever you first think about it, you and your parents should get together and discuss what they expect your performance in school to be, what you expect your performance to be, and what you think you can achieve. This puts you and your parents on the same page, and gives you a mental idea of what you want to achieve.\nKeep in mind that doing well in school doesn't mean perfect straight A's. Not every student is a straight A student. For some students, their best is B's or even C's. Maybe A's in English is normal for you, but C's in math is an improvement. Strive to be the best you can be, but don't have impossible goals for yourself.Remember that as you move through school, the work will become more challenging. Don't freak out if you start making B's in a class you may have made A's in as you move to middle and high school. If this happens to you, explain to your parents that geometry was easy, but algebra and trig are much more difficult for you. Tell your parents that physical science was easier than chemistry., During your talk with your parents, point out the positive things on your report card. Even if you get some bad grades, it is important to focus on the good things on your report card. Sometimes, this might be difficult, but highlight any of your achievements. Did you get a positive effort comment from your teacher, or perfect attendance?One of the most important things to focus on are any academic achievements or improvements - no matter how small. Did you bring your grade up two points? Did you maintain your B average in science?\nDon't let the bad grades erase all the good work you did that is reflected on your report card. Also evaluate your bad grade - are you and your parents unhappy with your C in history? Is that C an improvement over your grade last term? If so, focus on the improvement and vow to keep improving it since you already have!\n\n, Your parents were kids once, too, so don\u2019t assume that they\u2019re going to come down hard on you. They probably remember getting bad report cards themselves, and if this is your first one, ask them to be understanding. Remember, if you talk to them calmly and maturely, you will set a positive example.\n\n\nStay polite and respectful, even when you get frustrated. When your parents get your news, they may be shocked and a little angry, but don\u2019t let yourself get defensive or angry in return.\nBe willing to take the punishments they throw at you like an adult.\n\n, No report card is the end of the world. There is always room to improve and to better yourself and your grades. Plus, you now have a plan on how to fix the problem! You know how to do better, so promise your parents and yourself that you\u2019ll follow through. Improving your grades should be as much about yourself as it is for your parents.\n\n\nDon't get so discouraged and upset that you give up. Don't tell your parents, \"I can't improve! I'm a loser! I'm stupid! This is impossible!\" These types of thoughts aren't encouraging to your or your parents. Start by giving yourself small goals if the end goal seems too unattainable. Try saying, \"I will improve my next quiz and test grade by 5 or 10 points.\" These small goals will add up to a noticeable larger improvement.\n\n, Do you think that part of the reason you're struggling in class is that the teacher might be at fault? Be very honest here \u2014 don't just blame the teacher if it's really your fault that you're doing poorly in school. Blaming the teacher without a good reason will only get you in hotter water \u2014 both at home and at school. However, if you know that many other students in the class are struggling and that the teacher hasn't prepared you well enough to pass his or her exams, let your parents know that your teacher might be part of the problem.\n\n\nSuggest holding a parent-teacher conference where you are included. Talking to both your teacher and parents not only can help give you motivation and tips on how to improve, but it shows them that you are serious about your achievement.Be thoughtful in how you present this argument. Your parents might assume that you're trying to shift the blame, so give enough evidence to convince them that the teacher might be at least part of the problem.\n\n, Promise that you won\u2019t resent them for helping you stick to your own plan. Some other ways parents can help you study include:\n\n\nExplaining difficult concepts in their own words. Sometimes teachers and textbooks phrase things in ways that are difficult to grasp. Maybe your parents, who know you and how your brain works, can explain things more clearly.\nHelping you make flash cards for yourself.\nQuizzing you.\nGoing over your homework to make sure you didn\u2019t make any errors, and helping you correct those errors.\nGiving you extra assignments outside of school to give you more practice on the concepts you\u2019re struggling with.\nYou need to understand that your parents are very busy, and they may not have as much time to spend on your homework as they\u2019d like to. It\u2019s ultimately your own responsibility to study for school, so be grateful to your parents for any extra help they can give you.\n\n, A private tutor will be specially trained to help you catch up to the rest of your classmates, but they can be pretty expensive. Don't hold it against your parents if they can\u2019t hire one for you.\n\n\nIf a private tutor isn\u2019t an option, consider asking a classmate who\u2019s doing very well in the class to be your tutor. This way, you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re working alone, and your parents won\u2019t have to spend a bunch of money on a tutor.\n\n, Keeping your parents informed about your grades through the school year eliminates any surprises on the report cards. Show them tests and quizzes when they are returned. Another idea is to take time every weekend to go over the past week's assignments. This keeps you and your parents aware of your progress.\n\n\nKeeping up with your assignments can also help you to identify any struggles you are having. If you suddenly got a bad grade on a quiz or a test, you and your parents can discuss what might be the problem and figure out how to correct it. This helps you deal with any difficulties you have in school before they become a huge problem.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":852}

{"text":" For the purpose of this guide, we\u2019ll call the router that\u2019s connected to the Internet \u201cRouter 1\u201d and the new router \u201cRouter 2.\u201d;\n, To configure routers, you\u2019ll need a computer that can connect to them via an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi. The operating system of the computer doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n\nIf you\u2019ll be using Wi-Fi to connect to the routers, take note of the SSID and passkey for each router. You\u2019ll need this information to connect to each router via Wi-Fi.\n\n, If you plan to connect computers and other devices to the network without Wi-Fi, you\u2019ll need an Ethernet cable for each device.\n\n\nFor example, you\u2019ll need one Ethernet cable to connect Router 2 to Router 1.\nIf you wanted to connect two additional computers to the network, have additional Ethernet cables available for each device (unless you plan to connect them via Wi-Fi).\n\n,, You\u2019ll want to start wiring the network with the equipment turned off.\n\n,\n\n\nThe WAN port may be labeled \u201cInternet.\u201d\n\n,\n\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to connect the computer to the router wirelessly, use your router\u2019s instructions to do so.\n\n, Wait a few moments for them both to come back up.\n\n, You\u2019ll need a web browser to connect to the admin interface of Router 1.\n\n, This address is printed somewhere on Router 1.\n\n\nHere are some default IP addresses for common router brands:\n\n2Wire: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.254, 10.0.0.138\nApple: 10.0.0.1\nBelkin: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1\nDlink: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.101, 192.168.0.30, 192.168.0.50, 192.168.15.1, 192.168.254.254, 192.168.1.254, 192.168.0.10, 192.168.15.1, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.1.1.1, 10.90.90.90,\nNetgear: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.227, These credentials, like the IP address, can be found printed on Router 1.\n\n\nIf there is no username and password combination printed on your router, search the internet for \u201cdefault router password for \u201d.\nIf you\u2019re using the right password but still can\u2019t connect, reset the router to its default settings by inserting the end of a paperclip into its \u201creset\u201d port.,\n\n\nThe DHCP settings are located in different places across different types of routers, but you\u2019ll usually find them under \u201cNetwork settings,\u201d or \u201cLAN settings.\u201d\nIn most cases, the DHCP server is turned on by default.\n\n, Visit any website (like https:\/\/www.wikihow.com) to verify that you can connect to the Internet. Make sure that the physical configuration of your network leaves room for one LAN port to be open on Router 1.\n\n, Everything else can remain on and plugged in.\n\n, Now you\u2019ll configure Router 2 as a second router on the same subnet. This means all devices on the network will be able to access each other.\n\n,, Just as when you logged into Router 1 as an administrator, you\u2019ll need to do this to Router 2. Log in to the router\u2019s admin interface using your credentials. Check and see what the IP is; most routers default to 192.168.0.1, 192.168.1.1, or 10.0.0.1.\n\n, Locate the DHCP settings (as you did earlier for Router 1) and switch the DHCP server to \u201cOff.\u201d\n\n, That needs to change.\n\n\nFind the area in the router admin website called \u201cLAN\u201d or \u201cLocal Network.\u201d There should be a blank that contains the current IP address (the one you connected to in your web browser).\nType a new IP address in place of the existing one. The new address must be on the same subnet as Router 1, meaning the first three sets of numbers (out of four) in the IP address must be the same as Router 1. It also can\u2019t be an IP currently assigned to another device.\nIf Router 1\u2019s IP address is 192.168.0.1, for example, Router 2 can be 192.168.0.100. Since the computer is the only other device on the network, there\u2019s little risk for an IP address conflict.\n\n, If it is, assign it the same SSID (the name of the Wi-Fi access point) and passkey as Router 1.\n\n\nYou should find these settings under a menu called something like \u201cWireless\u201d or \u201cWi-Fi setup.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re unsure of Router 1\u2019s SSID and passkey, it should be printed on the device.\n\n, Now that Router 2\u2019s all set up, it\u2019s a good idea to give it a restart\u2014though, for now, leave the power unplugged instead of turning it right back on.\n\n, Make sure you\u2019re not plugging it into the WAN port (they look similar).\n\n, When the router comes back up, it will have the IP address you configured. As long as Router 1 has Internet access, Router 2 will now also be online.\n\n,, Router 1\u2019s DHCP server will automatically assign each device its own IP address in the same subnet.

{"text":" Free radicals in your stomach can break down your stomach lining, making your ulcer worse.Antioxidants are known as free radical scavengers \u2014 they destroy the free radicals that could cause you harm. Because of this, you should eat foods that contain antioxidants. These include:Red wine\nPomegranate juice\nGrape juice\nBuckwheat\nBarley\nBeans and lentils\nNuts (walnuts, peanuts, hazelnuts, almonds, etc.)\nChocolate\nBerries (blueberries, cranberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc.)\nCertain spices (including clove, allspice, cinnamon)\nCertain herbs (including peppermint, oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary)\nTomato products (sauces, sun-dried tomatoes);\n, Flavonoids are found in many plants and are defined as organic compounds of biological pigments. Flavonoids also fight free radicals, meaning they are protectors of your stomach lining, just like antioxidants.Foods rich in flavonoids include:\n\n\nBlueberries\nStrawberries\nPeaches\nApples\nOranges\nCelery\nBlack beans\nBlack, green, and oolong teas\nBeer\n\n, While it is an uncommon drink, cabbage juice is very effective in curing stomach ulcers. Cabbage is naturally rich in bacteria that produce lactic acid; these bacteria are essential in fighting and destroying the bacteria that causes ulcers.You should drink 50 ml of cabbage juice twice a day when your stomach is empty.\nCabbage juice can be made at home using a juicer, or can be purchased from some markets and health stores.\n\n, Research has also shown that cranberry juice is powerful when it comes to preventing bad bacteria from fusing to the lining of your stomach.\n\n\nYou can drink cranberry juice, eat fresh cranberries, or take cranberry supplements (available from pharmacies and vitamin stores).\n\n, Research shows that powerful wound-healing agents are found in white sweet potatoes.Eating these may help heal your ulcer. You can find white sweet potatoes at many markets and prepare them in several ways, including steaming and baking.\n\n, Research and tradition demonstrate that honey is a powerful natural antibiotic. For this reason, it can help fight the H. pylori bacteria that cause ulcers.Try to consume a couple spoonfuls of honey each day to combat your ulcer.\n\n, Licorice extract is available from many markets, pharmacies, and health stores.\n\n\nTalk to your doctor before starting a licorice regimen and discuss other medications you may be taking. Licorice supplements taken with with diuretics, corticosteroids, or other medicines that lower the body\u2019s potassium levels could reduce potassium to dangerous levels.Take licorice supplements as instructed by your doctor.\n\n, Research indicates that eating bananas can help treat the symptoms of stomach ulcers by helping to protect the lining of the stomach.Though it will not heal an existing ulcer, eating bananas may help treat your symptoms.\n\n\nDried unripe plantains may also help, but ripe plantains do not seem to have a positive effect., When you would normally put a pat of butter in the frying pan to cook your eggs or vegetables in, you should instead use olive oil. These oils contain healthy fats that are processed more easily than the heavier fats found in animal products like butter.You can also try cooking with coconut oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil or safflower oil\n\n, A bland diet concentrates on easily-digestible, low-fiber foods. These are gentle on your stomach and are less likely to irritate ulcers.You should talk with your doctor about whether or not a bland diet is a good treatment for your ulcer, and how long to follow it if it is. Foods you can eat on a bland diet include:\n\n\nLow-fat dairy products (milk, yogurt, etc.)\nCooked, canned, or frozen vegetables without seasoning\nFruit and vegetable juices\nApplesauce\nHot cereals\nLean, tender meats such as boiled chicken or baked fish, without seasonings\nCreamy peanut butter\nTofu\n\n, While alcoholic drinks like wine can have some health benefits, alcohol can irritate the lining of your stomach. When you have an ulcer caused by H. pylori, alcohol only makes the situation worse.,, Spicy foods might make ulcers more painful if you already have one, but they won\u2019t cause one.It is best to avoid all spicy foods (hot peppers, hot sauces, etc.) if you have an existing ulcer or are predisposed to them.\n\n, These fats are hard to digest, which can irritate ulcers.\n\n,, If you are addicted to tobacco products, talk to your doctor about treatments that can help you quit so that your ulcer can heal.\n\n, These common pain relievers, fever reducers, and anti-inflammatory medications may cause ulcers in some people, especially if taken for extended periods of time or at high doses. If you are taking NSAIDs for an existing condition, talk to your doctor about other medications you can take instead (such as acetaminophen).\n\n, If you are suffering from one, avoiding or reducing stress factors can help you heal faster.

{"text":" This may sound like an odd thing to do, but your corn needs to sprout and putting it in a burlap sack will the sprouting process along. Once all of your corn is contained in the burlap sack, cover the sack with warm water. You can do this by placing the bag in a tub or large (super large) bucket., You will need to keep the corn moist for roughly 10 days. Check your corn for sprouts. When the sprouts have grown so that they are \u00bc of an inch long, your corn is ready for the next step in the recipe., Wash your corn in a tub, making sure to scrub away any dirt along with the corn sprouts. If your corn has roots, scrub these away too. Move the washed corn to your primary fermenter.\n\n, This is called making the mash. Make sure that each kernel gets thoroughly cracked. When you are sure all of the kernels are cracked, add five gallons of boiling water to your mash.\n\n, When the water has cooled down to 86\u00ba F (30\u00ba C) add one cup of champagne yeast starter. Mix the ingredients together., When the water has reached the desired temperature, add seven pounds of rye grain, two pounds of barley, and one pound of malt. Stir all of the ingredients together., You will have to constantly stir the mixture. While stirring, increase the temperature of the mash by five degrees every two minutes. When the temperature reaches 160 \u00baF (71.1\u00baC), do not raise the temperature anymore., You will need to keep the temperature at 160\u00baF (71.1\u00baC) so that the starch turns into fermentable sugar and dextrin. This can only be achieved by continuing to stir for two to three hours.\n\n, Let your mash cool down to 70\u00baF (21.1\u00baC). Add three grams of yeast and stir the mixture well.\n\n, You can use a funnel to pour your mash into the fermenter of your choice. Many home brewers use glass carboys, which are essentially large glass bottles. You can often buy them with an air lock (which you will definitely need).You can also make your own air lock. To do this, drill a hole in your carboy cork or lid that exactly the size of surgical tubing (which you will also need for this method to work). Once you have drilled the hole, run the surgical tubing into the hole, letting the other end of the tubing hang down into a glass or jar of water.\n\n, Once you have added all of the mash and yeast, you will need to seal your fermenter with an airlock so that absolutely no air can get in or out of your fermentation device. The process of fermentation involves the sugars in your mash, like glucose or fructose, getting converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide., The length of time you should let your mash ferment will depend on the recipe you used. It could anywhere from a couple of days to longer than a week. For the corn whiskey recipe listed above, let your mash ferment for seven to ten days. For the rye whiskey recipe, let the mash ferment for five to seven days., There are several ways to tell you can safely take your whiskey out of your fermenter. The best and most accurate way to tell if the fermentation process has ended is by using a hydrometer, though you can also do a visual inspection.Using a Hydrometer: Hydrometers measure the density of a liquid compared to the density of water. When the mash is done fermenting, the number reading on the hydrometer should stay the same. You should take a reading one time each day, for three days around the time when your recipe says your mash should be done fermenting. A good way to use the hydrometer is to take a sample of your mash by using a wine thief or turkey baster. Put this small sample into a graduated cylinder. Lower the hydrometer into the cylinder and gently swirl it around to release any bubbles. Take a reading right at the level of the liquid. This reading should be the same for three days in a row.\n\n, It is recommended that you use a hydrometer to determine whether or not your mash is done fermenting, however if you really don\u2019t want to buy one, you can try to do a visual inspection of your fermenter. Inspect the top outer edge of the fermenter. Are there any bubbles being formed? The day that you notice there are no bubbles forming, give your mash one more day to ferment and then move on to the distillation process.\n\n, The process of distillation focuses on separating the ethanol (alcohol) created in the fermentation process from the wort (or used mash). The goal is to get 80% ethanol and 20% flavors and water from the mash., For safety reasons, it is generally in your best interest to buy a copper or stainless steel still from a still making company. There are plenty of websites that have quality stills for purchase. If, however, you would prefer to take on the project of building your own still, you can learn how to do so here.\n\n, Fermented wort is referred to as \u2018wash\u2019. To transfer your wash, you will need to strain or siphon your wash through a cheesecloth and then into your still. The cheesecloth is necessary because you want to allow as few of the larger chunks of mash into the still as possible. If you choose to siphon your wash rather than strain in, try to leave as much of the solid chunks in the bottom of the fermenter.If you do end up with some of the larger chunks in your still, its not the end of the world. You can leave them in there.\n\n, Again, if you have made your own still and want to refer back to the wikiHow instructions, click here. Once the rest of the still is assembled, slowly heat your wash. If you heat your wash too quickly, you may burn it. Over the course of 30 to 60 minutes, bring your wash to a boil.\n\n, On your still, there should be a thermometer placed right before the cooling condenser. As the wash boils, keep on an eye on this thermometer. When it reads 120\u00ba F- 140\u00ba F (50\u00ba C-60\u00ba C), start the cooling water for the condenser tube. Doing this will begin your distillation process., Once you have added the cooling water, the condenser will begin to drip. For a wash that is five gallons in size, you will want to throw out the first 50 milliliters (1.7\u00a0\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) (\u00bc cup) that comes out of the condenser. This first bit is called the \u2018head\u2019 and is the methanol boiling out of the wash. The head has a nasty flavor that you will not want mixing with the rest of your whiskey.\n\n, Once you have thrown out the head, read the thermometer again. It should read 175\u00ba F-185\u00ba F (80\u00ba C-85\u00ba C). At this time, the distillate coming out of the distiller is the ethanol boiling off, or the \u201cbody\u201d. This is the liquid gold you\u2019ve been waiting for. You will want to collect the body in 500 milliliters (16.9\u00a0\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) containers so that you can keep track of your product., When the temperature has reached roughly 205\u00ba F (96\u00ba C), you will want to stop collecting the distillate. The liquid now coming out of the distiller is call the \u2018tails\u2019. This will also give your whiskey a bad flavor, so keep it separate from the body.\n\n, After you have collected all of your distillate, you will need to let each part of the still cool (be careful--it is very hot). Once it has cooled, clean it well.\n\n, Most whiskeys are aged in oak barrels. However, if you don\u2019t have any oak barrels on hand, you can also add oak chips to your whiskey while it ages in another jar or container. Allowing the whiskey to age will give it that beautiful whiskey flavor that we all love. You can buy both charred oak barrels and oak chips online.If you choose to age your whiskey in a jar or other closed container, you will need to regularly open the jar to let the alcohol vapors escape as they would do if being aged in a wooden barrel (this escaped vapor is called the \u201cangels share\u201d). Let your jars breath once a week at a minimum.\nIf you choose to use a barrel, fill your barrel with warm water first. Doing this will cause the wood to swell, effectively sealing off any cracks the wood might have. This is important to do or else your whiskey might leak out of your barrel.\n\n, When making whiskey at home, the aging process takes a lot less time than commercial distillers take, as you are no doubt making a much smaller batch of whiskey. Because of this, your whiskey is more exposed to the wood of the barrel or chips, because there is less liquid vying for a spot up against the wood. Your whiskey will be aged in a matter of months.\n\n, When aging whiskey at home, there is a chance that you might \u2018over oak\u2019 your liquor. To avoid this, sample your whiskey once every three or so weeks., To determine your whiskey\u2019s alcohol content (ABV) you can use your distiller\u2019s hydrometer. Keep in mind that a whiskey with 75 to 80% alcohol is going to be a relatively unpleasant thing to drink. In general, whiskey gets diluted to 80 proof, or 40% alcohol. To dilute, add water.\n\n, Once your whiskey has reached the taste and color you prefer, its time to bottle it. Store your bottled whiskey or enjoy it immediately, the choice is yours. Enjoy!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":859}
{"text":" Google something like \"high school exchange programs to China\", and hopefully you'll get a few hits of agencies that place students from the US in other countries, or the other way around.;\n, Most exchange program agencies require students to be a minimum age of 15, and some require you to have a GPA of at least 2.8 to be able to apply.\n\n, Trimesters are often much cheaper, and you can get a good \"gist\" of a culture by being there a few months (usually 2 to 3.) Semesters are usually the best, because you're not away from home from too long and you usually have enough time to get a great experience of the culture, take some interesting classes, and they're cheaper than full school years. Full school years would definitely be the most culturally stimulating of the options, and you'd definitely get an amazing experience, but it comes at a considerable cost, and you'd be away from home for a good while (usually 9-10 months.)\n,, Usually you'll hear back whether you're accepted or not accepted.\n\n, Scholarships are usually given based on how high your GPA is, and financial aid is based on need. You could also do your part by getting a job (with reasonable hours) or fund raising.\n\n, If you know the name of the school you'll be going to, research it online. Look into their classes, extracurriculars, and the surrounding city. This background knowledge will make you a little less nervous when it's time to leave.\n\n, Usually you can get credit for the classes you take overseas, but if there's still a class you need to take that the school in your program country doesn't offer, take it before or after you leave.\n\n, This will make it a lot easier to talk to them in person once you get there, and they won't seem like such strangers if you've had prior communication.\n, Make a thorough check list of everything you'll need, and check it off as you go. As you'll be leaving for 3-10 months, you'll need to pack a LOT of stuff. Find the biggest suitcase in your house (if you don't have one, it might be a good idea to get one), and pack as much in it as you can. Be aware of any weight restrictions your airline has for baggage, and pack accordingly. Only pack things you really need (but of course things like books, magazines, iPods, and a few things that remind you of home are fine). If there is a weight restriction, try packing most of your things in a large suitcase you'll check at the airport, and packing the rest in a lighter bag you'll carry on the plane.\n\n, You'll need a lot while you're there, and as it's a whole new country, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to money. Your host family will probably only provide you with food and a place to stay, and anything else you may need will be your responsibility to get. You will want to get a few hundred US dollars worth of your host country's currency to start out, and also bring a credit card (for larger purchases) and an ATM card to withdraw bills monthly.\n\n, This will also provide you with a way to make calls and communicate with people while staying in your exchange country, and it will help you feel not so far away from home. You can also communicate through email and letters.\n\n, This is very likely a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so be sure to make the most of it!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":860}
{"text":" Scaffold can be rented, or purchased if you will be able to use it for numerous projects. The basic parts of a scaffold system include these items:\n\nScaffold jacks\nStacking pins\nLeveling legs or base plates\nBraces\nAccess ladders\nScaffold boards\nOutriggers\nVarious clamps and pins for assembly.;\n, There are a number of specialty rental companies that engineer and even assemble and disassemble scaffolding for projects. Having skilled workers erect the scaffolding is critical for safety and productivity, not to mention avoiding a possible fine by safety authorities like the OSHA (USA) or similar safety regulators., The ground or surface it will be erected on should be as level as possible, and soils should be compacted and have sufficient drainage to support the scaffold, even in wet weather., Installing the first level of scaffolding correctly will make completing the scaffold easier, and ensure the finished scaffold system will provide a safe, stable work platform when it is finished., Ladders should be furnished for access to each scaffold level, and workers should be provided with personal safety equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, and fall protection during the erection process., You may find you are able to install scaffold jacks with a minimal number of boards at each level, but since in normal masonry work there will be work to be performed from each level, having a complete deck will make stocking materials and accessing the work area safer and easier. Some things to consider when installing scaffold boards are:\n\nUse appropriate boards. Usually, scaffold boards are 2X10 (5x25cm) planks either grade-stamped number 1, laminated veneer lumber, or pinned scaffold boards.\nLap scaffold planks 6 inches (15.24 cm) on each side crossing the top rail of the jacks. Standard jacks are spaced 7 feet (2.1 meters) on center, so 8 foot (2.4 meters) or 16 foot (5.33 meters) boards are standard.\nCleat or nail boards together if necessary, to ensure they do not shift or slip during use.\nDiscard any split, rotted, or damaged scaffold boards.\nFit scaffold boards as tightly together as possible so that the materials will not fall through cracks to lower scaffold levels during use.\n\n, Handrails, toe-boards, and access gates should be installed before workers are allowed to work without fall protection, and materials are stocked on the scaffold deck., Depending on your location and work situation, government regulations may require scaffolds to be braced or supported before use. In the United States, the OSHA requires such bracing when a scaffold's height to width ratio 4 to 1 or greater. For example, a scaffold that is 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide has to be secured if it is 20 feet (6.09 meters) tall, or higher., Tags should be affixed at access locations and should include a daily inspection log that is signed and dated each day. Here are a few of the items which should be checked daily:\n\nCheck the scaffold support sills for erosion, undermining, and other deterioration.\nLook for braces and support members which are damaged or have been removed during the previous shift.\nCheck the condition of the scaffold planks, handrails, and toe boards.\nMake sure the work areas are clean and clear of debris.\nLook for any other obvious signs of damage or broken clamps, braces, or pins.\n\n, This will allow the workers to adjust the working height between each level, and enable them to work more efficiently., Large projects, and projects where large amounts of materials will be loaded at intervals, should have an access tower attached to the main scaffold system so that the weight of these materials will not be a hazard, and access for workers can be maintained on the scaffold deck. Avoid overloading scaffold decks. As a rule of thumb, any time the scaffold boards sag more than an inch (2.5 cm) or so, it is likely that they are overloaded.,, This is generally done in the reverse order of the assembly, and care should be taken to manage all materials so that they can be lowered safely to the ground. Cleaning loose debris and using buckets or bags to contain the small parts will help prevent items from being dropped where they may be damaged or lost, or workers could be injured., Rented scaffold should be counted and returned to the company it was rented from, and any damaged or missing items should be reported.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":861}

{"text":" It's easy to become anxious around another person who is anxious.Make sure to take deep, steady breaths. You need to stay calm in order to help your loved one calm down too. You need to keep your mind clear as a person who is having an anxiety attack is in fight or flight mode and won\u2019t be thinking logically., If possible, remove her from the environment that is triggering the anxiety attack. When a person is anxious, she believes she is in danger: anxiety is fear out of context.Taking her away from the situation she is currently in will help her feel safe. Sitting down will calm the adrenaline that is rushing through her body, and help take her out of fight or flight mode., If your loved one has been prescribed medication to take during an anxiety attack, offer it now. If you don\u2019t know, ask him what his prescribed dosage is. It\u2019s best to familiarize yourself with the dosage and contraindications of any medication your loved one has been prescribed. It\u2019s also good to know how long ago this medication was prescribed and what directions the doctor has given along with it., Speak in short, simple sentences and in a calming, comforting tone. The important thing is to remind her that she is not in danger, the anxiety she is feeling will passand that you\u2019re present and ready to be supportive. Reassuring things to say include\n\n\n\"It's going to be okay.\"\n\"You're doing just fine.\"\n\"Quiet your mind.\"\n\"You are safe here.\"\n\"I'm here for you.\"\n\n, Deep breathing alleviates symptoms of anxiety.Tell him to breathe with you. Tell him to inhale through his nose while you count to 5 and exhale through his mouth while you count to 5. Say, \"We can take some deep breaths together. Put your hands on your stomach, like this. When we breathe in, we'll feel our stomach rise and fall with our breath. I'll count as we hold it. Ready? In... one... two... three...four...five... out... one... two... three\u2026 four\u2026 five...\"\n\n, Bringing the focus on present reality will help a person having an anxiety attack realize that they are not in danger.Help her focus on and describe her immediate environment. You can also ask her to name all the furniture in the room, then all the wall decor in the room, etc. You want to help distract her from her internal experience by helping her focus on her external experience.\n\n, Some of the symptoms of anxiety attacks are similar to that of a heart attacks.If you\u2019re unsure of what is going on or if your loved one has another anxiety attack as soon as they have calmed down, call professionals for help. A medical expert can best assess the situation.\n\n, Anxiety may cause people to neglect their physical or emotional health, and you can help by suggesting that she do something if you notice she has forgotten.Self-soothing activities may be especially important if she has frequent anxiety. For example, ask her if she would like to get something to eat or suggest that she take a warm, long bath.\n\n\nWhen dealing with children, engage in relaxing activities together. Let them pick what they want to do.\n\n, Not everyone with anxiety will have an anxiety disorder but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need to be dealt with. Set aside 30 minutes out of the day, where your loved one can just have a good worry. During this time, don\u2019t let him be distracted by anything other than worrying and feeling anxious. Encourage him to think of solutions to his problems. This technique is effective with children as well as adults and helps them gain a sense of control over their problems., Your loved one may tell you why she feels upset, or you may have been able to tell based on what set off the anxiety. Try saying how upset she looks, and recognize that this is hard. This lets her know that you care, and that you think her struggles are valid. Ironically, affirming her stress can reduce it.\"That sounds really hard.\"\n\"I can see why that would be upsetting to you. It sounds like visiting your father can be difficult for you sometimes.\"\n\"You look stressed. Your face is scrunched up and you look hunched over. Do you want to talk about it?\"\n\n, Hugs can bring comfort to an anxious person.You may try to pat his back, give him a one-armed hug or put your arm around his shoulder to make him comfortable. Only do what you and he are comfortable with.\n\n\nAlways give him opportunities to decline. If he is dealing with sensory overload or are autistic, touch may make things worse. Or he may not be in the mood.\n\n, This can be an enormous relief to the anxious person.Be accommodating, and don't question her bad days or unusual needs. Treat her anxiety like a fact that, while unfortunate, is not a dreadful burden upon your life. Recognize that her feelings matter, and treat her with compassion, anxiety and all.\n\n\nBe flexible. It may take longer for people with anxiety problems to get ready for events such as getting ready for school. Factor in this time and allow for delays.\n\n, If your loved one isn't being treated already, seeing a doctor about his anxiety may allow him to get the help he needs. It\u2019s important to rule out any underlying medical or biological causes of the anxiety.Once you know that the cause of your loved one\u2019s anxiety is psychological, you will be in a better position to seek treatment. To give him a boost, you might suggest accompanying him to take notes, help him remember symptoms, or just for moral support.\n\n, Asking others for help can be very encouraging for a person with anxiety problems. In fact, persons with strong informal support networks have increase their chances of benefitting from treatment for anxiety. You don\u2019t have to do anything specific. Just knowing that there are people around with whom to talk to and share her worries with, can help a person with anxiety problems feel better., You can help them, and you can offer resources, but you can not cure his anxiety disorder.Any difficult symptoms or relapses are not your fault. Chronic anxiety changes the brain chemically and neurologicallyand this take time to heal.It is the responsibility of the individual to work with her doctor or psychologist and better herself.\n\n, Living with or being friends with someone with anxiety disorders\/problems can be taxing.Take plenty of time for yourself. You don\u2019t have to feel guilty. Your needs also matter, and your emotional health is important. Give yourself alone time and be willing to set boundaries. Turn off your phone at a certain time every night, and don't take calls. Be available for two hours, but then go home to relax.\n\n, It\u2019s important to have your own friends and family to support you too. Having someone to talk to about to encourage you to be patient will prevent burnout and keep your stress levels at bay.Taking care of yourself and being in a state of well-being, puts you in the best position to help someone with anxiety problems., It can be helpful to turn to experts to learn more about anxiety disorders, mental health, and positive coping mechanisms both during crises and in the long term. A psychologist can help you deal with your own feelings about handling a person with anxiety as well as give you strategies for taking care of her. Anxiety disorders also affect caregivers\u2019 health and relationship with the person suffering from the disorder., An anxiety disorder is more than temporary anxiety (worry or fear) that most people encounter from day to day and can become worse over time if not treated.This is especially important if you yourself have never had an anxiety disorder.\n\n, There is a significant difference between feeling anxious occasionally, such as when you\u2019re going for a job interview or meeting new people, and an anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a normal part of life.An anxiety disorder works on many levels: cognitive, biological, neurological and perhaps even genetic.An anxiety disorder will require professional help to be cured through talk therapy, medication, or both.This may sound difficult and with persistence, it can be done.\n\n, Knowing what your loved one is going through can give you empathy and put you in a better position to help him. If you know what type of anxiety disorder your loved one has, familiarize yourself with the particular symptoms of that order. Anxiety disorders include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia\/Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, PTSD and Separation Anxiety Disorder.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if your loved one has an anxiety disorder, look up the different symptoms of anxiety.\n\n, Anxiety disorders and attacks are not untreatable.You will be better able to help your loved ones during acute anxiety, when you know how to calm her down and alleviate her symptoms. Especially learn how to do breathing exercises and interventions that make a person focus on the here and now.

{"text":" According to standard MLA formatting rules, a cover page, or separate title page, is not necessary and should not be added to most papers.\n\n\nWith that in mind, sometimes an instructor will ask students to create a cover page for an MLA style paper, especially for long papers. There are guidelines concerning the type of information that should be included in this event.;\n, Your title should be centered and typed one-third of the way down from the top of the page.The title of your page should be informative yet creative.\nIf you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.\nThe first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d or \u201cto,\u201d unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.\n\n, In the middle of the page, still centered, you should type your name proceeded by the word \u201cBy.\u201d\n\n\nType \u201cBy\u201d on one line, hit the \u201cEnter\u201d key on your keyboard, and type or full name on the following line.\nYour name should be in FirstName LastName format.\n\n, Two-thirds down from the top of the page, you should include this block of essential information about the assignment itself.\n\n\nType the class and section number on one line.\nOn the line immediately after, write the instructor's name.\nOn the final line, type the date your paper is due in Month Numerical Day, Numerical Year format.\n\n, The top, bottom, left, and right margins should each be 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.\n\n\nFor most word processing programs, you can change the margins by heading into the \"Page Layout\" settings, usually located under a \"File\" menu. There should be a \"Margins\" heading in the dialog box. From there, change each margin to the appropriate size.\n\n, From the first page on, your entire paper should be double-spaced. Note that you do not need to include any extra space at the end of a paragraph.\n\n\nFor most word processing programs, you can change the spacing by going into the \u201cPage Layout\u201d settings, typically accessed from a \u201cFile\u201d menu.\u201d There should be a \u201cLine Spacing\u201d heading in the dialog box. Under that heading, select \u201c2.0\u201d spacing.\n\n, The preferred font and size for MLA papers is 12-point Times New Roman.\n\n\nIf you opt to use another font instead of Times New Roman, choose a font that is simple, easy to read, and not excessively large.\n\n, A running header will appear on each page in the same spot. It should include your last name and the page number of each page, and should be positioned in the upper right corner of the page.\n\n\nAccess the \"Header and Footer\" tool in your word processor, often found under the \"View\" menu. Type your last name and hit the page number icon in the options box to automatically insert the current page number on its corresponding page.\n\n, The heading essentially includes all the information a cover page would include when used. Type your full name, instructor's name, course name, and due date in the upper left corner.\n\n\nType your full name FirstName LastName on the first line.\nOn the next line, type your instructor's title and name.\nOn the third line, type the the class course number.\nInclude the date your assignment is due on the last line. It should be in Numerical Day Month Numerical Year format.\n\n, On the line immediately following the date, you should type your paper's title. This title should be centered.\n\n\nDo not make the title larger, italicized, underlined, or bold printed.\nThe title of your page should be informative yet creative.\nIf you include a subtitle, type it on the same line as the title and separate the two with a colon after the title.\nThe first letter of every major word should be capitalized. Do not capitalize minor words, like \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cand,\u201d or \u201cto,\u201d unless they are the first word of the title or subtitle.\n\n, On the line immediately following the title, left-align your text and begin writing the introduction paragraph of your paper.\n\n, The first line of each paragraph must be indented by 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm).\n\n\nIndent the first line by hitting to \u201cTab\u201d key on your keyboard.\nYou do not need to separate paragraphs with extra line spacing. This indentation alone is enough to mark the start of a new paragraph.\n\n, If your paper is long, your instructor may request that you separate certain portions of it into various section headings.\n\n\nThe recommendation for section headings under the MLA style is to number each section with an Arabic number and a period. Follow the period with a space before typing the section name.The first letter of each word in the section name should be capitalized.\nSection headings should usually be centered on the page and given their own separate lines.\n\n, When you include a table or figure in your MLA paper, center the figure and provide a figure number, label, and source information.\n\n\nUse \"Fig. 1,\" \"Fig. 2,\" etc. for illustrations and photographs. Use \"Table 1,\" \"Table 2,\" etc. for tables and charts.\nQuickly label the figure with a descriptive term like \"cartoon\" or \"statistical table.\"\nProvide the creator's name, the source the figure was published in, the date of publication, and the page number.\nAll of the information should be included on a single line below the picture.\n\n, Whenever you include a direct quote, paraphrase, or summary in your paper, you must cite the source of that material in parentheses after the material is presented.\n\n\nWhen the information is available, include the author's last name and the page number from which the material came.\nIf the materials came from an online source and no page number is available, you only need to include the author's name.\nIf no author's name is available, include an abbreviated portion of the source material's title.\nNote that if you introduce the author's name earlier in the sentence, you do not need to include the name in the parentheses, as well.\n\n, Most quotations will be \u201cin-line,\u201d meaning that no special formatting is required and they can be treated as normal text.\n\n\nAlways include a quote as part of another sentence. Never write a \u201changing quote,\u201d a type of quotation in which only the quote is presented without any lead in.\nCommas and periods should follow the parenthetical citation, and the parentheses should fall outside of the ending quotation marks.\n\n, Quotes that are longer than three lines should be separated from the rest of the text in the form of a block quote.After you type the last word that comes before your quote, hit the \"Enter\" key to move to a new line.\nEach line of a block quote should be indented another 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) in.\nYou do not need to include quotation marks for a block quote, but you still need to include a parenthetical citation.\n\n, Do not italicize, bold, or underline this heading.If you inserted any notes into your document, the notes themselves should be included as endnotes that are listed on a separate page after the main body of the paper. Do not include them as footnotes, which are listed at the foot of each page as they appear.\n\n, If you inserted your endnotes using an endnote tool on your word processor, the numbering should already be done for you.\n\n\nOtherwise, make sure that each endnote is proceeded by an Arabic number that corresponds to a number places in the section of the paper's body that relates to the information provided by the endnote.\nThe first line of each endnote should be indented by 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm).\n\n, Endnotes should be used to discuss information that does not coherently fit into the paragraph it relates to.\n\n\nYour endnotes should not exceed three or four lines in lengths. Avoid long discussions. Endnotes are not the right time to bring up entirely new points.\n\n, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.\n\n\nIf including multiple appendices, label each as \u201cAppendix A,\u201d \u201cAppendix B,\u201d and so on.\n\n, The information in an appendix should relate to the information in your paper, but it should not be crucial or essential to your argument.\n\n\nAn appendix is a way to include related information without distracting from the main argument of your paper.\n\n, Do not italicize, bold, or underline the heading.\n\n\nYour \u201cWorks Cited\u201d page should include all the texts you directly referenced in the body of your paper.\nAll papers written in MLA format must include a \u201cWorks Cited\u201d page.\n\n, All of your citations should be listed in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names.\n\n\nIf a text does not have a known author, arrange that citation in alphabetical order according to the first word of the article or book title.\n\n,\n\n\nWrite the author's name in LastName, Firstname\" format.

{"text":" Speak to your pastor about your interest in becoming ordained. If your pastor supports your goal, you will be brought before a local board at your church. This board or committee will ask you questions about your interest in becoming ordained.\n\n\nYou might be rejected if you express a mystical belief that God has chosen you to become ordained, if you suggest or imply that ordination would simply be a personal accomplishment, if you have few other professional options or have been unsuccessful in their professional life, or if you demonstrate an inadequate understanding about the purpose of ministry. You will also likely be rejected if you have a criminal history.\nTo be accepted as a candidate for ordination, express a willingness to serve the church and congregation, demonstrate that you are personable and have strong people skills, and show that you are willing to work hard.\nReport back to the board periodically about progress you\u2019ve made toward becoming ordained.\nBe completely honest with your church committee.\n\n, After passing the initial interview, the church might assign you a spiritual mentor -- an elder in the church or another person with strong faith -- to help guide you through the ordination process. If you are allowed to choose from a number of different potential mentors, select someone who you can communicate easily and honestly with who will keep you energized and focused throughout the ordination process., You will receive a Master of Divinity degree from a seminary accredited by the Association of Theological Schools. You could, alternately, obtain a Master of Arts in theology, though this is not preferred.\n\n\nYou do not need to attend a seminary explicitly associated with your denomination.\nIf you do not like your seminary, talk to your mentor and church committee about transferring to another seminary.\n\n, You will engage in part-time work to gain practical experience as part of the clergy. In addition to the internship, a shorter period of internship called a practicum may be required. Check your seminary\u2019s graduation requirements for specifics.\n\n, You will also need to undertake sex-abuse training to identify and understand sexual abuse. Use training materials provided by the seminary to prepare for these tests.\n\n\nYou might also be given psychological and personality tests.\n\n, You should also include some information about a specific topic or topics relevant to your ordination. For instance, you might write the main body of your ordination paper on a topic like \u201cforgiveness in the Old Testament.\u201d\n\n\nThe specific format of your ordination paper depends on the requirements of your seminary program.\n\n, Some denominations like the United Methodists and Evangelicals have a probationary period for their pastors. You might need to rack up four years or more of ministry experience before you are properly ordained.During this trial period, find your own voice at the pulpit and gain more experience in helping, preaching, and providing inspiration to your community of believers.\nContinue learning more about your role in the church and deepening your knowledge of the Bible through daily reading and reflection.\n\n, You will also need to present personal references, some or all of which are from other pastors, deacons, or church elders.

{"text":" A proper personal flotation device should be a jacket or vest that covers the chest, stomach and back. The life vest must be properly fitted so that it does not slip up on the body when falling.\n\n\nIt should fit snugly but not be uncomfortable.\nBe sure to check the manufacturer\u2019s label for weight limits and sizing information. ;\n, You will want a pair of combination skis, which are suitable for beginners and have two skis with one ski having a half-foot binding behind the other foot. Skis for beginners will usually be wider and thus more stable on the water. They will be made for different weight ranges so it is important to pick a water ski that suits your size.\n\n\nCheck the manufacturer recommendations for the recommended weight ranges for the particular skis you are looking at.\nKids skis are different in that they are smaller and easier for small children to control. They will usually come with a \u201ctrainer\u201d option, or when you tie the skies together to prevent the skier from losing their balance and performing the splits.\nThe bindings will usually be adjustable for a range of sizes to fit a variety of people., Trainer skis for kids can often be tied together, preventing the child from doing the \u201csplits\u201d. Kids usually have a hard time keeping control over their skis and keeping them together so this can be incredibly helpful when beginning.\n\n, A water skiing rope will have a little stretch only and be 75 feet (22.86 meters) long from the handle to the opposite end. Do not use a wakeboarding rope, which will have no stretch, or a rope that is too stretchy.\n\n\nThe rope should be labelled and marketed specifically for water skiing.\n\n, There are seven different hand signals that a skier should learn. These are important for signalling the boat driver while water skiing.\n\n\nA thumbs-up means go faster while a thumbs-down means slow down. It is important to remember this while skiing so that you do not accidentally ask for more speed.\nBring thumb and forefinger together to signal OK. This tells the driver that the speed and path are good.\nPoint your finger in the air and move it in a circular motion and then point to the direction when you want to turn a certain way. This can be used by the water skier to signal that they want to go a particular way or by the boat driver to warn the skier of a turn.\nPat your head to signal that you would like to return to the dock. You can do this if you are tired and want to finish.\nA slashing motion at the neck means to stop the boat immediately. This can be done by the skier, driver or observer in case of emergencies.\nClasp your hands over your head after a fall to signal that you are OK. This should be done after every fall., Many states require boats to have ski flags. These are usually bright coloured flags that signal to other boats that there is a skier in the water. Every time the skier is in the water and not skiing, the flag must be held up for other boats to see.\n\n\nThis is an important safety measure and most boats will need an observer who is in charge of watching the skier and holding the flag., The proper stance for starting to water ski is called the \u201ccannonball\u201d position.\n\n\nWhile on dry land, put the skis on your feet.\nHold the handle and bend your knees so that you are sitting on the skis in the same form you would use to complete a cannonball.\nHave someone pull gently on the other end of the rope to help pull you up into into a chair position. You will look like you are sitting in a chair, even though there is not one.\nMake sure your knees stay together at all times and that you keep your arms straight to allow the rope to pull you up., The most important aspect of pulling a water skier is to start quickly, or have a lot of torque. This means that you must have a relatively strong boat and that you start from zero very quickly. This will help the water skier to get up on their skis smoothly.\n\n, It is very important that the driver pull steadily to ensure a smooth ride for the water skier. If they change speeds or turn suddenly it can be very difficult for a beginning water skier to maintain balance.\n\n, Usually early morning works best when water skiing because that is when the water is at its calmest. Later in the day there may be more traffic and thus rougher waters.\n\n\nIf you do hit rough water or wakes, then you should hit them at a 90 degree angle to minimize the bumps for the water skier.\nIt is important to make water skiing fun for kids so try to pick a time which is suitable for everyone when teaching them.\n\n, Speeds will vary according to the size and experience level of the skier but there are general guidelines for water skiing. Kids should be pulled as slow as possible while keeping them out of the water. The speeds described here are for water skiing on two skis only.\n\n\nWater skiers who are less than 50 lbs. (<23 kg) should be pulled at about 13 mph (21 km\/h).\nWater skiers who are 50-100 lbs. (23-45 kg) should be pulled at about 16 mph (26 km\/h).\nWater skiers who are 100-150 lbs. (45-68 kg) should be pulled at about 18 mph (29 km\/h).\nWater skiers who are 150-180 lbs. (68-82 kg) should be pulled at about 21 mph (34 km\/h).\nWater skiers who are more than 180 lbs. (>82 kg) should be pulled at about 24 mph (38 km\/h).\nAdjust your speed on turns. If the skier is on the inside of a turn then they will slow down and you may need to speed up. If they are on the outside of the turn they may speed up and you may need to slow down., You can easily slingshot a water skier on a turn so it is important to make sure that you keep far enough away from any docks or obstacles. Additionally, if a skier lets go they can travel quite far before sinking into the water so keep this in mind.\n\n\nDo not go over any shallow water or where there may be obstructions just above or below the surface of the water.\nMost ski accidents occur from collisions with docks or other solid objects so be very careful about staying in open water., You should usually have an observer on the boat to help you watch the skier in case they fall or are signalling the boat. It will be difficult for the driver to watch where they are going and keep an eye on the skier at the same time.\n\n\nThe observer will be the one controlling the ski flag and relaying signals to the driver.\n\n, It is always good practice and safer to turn off the propeller completely when near anyone in the water. As soon as you get close, turn off the propeller and let your momentum bring the boat alongside them.\n\n\nBe very careful not to injure the skier when bringing the boat near. Do not come too close and always turn off the propeller.\n\n, An EZ ski trainer helps kids get used to being pulled behind a boat before trying to get them up on water skis. This device is like an inflatable jet ski that will be pulled behind a boat on a rope. It also helps kids build confidence, learn how to hold the hand and maintain balance.\n\n\nThe kids can sit or stand as they feel comfortable, learning how to balance and getting accustomed to being pulled behind a boat.\nBe patient with kids and allow them to go at their own pace. This trainer can help reduce some of their nervousness before water skiing., Sit on the side of the boat or at the dock and put the water skis on. They should be adjusted for your correct size and you will usually simply have to slip your feet inside to secure them. The foot should be tight so it may take a little wiggling to get your feet in all the way.\n\n\nIt can help to wet the skis before putting them on, because it makes them easier to slide on your feet.\nKids may need assistance with getting their skis on properly so help them when necessary.\n\n, Hold the rope with your two hands next to each other. Both palms should be facing down for water skiing on two skis. Make sure your grip is secure and your arms stick straight out in front of you., Allow your personal flotation device or lifejacket to keep you on top of the water and lean back. Bring your knees to your chest, with your arms around the outsides of your knees as if you are hugging them.\n\n\nBring the rope in between the tips of your skis with the handle between your body and the ski tips.\n\n, While leaning back with your knees to your chest, bring your ski tips up out of the water, keeping your skis straight and close together. Water skis should be no more than hip width apart.\n\n\nKids skis will often have a rope or other device holding them together. This helps keep their skis together to maintain control.\n\n, With the rope between your skis and your hands holding the handle securely between your body and the ski tips, keep your arms straight in front of you. This is a very important aspect of getting up on water skis.\n\n\nIt is very important to let the boat pull you out of the water and up onto your skis.\nIf you try to bend your arms or pull yourself up out of the water, you will likely lose your balance and fall.\n\n, If you are close to shore, someone can hold the water skier in their arms, keeping their skis together and helping them to balance while leaning back with their knees to their chest.\n\n\nThis can be especially helpful for children, who may lose their balance or form while waiting for the boat to go.\n\n, There cannot be any slack in the rope with the boat starts going or else it will jerk the water skier forward and cause them to lose their balance. Once the rope is in the water skier\u2019s hands the boat can move forward at a slow pace until the rope is tight.\n\n\nThe water skier may move slightly forward through the water while the rope is being tightened. Be careful to stay balanced and maintain your form.\n\n, Yell \u201chit it!\u201d to the driver to signal that you are ready to begin. The boat will start quickly forward. Keep your form together and stay calm and confidence. Being confident and relaxed is very important for getting up easily on water skis.\n\n\nIt is more important that the boat has a lot of torque, or picks up speed quickly, rather than that it achieves a high speed., Keep your \u2018cannonball\u2019 form while leaning back slightly with your arms straight in front of you as you allow the boat to pull you up. The skis should be directly underneath you even though you are leaning back slightly. Do not stand up immediately.\n\n\nBending your arms to pull yourself up will only cause you to lose your balance so keep them straight.\nKeep your eyes directly ahead. Putting your eyes and head up to avoid splash can make you lose your balance while looking down will likely cause you to fall down.\n\n, Having your knees bent is imperative both before the boat starts and while you are trying to get up on skis. This will help you to maintain balance properly and better control your skis.\n\n\nEven if the water is quite smooth, there will always be small bumps so keeping your knees bent will help to absorb those bumps.\n\n, If you are comfortable being pulled and are balanced, try standing up. While standing keep your feet and skis directly beneath you and simply straighten out your legs while continuing to lean back slightly with your arms directly in front of you.\n\n\nIt might be best for kids to try skiing once or twice while remaining in the \u2018cannonball\u2019 form the entire time. This helps them to get used to water skiing and maintaining balance and control.\n\n, It can be tricky to keep your balance while learning how to water ski. Be patient with yourself and keep your confidence. If you are getting frustrated you can give yourself a break and try again later.\n\n\nCovering your face with your hands when you float back up to the surface can help prevent you from getting banged in the face by the ski if it falls off.\nHold up your arm or a water ski while the boat and turning to come back to you so that other boaters can see you and avoid you.\n\n, Bending your knees will help you to absorb any bumps or wakes that the boat traverses, helping you maintain balance and continue standing.\n\n, Do not try to pull yourself forward or maintain balance by pulling on the rope. You should simply allow the rope to continue pulling you forward.\n\n, Lean back slightly with your hips forming a straight line with your shoulders. You can push your hips slightly forward and up towards the handle but make sure the skis stay directly beneath you.\n\n\nAllowing the skis to move to far out in front of you will cause you to fall backwards.\nLeaning forward will cause the skis to move behind you and make you fall forward. , Many skiers tend to hold their breaths while skiing but it is important to breathe naturally. Normal breathing will reduce fatigue and prevent you from getting overly tired.\n\n, Try turning slightly by putting more pressure on the inside edge of the ski on the opposite side of where you want to go. Stay inside the wake for now.\n\n\nFor example, you will push down on the inside edge of the ski with your left leg and lean slightly to the right and away from the boat to move to the right. At the same time you can lift up slightly with your right foot to help you turn.\nMake sure you keep proper positioning with your knees bent and arms straight in front of you while you turn., Make a turn to either side and cross the wakes by turning your skis at a sharp angle to the wake. Keep pressure on your ski closest to the boat until you are completely outside the wake.\n\n\nKeep your knees bent to absorb the shock.\nIf you try to cross with one ski at a time, you will fall. Make sure you cross at a sharp angle to the wake with both skis at the same time.\nGoing over the wake should be quite quick. If you try to go slowly, you will fall.\nKeep your arms straight in front of you while crossing the wake.

You may want to devote a day to browsing vintage racks.;\n, They create similar looks; however dresses can run between $65 and $150.\n\n\nMost of these stores don\u2019t have physical locations, so you will need to shop online.\n\n, Lucy often wore patterns that popped in black and white. Ensure it has a full swing skirt., Both should be form fitting. The gingham shirt can be tied at the natural waist.\n\n, Sling back or patent flats can also work.\n\n, Chiffon fabric is the most comfortable, and you will need to measure it to the length of the dress. Lucy favored knee or just over the knee-length dresses.\n\n, Although I Love Lucy was in black and white, she was well known for her red hair. She was likely to have been a natural brunette, but the red hair matched her trademark lipstick and outfits.\n\n, Section the top of your head in a rectangular part along the sides and back. This will be the bouffant-like section.\n\n\nIt is recommended that your bangs be at least three to four inches long to pull off the pin curl look.\nTie up the rest of your hair so that it doesn\u2019t get in the way.\n\n, Twist one-inch (2.5cm) sections onto your head and pin them in place along each row. You should have three to four pin curls in each of the three front rows.\n\n\nSecure with two bobby pins placed like cross hairs. Try to make each of the bobby pin pairs identical on each pin curl.\n\n, Pin curl a bottom row going clockwise. Pin curl a top row going counterclockwise.\n\n, Cover the pin curls with a scarf. Sleep on them and wait until you are getting ready the next day to take them out.\n\n, This way it will be out of your face.\n\n, Take down the sides first, one at a time.\n\n, Wrap them up into the bun and pin them in place, leaving a wave at the side. Repeat on the opposite side.\n\n, Comb through the curls gently with your fingers, leaving them mostly intact.\n\n, Roll them so there is a ringlet in front. Pin them in place, taking care to hide the pins.\n\n, The curls should come out slightly over your forehead., If you are going for the full black and white star look, remember that she wore heavy makeup to get a flawless complexion. If you are going casual, this is not necessary.\n\n, Use a brow pencil to accentuate the arches. Lucy had fairly heavy, distinct brows.\n\n, You can also use fake lashes to get a more dramatic look.\n\n,, Lucy arched her lips slightly bigger at the top and bottom, between the creases.\n\n, Fill the lips in with matching red lipstick. Powder the lips slightly to set them., Have someone help you into your dress at this point, so that it stays free from powder and hairspray.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":870}

Make sure you stretch your legs very well because you'll use them the most. Don't forget the arms, they're important too!\n\n, Shuffle backwards and forwards using small steps to get in the right frame of mind.\n\n, There are a few different positions but the most important thing is to be comfortable in how you're standing.

{"text":"\n\n\nHold the thick end of the cue in your dominant hand with your palm facing upward. Find the spot on the wrap where the cue evenly balances. Grip your cue about 1\" behind that spot.\nMake a circle with the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand. Put the cue through the circle and rest it on the top of your middle finger, behind the knuckle. Spread out your \"pinky\", ring and middle finger tips to create a tripod-like support.\nPlace the ridge of your hand should on the table. Lift the other side of your hand a bit higher.;\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlace the foot that is on the same side as your non-dominant hand in front.\nPosition your other foot about 2 feet (60 cm) behind the front foot.\nTurn your body slightly away from the table so that it doesn't interfere with the shot.\nPosition yourself close to the table but not too close to the table. You want to lean into the shots a bit for more control.\nProper form requires the cue stick to be directly below your chin during a stroke. If you compare the form of a professional pool player with that of a novice pool player, the professional player will always keep their head down also known as \"being down on the ball\" with the cue directly below his or her chin during the stroke.\n\n, Avoid twisting the chalk on top of the cue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,, Imagine that you are moving your arm through the water in a swimming pool instead of hitting the ball with a quick strike. A longer stroke imparts more momentum to the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The cue should continue on its course and almost hit the table ahead of the ball's starting position. Your cue shouldn't slow down until the tip has actually hit the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This position allows you to analyze the angle of the ball and the direction of every other ball that it strikes. It also ensures that you don't cause the shot to deviate by accidentally introducing a jumpy motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,,, Angle the cue so that it creates a parallel line from right above the cue ball to the target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Maintain the angle that you just made when you lined up the ball and the pocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Pull the rest of the cue around to the right or left until the cue is positioned over the white ball. You now have the angle at which you need to hit the white ball to sink the other ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Strike the center of the white ball so that it makes contact with the other ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, It will make you less likely to win the current game but more likely to win future games. Sometimes in pool, you get a shot that would be an awkward angle with your dominant hand, but your non-dominant hand will gain skill faster for those awkward shots if you play with your non-dominant hand all the time than if you just do it for those shots. In fact, skill transfers somewhat from one task to another task to your non-dominant hand will gain skill for pool faster if you you do everything with your non-dominant hand than if you just play pool with your non-dominant hand like in other activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a larger wrap if you have large hands and a smaller wrap if you have small hands. The most important point is to find a wrap that feels good in your hands.\nIf your hands sweat, choose a cue wrapped in Irish linen for absorption. Otherwise, choose a leather wrap or a cue with no wrap.\n\n, Most shafts have a diameter of 12mm to 13mm. While 13mm is the most commonly selected size, a smaller shaft can make the bridge position more comfortable for people with smaller hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, The shaft maintains its diameter for 10\" to 15\" before it starts to taper toward the cue. A shorter taper gives you a firmer hit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Most players choose a weight between 19 and 20 ounces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Most cues are 57\" or 58\" long, but you can special order different lengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Cue tips are made of leather and generally rated medium to hard. A tip that will wear well gives you better control of the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Any loose parts will absorb the energy from your shots and will hamper your ability to strike the ball well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":873}
{"text":", If your horse has this but makes it past the first 14 days since infection he should be okay.\nChronic: Chronic EIA horses go through the same severity of acute EIA horses but seem to recover after a few weeks. The symptoms then go away for weeks or even months until the horse has a relapse of worsened intensity, usually as result of being worked hard. Chronic EIA horses also can have rough hair coats, lack stamina, and be anemic.\nCarrier: Carriers of the EIA virus will seem to completely recover from the initial attack, yet still carry and can transmit the disease., A healthy adult horse's temperature while resting varies from to 99-101\u00b0F (37.2 - 38.3\u00b0C), while fever associated with EIA can range from 105-108\u00b0F (40.5 - 42.2\u00b0C).\n\n\nThe fever of an EIA-infected horse can either be highly intermittent or continuous. It may help to take your horse's temperature several times throughout the day.;\n, This can be checked by placing the hand under the horse's left elbow. Count the beats for 10 seconds then multiply the beats by 6 to get the heartbeat number per minute. A normal heart rate is 35-40 beats per minute.\n\n\nIrregularity may be a sign of infection with EIA.\n\n, A healthy horse likes his food and while eat it nearly as soon as you offer it. A horse that refuses food or has a reduced appetite, however, may have EIA.\n\n, Don't be concerned unless there has been no change of diet and your horse has had rapid or chronic weight loss.\n\n, Tiredness and depression are also signs of EIA.\n\n, Swelling is another sign of the horse having EIA.\n\n, Similar diseases include Piroplasmosis, African Horse Sickness, Anthrax, Dourine, Equine Viral Arteritis, Japanese Encephalitis, Equine Influenza, Equine Herpes Virus, and Babesiosis.\n\n, He should be able to give you advice and confirm your horse's symptoms.\n\n, This test is fairly inexpensive and only requires a certified vet sending a sample of your horse's blood to a lab. Usually the process takes 3-5 days.\n\n\nA negative Coggins\/EIA test result means your horse is not a carrier of the disease. If your horse continues having symptoms, tell your vet; your horse may be sick with something else.\nA positive Coggins\/EIA test result means your horse is an EIA carrier. If you feel the test was a false positive you can ask your vet to retake the Coggins, though you will need to pay for the test again.\n\n,, This will reduce the potential of EIA spreading throughout the area.\n\n\nSome areas say area of exposure is within proximity of 200 yards (180 meters) of the infected horse, other areas say within proximity of 3 miles (4.8 kilometers).\n\n, Legally you only have three choices: Keeping your horse at a quarantine facility for the rest of its life, having the horse euthanized, or selling the horse for immediate slaughter.\n\n\nThere aren't many quarantine facilities, but one of the largest ones, Florida Research Institute for Equine Nurturing, Development and Safety, is located in Southern Florida.\n\n, Large-mouthed flies such as deer-flies and horseflies will quickly spread the EIA virus by mechanically sharing an infected horse's blood with other horses.\n\n\nRegularly clean and muck stalls\/pens around the barn, depositing the manure a good distance away.\nEliminate any standing water; flies use these as breeding grounds.\nUse fly-repelling sprays and fly traps around the barn.\n\n, Infected mouth germs will share the EIA disease just like blood.\n\n, This will prevent an infected horse's blood from getting into other horses.\n\n, While this is a good practice anyway, the threat of EIA makes it an even better one.\n\n, While diseases can definitely be fatal, a horse is much less prone to becoming sick if he's happy and well cared for.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":874}
{"text":" Does your family come before or after your faith in god, if you believe in god? Is it more important for you to spend time on the hobbies that make you personally happy, or to focus on the career that supports your family and gives them a comfortable life?\n\n\nBy ranking your values and priorities, you\u2019ll be better able to tell whether or not you\u2019re devoting an appropriate amount of energy to each aspect of your life.;\n, There are no right or wrong answers, but be honest. Maybe traveling brings you the most joy, or maybe it\u2019s a well-cooked meal. Maybe you love talk about books, and you should practice literary criticism. Maybe you like to be the one writing the books, not the one talking about the books other people have written.\n\n\nThe list might evolve over time. What makes you happy at twenty might not be what makes you happy at thirty. Don\u2019t be married to an image of \u201cwho you are\u201d \u2014 update your list over time to reflect what makes you happy in the present moment.\n\n, Having \u201cstuff\u201d makes a lot of people happy, but don\u2019t fool yourself into thinking that just having things is the root of joy. You may want a nice sound system because you love music, but focus on your love of music, not the sound system.Be aware that going to concerts, singing with friends, and whistling on your drive to work are all equally important elements that work with the fancy sound system to bring you joy.\n\n, Meditation can be incredibly beneficial for mental health and happiness, and can clear your mind so you can see your priorities more clearlyAlthough it has religious and mystical roots, meditative techniques can be used by anyone for relaxation and stress relief.\n\n\nFind a tranquil environment free from distracting sounds and activities \u2014 someplace where you can clear your mind and focus on your state of being.\nSit in a comfortable position like the lotus position with your eyes closed, and focus on your breathing.\nInhale and exhale slowly, deeply, and purposefully.\nFocus on your breath, how it feels entering and exiting your body. Be present fully in your body in the moment, and do your best to think of nothing else.\nDo this at the same time every day to make it part of your routine. Early in the morning, before you go to work, is a good time for meditation because it calms and prepares you for the rest of your day.\n\n, If you\u2019re a great public speaker, and you really enjoy giving presentations, you\u2019re wasting your talents away coding programs at a desk. Maybe you should be a teacher instead!\n\n\nAre you a good speaker?\nDo you work best alone or in teams?\nDo you work best when you\u2019re given tasks, or when you have to lead your own projects?\n\n, Although not everybody can have a career in something they\u2019re absolutely crazy about, most people should be able to match up interests and careers to some degree.\n\n\nThere are many tests you can take to figure out what kinds of jobs are best matched up with your interests., Some people can\u2019t stand the idea of working every day from 9-5 in an office setting. If you need the flexibility to work at your own pace, during your own work hours, from a setting of your choosing, maybe you need to find freelance or contract work. Other people could not imagine the constantly shifting schedule of a university professor, for example, and crave the stability and ritual of a 9-5 workday and Monday to Friday workweek.\n\n\nAsk yourself what kind of schedule would work best with your work habits.\nDon\u2019t choose freelance work if you slack off and lose focus easily!\nNote that freelance and contract work is less stable than regular office work, and usually does not offer benefits.\n\n, Although you shouldn\u2019t ever choose a career just for the money, you also don\u2019t want to labor away without ever making enough money to support yourself and your family. Calculate a budget for how much money you\u2019ll need to maintain your family at a level of comfort that\u2019s acceptable.\n\n\nSearch online for average salaries in various career paths.Figure out if the career you\u2019re thinking about will work with your budget.\n\n, You need to put everything on the backburner except for your career satisfaction.\n\n\nTo prepare for a career change, you should begin saving as much money as possible. A career change sometimes means you have to start your new job at a lower-paying position before you can work your way back up the ladder.\n\n, What are your most uncompromising, unchanging beliefs? Some examples might be:\n\n\nYou want a big family vs. you don\u2019t want kids\nReligious beliefs\nFeelings about marriage and\/or divorce\n\n, Prioritize the things you\u2019re looking for in a relationship and figure out what the five most important elements are. Some examples might be:\n\n\nSense of humor\nGood-looking\nShares your taste in music or other hobbies\nEnjoys\/avoids outdoor activities\nFinancial stability\n\n, Regardless of how great a romantic partner you find, you\u2019ll never be happy in a relationship until you can be happy with yourself.You\u2019ll also have a better idea of what you want and need in a partner if you\u2019re the best version of yourself that you can possibly be, and you\u2019re happy with it.\n\n, Admit that you\u2019re never going to find someone who meets your entire checklist, and just be open to spending time with the people you feel a connection with.\n\n, Some people know from a young age that they want to be parents, but it\u2019s not so obvious an option for many. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! Don\u2019t let anyone \u2014 parents, friends, society at large \u2014 pressure you into a choice you don\u2019t want for yourself. Some things to keep in mind include:\n\n\nAre you called to parenthood? Though it\u2019s more commonly ascribed to women (biological clocks, maternal instincts), both men and women sometimes just feel the urge to start a family. Other times, that need simply isn\u2019t there.\nCan you afford a family? As of 2014, the estimated cost of raising a child from birth to legal adulthood is $245,000.How much wiggle room will that give you, based on your family income? Will you be able to give children a good quality of life? Will you have a comfortable retirement?\nDo you understand the realities of parenting? Although most all parents will say that their children are their greatest joy and achievement, they\u2019ll also tell you how hard it is to raise a child. As a parent, it will be your responsibility to safeguard your child against all dangers, to provide them with the best possible life, and to socialize them into a responsible citizen of the world. You\u2019ll have to put up with temper tantrums and expensive Christmas lists, etc., etc. It\u2019s a hard job!\nRemember that women can always have their eggs frozen if they choose not to have children in prime child-bearing age.Although it\u2019s difficult to get pregnant as women\u2019s bodies age, freezing young eggs gives you a better chance at having a child if you choose to start a family later in life.\n\n, If you decide that you do, in fact, want to have children, the next step is to figure out how large you want your family to grow. Again, some of this is just instinct; some people can just feel in their bones that they want a large family. But there are many practical considerations you should keep in mind.\n\n\nAgain, each child will cost about $245,000 over their 18 years of legal childhood!\nHow much attention can you devote to each child? A single child will get as much attention as their parents have to offer, but with each additional child, your attention will grow more and more diffused over your growing brood. How much time will you have to drive each child to their individual after-school activities, help with homework, listen to them talk about their days, etc.?\nHow much companionship do you want your child to have? Even if you can\u2019t devote undivided parental attention to a child, having many siblings means your children will always have playmates to keep them occupied and to help each other through the trying emotional times when they don\u2019t always turn to their parents.\nRemember that with your third child, you are officially outnumbered. With two children, one parent can manage each in a given situation, but with three children, there\u2019s a spare child running loose!\n\n, Though traditional gender roles see a man in the workplace and a woman raising the children at home, these days, both men and women should feel equally comfortable in either role.\n\n\nChildcare for children whose parents work can be so expensive, depending on where you live, that it may not be worth the income from your job.Would be comfortable with other people spending that much time raising your children, regardless of how much you trust them?\nDo you want to be present for all of your child\u2019s developmental milestones, and would working in an office get in the way of that?\nWould staying at home with your child all day make you feel claustrophobic, or like you\u2019re being defined solely by your identity as a parent?\nWould staying at home keep you from the passions and interests you get to explore every day at a job you love?\n\n, Despite what a legion of parenting books would have you think, there\u2019s no right or wrong way to be a parent. After all, people raised children for centuries without guidebooks. It is important, though, to think about what kind of parent you want to be to be as happy as possible.\n\n\nDo you want to be a hands-on parent who walks their children through all of their decisions and activities, or do you want to be a more laissez-faire parent who lets their children make and learn from their own mistakes?\nHow involved do you want to be in their education? Will you check homework every night? Assign extra homework outside of class? Or let more qualified teachers handle their education?\nHow do you want to reprimand your children when they make mistakes? Would you feel more comfortable in a good cop or bad cop role? Another way to think of it might be \u201cdo you want to be more of a coach who helps make good decisions, or a referee who identifies and punishes mistakes?\u201d\nDo you put your children first before all others, or does your marriage take priority? What about your personal happiness?\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":875}

Controller classes include Druids, Invokers, and Wizards.\nDefenders are front-line combatants and have high defense. Defender classes include Fighters, Paladins, and Wardens.\nLeaders have healing and aiding abilities to protect the rest of the party as their roll, and also boast high defense. Leader classes include Bards, Clerics, Shamans, and Warlords.\nStrikers deal massive damage to single enemies at a time and have the highest attack and mobility of the party. Striker classes include Avengers, Barbarians, Rangers, Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks.\n\n, You should consult their descriptions in the source books in making this decision.\n\n\nThe PHB contains information on the classes Cleric, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warlock, Warlord, and Wizard.\nThe PHB2 contains information on the classes Avenger, Barbarian, Bard, Druid, Invoker, Shaman, Sorcerer, and Warden.\nThe PHB3 contains information on the classes Ardent, Battlemind, Monk, Psion, Runepriest, and Seeker.\n\n, Also create a vertical column with six lines title stats. At the beginning of each line, write down the following: Strength (Str), Constitution (Con), Dexterity (Dex), Intelligence (Int), Wisdom (Wis), and Charisma (Cha). These make up the six ability scores of your character. ]]\n\n\nStrength represents physical power.\nConstitution represents health and stamina.\nDexterity represents agility and reflexes.\nIntelligence represents reasoning.\nWisdom represents common sense.\nCharisma represents personality.\n\n, Ability scores are the base statistics for your character and can be determined with one of three methods. Note that each class depends on certain ability scores, which typically means that you should assign higher scores to these abilities.\n\n\nThe first method uses a standard array of scores. Assign the following numbers to each ability score any way you like: 16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10.\nThe second method is a little more complicated. Start with the following scores: 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10. You have 22 \"points\" to spend in order to increase the ability scores. Use the following rules to spend these points and improve your ability scores, then assign the score to the specific abilities.\n\nImproving the numbers 8-12 costs one point. As such, increasing the \"8\" to a \"12\" would cost 4 points. Improving a \"10\" to a \"13\" would cost only 3: one point each for 10-to-11, 11-to-12, and 12-to-13.\nImproving the numbers 13-15 costs two points. As such, increasing the \"12\" from before would cost another point to become a \"13\", but an additional two points to improve to a \"14\". Similarly, improving the \"13\" to a \"16\" would cost 6 points: two each for 13-to-14, 14-to-15, and 15-to-16.\nImproving a \"16\" to a \"17\" costs another three points.\nImproving a \"17\" to an \"18\" costs another four points. As a result, upgrading a \"10\" to an \"18\" would cost a total of 16 points = 3*1 + 3*2 + 3 + 4.\n\n\nThe third method uses randomly-generated numbers and provides the most versatile and volatile scores. For each ability score, roll 4 6-sided dice (4d6). Add the three highest numbers, ignore the lowest, and assign the sum as an ability score.\n\n,\n\n\nAdd or subtract these from the base stats. Once the base stats have been assigned after racial adjustments, assign each score an ability modifier, with either a plus or minus sign next to the base stat followed by the number. The table shows the ability modifiers:\n\nAd infinitum. At first level, 8 should be the lowest ability score and 18 the highest. Average scores are considered between 12-16.\n\n\n\n, In the PHB, a list of skills to choose from can be found in chapter five. First, go to your classes' entry in the PHB in chapter four.\n\n, These skills are the skills you are trained in, and each get a permanent +5 bonus.\n\n, They can be found on page 178 of the PHB.\n\n, Next to each skill ability, write down the skill points you currently have. Each skill point is equal to one-half of your level plus your ability score modifier and +5 if you are trained in that skill.\n\n\nAs an example, say you are playing a 1st-level human rogue with the following ability scores:\n\nstr 11 +0\ncon 10 +0\ndex 16 +3\nint 12 +1\nwis 8 -1\ncha 14 +2\n\nA rogue is automatically trained in Thievery and Stealth, meaning he or she gets an automatic +5 points for both of those skills. They can also choose four of the following skills to be trained in:\n\nAcrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Dungeoneering, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, and Streetwise.\nAs an example, Acrobatics, Bluff, Perception, and Streetwise were chosen to be trained skills. This means that the rogue currently has six skills he or she is trained in and has a permanent +5 bonus to. Since Acrobatics is a dexterity-based skill, the dexterity modifier of the rogue is added to the score, which is +3 in this case. Acrobatics is now equal to 8 total skill points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n,, At first level, you may choose one feat from chapter six. If you are human, you gain an additional feat. Feats provide static bonuses to characters, and bonuses of the same type do not stack together.\n\n, If you do, you may choose the feat If you don't, you must wait until you meet the prerequisite.\n\n, Powers are different kinds of attack your character can make and are divided into four categories: At-Will, Encounter, Daily, and Utility powers. \"At-Will\" powers can be used once per turn in an encounter indefinitely. \"Encounter\" powers can be used once per combat encounter. \"Daily\" powers can be used once per day.\n\n\nUtility powers act like feats in that they give you static bonuses and certain advantages.\nEach class in both the PHB and PHB2 list their powers in the same chapter. However, additional 4th edition d&d books are available for an extended list of available powers. The Martial Power handbook provides more\n\n, The Arcane Power handbook provides more powers for arcane characters. The Primal Power handbook provides more powers for primal characters. The Martial Power Handbook provides more power to martial characters.\n\n\nAt first level, each player can choose 2 at-wills, 1 encounter, and 1 daily powers. You can choose 1 utility power at second level.\n\n, At first level, you start with 100 gold pieces(gp) to spend on equipment. Chapter in the PHB provides you with a list of equipment to choose from. Purchase armor and weapons first, and then basic adventuring supplies. It's up to the party who carries what, unless you purchased all of your equipment on your own. Once these things are purchased, if you have any money left over you can choose to spend it on magic items, also found in chapter 7 in the PHB. The Adventurer's Vault Handbook provides an extension of supplies you can choose from as well.\n\n, It is highly recommended you use a character sheet to record your player info, but it is not necessary. Regular paper can work as well.\n\n,,,\n\n\nLawful Good means you follow the rules and do good.\nGood means you do good, but does not necessarily mean you follow rules.\nChaotic Evil is ultimate evil. You can do anything you want if it is evil.\nEvil means that you do evil, but you should follow rules.\n\n, Initiative determines who goes in what order in a combat. Your initiative bonus is equal to one-half your level plus your dexterity modifier, and any bonuses or penalties that apply from armor or feats.\n\n, Each of these defenses are equal to 10 plus one-half of your level plus the appropriate ability modifier. For armor class, add your armor bonus if any, and if you wear light armor add either your dex or int modifier, whichever of the two is higher. Fortitude uses the Str or Con modifier, Reflex uses the Dex or Int modifier, and Will uses the Wis or Cha modifier, whichever of the two is higher. If your class or race has any bonuses to these defenses, add them.\n\n, Speed is determined by your character's race.\n\n,, Passive perception and passive insight are the two most common passive senses. You have +10 in passive perception and passive insight at first level.\n\n, Attack bonuses are equal to one-half your level plus your attack's ability score modifier plus any class bonuses plus any proficiencies with a weapon plus any feats plus any weapon enhancements. An attack bonus, also known as a to-hit bonus, is added onto a d20 roll whenever you make a specific attack.\n\n, Your hit points are determined by your class. Your bloodied value is equal to half of your hit points. Your healing surges per day are determined by your class. Your healing surge value is equal to one-fourth of your total hit points.\n\n,,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":876}
{"text":" This all seems a little too logical, but you need to get these down in permanent ink in order to know what's the best size of venue, the right budget, the nature of presentations, amount (or type) of guests, and what strategies to employ for your specific event. So what's your ideal outcome? What do you want to get done?\n\n\nOnce you figure out what you're doing (celebrating, fundraising, educating, selling, proposing, etc.), think about why you're doing it. Knowing your motivations can help give you focus and drive.\nHaving a few objectives can also help align you in the direction you need to be going. You can't keep trying to reach a goal that hasn't been set! When you have $4,000 and you're aiming for $5,000, that goal can push you through to the finish line.;\n, This is one of the most important factors in your event planning. Pick a date and time no one can make and it doesn't even matter how great an event you have planned. And pick a date and time that's too far into the future -- or coming up too soon -- and your guests will either forget about it or already have plans. The Goldilocks syndrome of event managing!\n\n\nIdeally, you want to let your guests know about two weeks out. That gives them a good amount of time to not yet have plans and a good timeline for inviting them and reminding them once or twice before the time actually comes. So have your event be a few weeks into the future minimum, if you can swing it.\n\n, Now that you have an idea of what you're doing and when you're doing it, you can start thinking about venues and approaching potential ones with a date and things you'll need. What kind of building do you want to host in and how will the space be managed? Are the guests to be sitting on chairs in rows, on benches or at tables, or on picnic rugs in the open? Will the weather pose a problem? Will there need to be room for dancing, speakers podium or a stage? If so, plan to ensure the event space is large enough.\n\n\nIt is always best to visit the site in advance and draw yourself a map of the area. This map can be used as a \"battle plan\" and allows you to sketch and allocate table space, service routes for food service, disabled access if required and exit routes, as well as how you will get the equipment into place. You should also mark where the power generator (if required), external equipment such a refrigerator, ice maker, barbecue or stoves (etc.) will be, as well as where power points and cables will be (which may be covered discreetly with a rug) and other safety hazards to address.\nAre legal and local government approvals required? In most instances approvals are required for a bar, but also for excessive noise, vehicle access and parking, building large enclosures such as a pavilion and other needs.\n\n, How many people can your budget and venue handle? Some events are strictly ticket entry or invitation only, so it is easier to plan, but many events will have latecomers, or extras such as children, partners or friends. And keep in mind that the more guests you have, the more crew you need, too.\n\n\nAs it can be the biggest logistical problem it's always wise to ensure there adequate room for all people to move around at the site.\nIn older establishments, they usually call the quantity of guests \"pax,\" so if working in a function centre and you see \"Pax 150\" it means 150 guests are expected.\n\n, Hopefully you have a few people you can lean on to gauge together how much money you'll need for this event. Are you paying any staff? Renting equipment and your venue? Supplying food and drinks? Publishing pamphlets or postcards? Settle on a number that seems doable and cater your plan to it. You don't want to wind up paying out of your own pockets for this if you don't have to.\n\n\nYou may be in a situation where you can get sponsorships or donations, but most of us aren't so lucky. If you don't foresee any more funds coming in, it's imperative that you cut corners when need be. Instead of having a catering team, form a BYO or a \"bring-a-plate\" function (catering is minimal, but you will need to provide a food table, bain maries and refrigerators). Instead of hiring a photographer, go around and take photos yourself. Get creative where need be!\n\n, Organize your service team (even if they are friends and relatives or other volunteers) to handle different, relevant sections, even if you're not professionally running an event, but running a small family event. Good event management in a big scale is about organizing people to be in charge of individual areas of the event and making sure everyone knows what the plan is.\n\n\nYour crew needs just as much advanced noticed as the teams you're hiring and your guests. Assign them duties as soon as possible, giving them preference if you can. And try to have a few people on standby -- there are always a few flakes in every bunch.\n\n, No more planning can happen until know just what's going to happen at your event. When are the speakers speaking? Are there games, activities, or presentations that should be scheduled? How much time will the guests need to eat? Work out a fairly detailed timeline for the day's activities.\n\n\nAlways leave a little wiggle room; no event will be exactly as you planned, down to the minute. People run late, speeches take longer than expected, the line for the buffet doesn't shuffle along, you name it. So while you need a good idea of what's happening, understand that it's for organizational purposes and nothing is written in stone.\n\n, Because how else will people know to come?! You gotta send them invites! And this isn't something you should scrimp on, either. Your invitation is the face of your event. The first impression people get of what to expect and if they should even come. It's gotta be good.\n\n\nConsider your typical invitations -- postcards, flyers, etc. But also go paperless: email, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, and sites like Eventbrite that serve as invitations, guest trackers, and a calendar.\n\nCorrection: if you're trying to get as many people to come as possible, definitely use Facebook and Twitter. If you're trying to keep it to VIPs only, avoid these platforms. That's just asking for trouble.\n\n\n\n, You'll need a headcount to know just how much and what you all need, so keep track! It probably won't be the number that actually show up, but it should give you a general idea. Websites designed for event managing can help you do this -- but so can Facebook and an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n, Will you need to find, hire, book or delegate photographers, builders, designers and decorators, guest speakers, sponsors, entertainers or bands, officiates or clergy, dancing partners or demonstrations? It is wise to include them in catering and seating calculations so that a meal and a table place is provided for them if appropriate or required, too.\n\n\nAre food and beverages provided? If so, know who will be on the team to look after the cooking, serving and cleaning. What type of food do you need to serve? Are there likely to be guests with allergies, vegetarian or vegan needs, diabetics, religious needs such as halal or kosher, gluten-free, (etc)? And will there be infants, young children or the aged or injured who cannot eat solid foods?\nAre entertainment and logistics organised? This part might be delivery of music equipment, pavilions or tents and decorative effects or stage management you will need, such as a microphone and amplifiers, lighting, power outlets, projectors and screens for slideshows, smoke machines or other stage magic effects such as mirrors, banners and corporate signage, etc.\n\nIf you subcontract a company to be entertainers, consult with them to ensure they are able to supply and set-up their own equipment as well as where the stage and service sections will be on the site and what the schedule will be. This way you can find out what you may need to do to assist them.\n\n\nCaterers, florists, entertainers and other important people appreciate as much time as possible to plan, as it is typically more expensive to obtain goods and staff for high urgency requests. The other advantage is should they not be able to keep your appointment, you have some time still to find an alternative.\n\n, The MC doesn't always organise the event entirely, but they do host the event. It is usually a member of the party, who will organise speeches, announce events such as the meal courses, dancing, notable guests or entertainment. Liaise with this person often and keep them up-to-date. If they're any good, they'll be very helpful.\n\n\nSometimes you may have to be the MC, in which case the job becomes much harder as you will need to keep working until it's all over. It then becomes important to set up your service team with their own group leaders so you can delegate most of the normal duties to them.\n\n, When you hire a team, check and double-check that they're bringing the gear they need. In some cases, they may just be providing you bodies or goods and leaving it at that; you may need to source the equipment separately. It can be rented, bought, or even borrowed from your extensive social network. Go through your checklist from napkins to PA systems to extension cords.\n\n\nDecorations are a huge part of any event. Table linens, flowers, gifts, candles, balloons, banners or backdrops for photography, red carpets, (etc) should always be sourced well in advance.\n\n, One thing many rookies forget are the finer points of the facilities. Are there enough? Examples are toilets and bathrooms, car parking spaces, wheelchair access ramps, changing rooms, storage rooms and kitchen space, waste disposal bins, wine coolers, power access, etc. These are obstacles that are only workable if you foresee them well in advance.\n\n\nAlso think outside of your event: will transport and accommodation be required for international or out-of-town guests or delegates at hotels, as well as bookings and space made for their transport to get them to and from the event?\n\n, Understanding the social hierarchy of your event -- if it's not truly yours -- is integral to knowing how to handle any situation. As it is essential that the client has confidence in you, you will need to find out:\n\n\nWho the key guests are\u2013\u2013this is usually straightforward when it is a celebration event\u2013\u2013such as the bride and groom. The client is not always the key guest\/s but may be part of their group, or not present at all.\nWho the host guests are\u2013\u2013these people often act as hosts at their own tables and tend to be good socializes and motivators of guests. These people are useful to keep a convivial atmosphere and strike up a conversation if things turn quiet, encourage people to dance or to introduce people to other guests to make new friendships. These people should be reliable but are generally useful to know as they will keep you informed, may step in and be a guest speaker or MC for you in an emergency and these are the people overall who make the event flow the smoothest at the front line.\nWho the peacemakers are. You should be aware at all times who these key people are as you need to advise them of issues and involve them in the handling of issues and disputes where appropriate. This will generally be the head of the family, a caretaker, or head honchos or hired security.\nWho the decision maker is. For most cases it is yourself as manager, but when you must consult guests and it is not appropriate to involve the key guests (as they typically will be occupied being good hosts), find out who you should consult in an emergency. Ultimately it would be the person who pays the bill if you're charging for your services, or whomever you may deem as \"the client\" as the person having the final say on the matter.\n\n, Well before the event, it's a good idea to scope out your venue and figure out how everything will be set up. You may need to make additional arrangements to accommodate the floor plan -- extension cords, lighting, etc. And if it's hard to find for you, it'll probably be hard to find for your guests, so be sure to take that into account, too!\n\n\nIf it's up to you, map out where everything will go and when. If there isn't room for it, it needs to go. Talk to the venue's manager about what help they're willing and able to pitch in and if there are any city codes you need to abide by, especially in the case of emergency.\n\n, Your crews are going to be working hard. In order to show them your appreciation and to keep them on top of their game, make them a kit to give at the top of the event. Bottles of water, granola bars, chocolates, little tokens of appreciation, whatever you see fit. It'll up morale from the get-go, too.\n\n\nConsider getting them badges or a little party favor to make them feel part of the event and to remember it by. And make sure they stay fed and watered! Always think of your team as resources you want to be able to use in the future.\n\n, Before the event, it's important to have all your ducks in a row. Be sure to provide clear instructions to your crew on how to get to the site and give them your number or preferably a business card with contacts to call if they need directions. Does anybody have any questions? No? And break!\n\n\nMake sure everyone is comfortable with their duties. Some people may not be willing to vocalize this, so read them if at all possible. Do they seem sure and confident? If not, reassure them, go over their duties, and ask them a few basic questions. When in doubt, pair them with a more able partner.\n\n, Your own personal organization is just as important as the event's organization. If you're organized and things go haywire, all can still be fine. But if you're not, hell can break loose. Here's a few ways to prepare yourself:\n\n\nMake a contact sheet with phone numbers and addresses. The baker thought you were picking up the cake? No problem. Call Ashley who lives nearby -- she can swing by the bakery on her way to the event.\nMake a checklist. As teams file in, you'll know what goods, what equipment, and what bodies are missing.\nPrepare invoices and billing as necessary. The more on top of your game you are now, the fewer problems you'll have later.\n\n, Is it likely there will be frequent artistic changes? Weddings are infamous for clients making last minute design changes so it is wise to recommend to your clients a cut-off date for changes. Usually 1 week before the event is leaving it very close, but it gives the client some flexibility and avoids last minute changes coming too late to be practical or cost effective to implement.\n\n\nIf it is simple, subtle or basic changes using already sourced decorations, then it is not unreasonable to accede to change requests. Be as accommodating as possible in what is usually a very emotionally anticipated event.\n\n, Be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations. Make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not. Assist those who need assisting, direct those who need directed, and get out of the way when you need to. No injuries until after the event, please.\n\n\nYou'll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist. Have a portion for your crew, a portion for hired out crews, a portion for decorations and basic set-up, and a portion for equipment. When all is checked off, that's when you have time to breathe.\n\n, Do not be afraid to delegate. The main stressor when it comes to an event is time. To save it, all hands need to be on deck -- or different decks. If someone isn't being as useful as they could be, give them something better to do. It's your job. It's not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries; it's you doing what you're supposed to do.\n\n\nWhen you delegate, be firm but polite. Say, \"Juan, I need you over here right now to help out with the caterers. Thank you.\" Your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does. Keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be.\n\n, This means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind -- and being okay with it. If you start stressing out, you'll lose your head. Nothing good will come of that. So when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion, relax. You'll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice. Event intact.\n\n\nThings happen. They do. They have a bad habit of happening. There's no way you can predict everything, and the sooner you accept this the better. A calm, collected event manager can do wonders for any event; a strung-out, tense one cannot. So relax and go with the flow -- it'll all be over soon!\n\n, Check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity You should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong.\n\n\nConsult with your clients to see how they are feeling; they may be excited, nervous, worried, bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding, some kind words and practical assistance. It is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate.\n\n, Trust and respect your service team to look after themselves -- if you've given them a good base, they should be fine. Offer assistance if needed, but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all. Here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n\nAct as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning, meeting and greeting each guest (if appropriate) as they come. Hand over the reins to the MC when the event starts. The management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan.\nKeep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the MC often and discreetly in case they want (or need) to change plans.\nKeep a respectful distance from the key guests - after all, the event is all about them - but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going, as well as any problems, requests or suggestions they may have.\n\n, You want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had. Actually, you probably want more than that. A visit to a website, future donations, word of mouth buzz, whatever. To ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be, give a takeaway. Whether it's a picture, a flyer, or a pen, having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds.\n\n, Most events tend to run themselves when they start, but all the hard work is the preparation that no-one sees. So pat yourself on the back because you deserve it! Okay, back to tearing it down. The job's not over yet!\n\n\nAfter the event, arrange a time to meet and thank your client. It is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you, as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future. If you gave a gift during the event, such as in a gift registry with the other guests, then a thoughtful after present such as flowers, a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event (such as cutting the ribbon, or the climax of the show, or the award ceremony, or the wedding kiss, or blowing out the candles on a cake, etc), or some other gift may be appropriate.\n\n, Just like mom said, \"Leave it in the same condition you found it in,\" the same goes for your venue. Everything needs to be just like it was before you got there -- this is one business where you don't want to burn any bridges. So let your crews know it's time to tear down and don't let them leave until all is taken care of. And you need to pitch in too!\n\n\nThis is nice, sure, but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be. Many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so. So make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs.\n\n, You may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience. Even if unpaid after the event, thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them. Can you get a business card of theirs?\n\n\nThank your crew, too! Make sure all parties are paid (and all parties have paid up), file receipts, and get everyone taken care of. You should be one of the last ones out the door -- and make sure it's locked behind you.\n\n, This one is a common issue, so it is best to be prepared. By and large, delays are understandably hard to avoid (such as unforeseen traffic issues) and are forgiven by guests who came on time. That being said, here are a few things you can do to do your best to keep it from happening:\n\n\nEnsure that invitations are clear as to the time of the event and if requesting an RSVP, ensure that the time is confirmed. Communicate with (via your contact sheet) the MC, relevant guests (often the leaders of the party members), entertainers and kitchen staff as soon as you're aware of an issue you cannot resolve easily. Should the delayed guests be the focus (such as the bride and groom), the usual methods are:\nContact the delayed guest\/s directly to check for an estimation. Advise the kitchen immediately of all developments so they can slow down or speed up to keep time.\nRefrain from making it known publicly that the event is being delayed because of certain guests (because the party will work that out on their own), but advise key hosts or members of the party that you have been made aware of the fact. Let them know what you intend to do, but allow the hosts to make a suggestion as they know the members of their party and what would be appropriate in the context.\nMaintain careful watch on the time in relation to speeches. If key guests are late, serve an additional appetizer (first course) and\/or beverage early as this will prevent guests who came on time from becoming bored and will keep them occupied.\nFor guests that are going to be delayed for more than is reasonable or possible (such as when serving food that simply cannot wait, such as souffles), start the event as planned and when the delayed guests arrive, start them at the next course of a meal (even if this is dessert).\nOrganise an additional dance, game, speech or other form of entertainment (especially music), and ensure extra distractions, such as group or party photographs are done until they arrive and this back-up strategy should be considered the day in advance.\nFor guests deliberately arriving late, it should be seen as that guest's choice, not your fault as manager, so your duty is first to the guests that are already present and to ensure they're looked after. In a nutshell, act as if there is no problem and carry on regardless.\n\n\n, This one is rare if you have planned things carefully, however accidents do happen (such as a guest or young child making a mess of a food table, or an accident in the kitchen). Early on you should be aware of the type of guests so you can take into account when and where food is displayed (such as for a buffet) and where such guests are seated.\n\n\nAny spillage for safety reasons must be cleaned up immediately, even if it means removing a red carpet or desired d\u00e9cor and furniture to be able to do so. If it is impossible to hide a stain without affecting the appearance or the integrity of the item (such as an antique), then removal is wise. If you have a spare, then use that; if not, move the existing furniture or d\u00e9cor subtly so it does not feel missing.\nA soft rope barrier, curtain or screen is recommended whenever you need to hide the food area (such as a buffet with chafing dishes, or when organising a \"reveal\" of the next course), as certain guests may feel that if food is in the dining area, it is free-for-all, when they want -- which is not always the case.\nShuffle the menu. If part of a dish is not possible to include (such as a side dish that was burnt), either exclude it altogether, find an alternative, reduce the portion sizes to stretch foods, but increase portions of other foods to balance. Advise table hosts as required.\nUnexpected vegetarians, teetotallers, those with food allergies, religious or special diets \u2013\u2013 no surprise should ever occur with proper planning \u2013\u2013 but guests occasionally do bring along additional family members, partners or close friends without advising you, especially if it's not a strict invitation-only event. This is usually easily resolved. Keep a headcount as guests arrive and when they arrive at the door, ask if there are any food requirements and advise the kitchen and service staff immediately.\nFor large unexpected groups that are not gatecrashers, send a team member to the kitchen to take stock and, if necessary, drive out to collect more supplies. Kitchens typically over-cater to cover for accidents and more often there are more cancellations than unexpected guests. Limited portions can be stretched when you provide additional fillers, such as bread rolls, salad or vegetable portions, ingredients for which can be quickly sourced from local supermarkets.\n\n, It's wise to remember that many managers have made serious errors in underestimating the intelligence or forgetting the needs and desires of children at events, as they have the same needs and wants as adults - to have a good time and not be bored. Remember that their parents are also often offended if the event does not cater for their children. In practice, it is best to request an RSVP for every child that may come.\n\n\nYoung children (under 10) are best given food or snacks early as many dinner events have the meals start as late as 8pm, which is far later than most children are used to. Food provided should be fun and healthy but as special as the adult menu as parents appreciate special touches for their children - it makes their job easier so they can have fun as guests in their own right.\nOver 10's usually are fine to be served adult food and portions, even if they don't eat all of it, but offer the children's menu to them (with their parent's permission) if they don't seem keen on the options. It has also been known for young adults 13-18 to often request the same food as youngsters, such as a hamburger and fries as opposed to more formal restaurant food and it has been a frequently used trick to re-brand the children's menu as an \"Alternative Menu\" for this age group of guests. It is very wise to play safe and discuss with key guests about your plans to keep the young and old engaged, well in advance of the date.\nA discrete area should be provided for mothers with young children for their needs such as toilet\/bathroom breaks, breastfeeding (etc.), and a place for very young children to sleep in if they are tired.\n\n, Ideally this would never happen, but it does \u2013\u2013 family or corporate events both. Politics and drama often come out at events that, as an outsider, you would not be always aware of. Prepare yourself.\n\n\nAsk the client or key guests before the event of the likelihood of such issues, or with selected hosting guests if it is not appropriate to discuss these issues with the key guests, so that way you can ensure that people are seated in places that will not cause issue. Enlist service staff or key-guests to act as unofficial monitors, to keep an eye out for issues and to step in when required. Strictly speaking, your duty is to ensure the event is smoothly run, but only where it is appropriate, and to stay out of issues that are a private concern. Therefore, you should be aware of who within the party are the \"peacemakers\" of the group.\nAs it can be a difficult job to refuse alcohol to an inebriated guest, or to deal with an inebriated guest that inclines towards anger or violence, it is wise to enlist a peacemaker guest and only involve law enforcement when necessary after consulting with the key guests. Even in small events or backyard events when alcohol is often stored in an ice box for guests to serve themselves, it is equally important to be aware.\nGatecrashers are difficult. Should it happen, unobtrusively evict them if appropriate - consult your key guests to verify that they're unwelcome. For large scale and rowdy or abusive gatecrashers, your duty is to protect the existing guests where appropriate and to call security or the police if they do not leave after being politely asked to do so by yourself and\/or the key guests.\nGuests often shuffle name cards about at the beginning where they are sitting, so that they end up sitting next to people they want, or at a table they want. It is wise to check with the key guests how far this is permissible according to them. Typically you should have organised table plans in advance and have received approval from the key guests. Should it be that people must be at certain tables, then it is wise to keep people out of the dining room altogether until time. Often the lobby, foyer or bar area serves this purpose and if it is very important due to family issues, it is wise to group people together and move them en masse to the separate tables by each host-guest and service personnel to seat them in their proper order.\n\n, Sudden, unexpected rain or snow can be common in parts of the world; likewise, a heatwave or a cold front can also can pose a problem. While weather events are not usually an issue if you're indoors, being outside makes things difficult. If bad weather is expected, then consider moving the event location. If the event cannot be relocated or rescheduled, hire a large tent or pavilion (admittedly this can be pricey on short notice). Keeping an eye on weather developments as you go is important; very little can be done to salvage an event affected by weather, so make the best of what you have.\n\n\nMany parts of the world now have insurance policies in the event of severe weather or other problems. If you are in an area which is known for unexpectedly changeable weather, it is recommended to source a quote if there may be a chance the event will have to be re-scheduled as it will at least cover the client the cost of extending hire of equipment, site and service personnel.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":877}
{"text":" One of the most common, important uses of hyphens is to string together related words and concepts to form single words and unified phrases. For example, terms like \"state-of-the-art\", \"first-timer\", and \"penny-pincher\" all use hyphens to create a single idea from multiple words.\n\n\nHere are a few examples of hyphens being used correctly in compound words:\n\nThe singer was infamous for his over-reliance on autotune.\n\n\nThat ten-year-old is remarkably mature for her age.\n\n\nAs a general rule, you should never put spaces around a hyphen (e.g., write \"ten-year-old\", not \"ten - year - old.\";\n, Most words with prefixes, like \"predetermined\" and \"evermore\" don't need hyphens. However, some prefixes (namely, \"ex-\", \"self-\", \"all-\", and sometimes \"cross-\") need hyphens to separate them from the word they're modifying. Note that \"cross\" doesn't need to be hyphenated in words like \"crossword,\" where it is part of the word itself, nor in terms like \"cross purposes,\" where it is a separate word, as it's not being used as a prefix in these cases.\n\n\nHere is an example of a hyphen being used for prefixes:\n\nShe frequently accused her ex-boyfriend of being completely self-absorbed.\n\n\n\n, Similar to the way they are used for compound words, hyphens can also be used to create descriptive, colorful terms that may not be found in the dictionary. Hyphens used in this way allow you to create your own words from scratch. However, it's important to remember not to rely too heavily on unique hyphenated words, as this can become distracting. If you can convey your ideas just as well with one or more normal words, do so.\n\n\nHere is an example of a unique hyphenated word used well:\n\nKim took time off from her job and became a professional couch-sitter in the days just before giving birth.\n\n\nHere is an example of a unique hyphenated word being used in a way that's not necessary. In this case, the hyphens don't make the term any easier to understand.\n\nI couldn't decide what to get at the pizza place, so I ordered my usual three-cheese-no-meat combo.\n\n\n\n, Some words are hyphenated when neglecting the hyphen would make the meaning of the word unclear. For instance, to convey the idea of a duplicate or replica, a writer may use the word \"re-creation\" in place of \"recreation\" because the latter can also mean \"fun\" or \"entertainment\". Hyphens can also be used in a similar way to make compound words more visually appealing in cases where the first word ends with the same letter that the second starts with.\n\n\nHere are a few examples of hyphens used for clarity. In the first, \"re-signed\" has a different meaning than \"resigned\" and \"foreign-film theater\" has a less ambiguous meaning than \"foreign film theater\". In the second, the hyphen separates the first \"e\" from the second.\n\nJeremy re-signed his contract, then took the train to the foreign-film theater to celebrate.\n\n\nAfter the convicts passed a compulsory period of good behavior, the re-education program began in earnest.\n\n\n\n, Though the rules for when to use numerals and when to spell out numbers can vary from style guide to style guide, many grammatical sources will recommend using a hyphen for two-word numbers below one hundred. In other words, use hyphens for the numbers twenty-one through ninety-nine, with the exceptions of thirty, forty, fifty, etc. This also means that after one hundred, you'll still use hyphens between the numbers in the \"tens\" and \"ones\" places (e.g. \"two hundred twenty-two\").\n\n\nHere is an example of correct number hyphenation:\n\nThe wedding reception had eighty-eight guests, but the cooks only prepared seventy-nine entrees.\n\n\n\n, When writing fractions out as words, rather than writing them as numerals, you should separate the two numbers in the fraction with a hyphen. This rule is true even for mixed fractions (fractions preceded by a whole number, like \"three and five-sixths\").\n\n\nHere is an example of hyphens used correctly in two fractions:\n\nThe snickerdoodle recipe calls for two and two-thirds cups of flour and two and one-quarter cups of sugar.\n\n\n\n, When someone has two last names (usually because his or her parents kept their own last names after marriage), the names are hyphenated. In rare cases where someone has three or more last names, all of the names are hyphenated.\n\n\nHere is an example of hyphens used correctly for last names:\n\nWhen Suzie Sanders-Johnson and Tim Rodriguez-Lyle had their first child, they weren't sure what his last name would be.\n\n\n\n, In cases where a sentence calls for a list of hyphenated words or numbers that share a common word, it's usually OK to write the word only for the last item in the list. For the other items in the list, write the word or number followed by a hyphen. Separate each item with a comma as you normally would in a list.\n\n\nHere is an example of hyphens used in a list:\n\nFor this construction project, we're going to need plenty of ten-, twenty-, and fifty-inch boards.\n\n\n\n, If you're ever unsure of when (or when not) to use a hyphen, consult a reference source for guidance. A wide variety of grammar references are available both in print, in libraries or book stores, and online. Be sure to choose a reference source that's well-qualified and professional. It's hard to go wrong with the \"big three\" style guides: APA Style, MLA Style, and Chicago\/Turabian Style.\n\n\nNote that minor differences may exist between the style guides you consult. For instance, the MLA style guide allows you to use hyphens for expressing number ranges (e.g., 350-400 degrees), while the Chicago style guide recommends an en dash., Some words which are technically compound words have become so commonplace and well-known that hyphenating them can actually make their meaning less clear. For example, \"lunchtime\" and \"roommate\" don't need to be hyphenated, as these common words' meanings are perfectly clear without hyphens. Note that in some cases, hyphens are optional: both \"high school\" and \"high-school\" are generally considered acceptable.\n\n\nHere is an example of compound words that don't need hyphens:\n\nI will read you a story at bedtime, but only if you correct the misprints in your book report .\n\n\n\n, As noted above, except in some exceptional cases, most words with prefixes don't need hyphens and will look cumbersome if an unnecessary hyphen is added. There are too many of these \"normal\" prefixes that don't require a hyphen to list, but here are just a few: \"pre-\", \"post-\", \"non-\", \"un-\", \"anti-\", \"re-\", \"bi-\", \"di-\", and \"de-\".Here is an example of words with prefixes that don't need hyphens:\n\nThe recycled paper was strangely unaffected by the heat of the fire.\n\n\n\n, When a compound word or phrase can be used as both a verb and a noun or adjective, you generally shouldn't include a hyphen if the word is used as a verb. For instance, the term \"back up\" can be used as a verb and a noun to mean both \"to make a copy of something for safekeeping\" and \"a copy of something\", respectively. Thus, you would write \"back up\" as a verb like this: \"Please back up your hard disk data,\" and write it as a noun like this: \"He is our back-up plan if the other candidate doesn't want the job.\"\n\n\nHere is an example of a verb that doesn't need a hyphen:\n\nTell the repairman to fix it.\n\n\nHowever, the same phrase can use a hyphen when it becomes an adjective:\n\nCall our usual fix-it guy, please.\n\n\n\n, Some words, like \"today\" and \"tonight\", were once hyphenated like normal compound words. This is generally not done in modern writing, so you shouldn't feel any need to include these superfluous hyphens unless you're specifically trying to mimic an old-fashioned tone or style.\n\n\nHere is an example of words that once used hyphens but do not today:\n\nI shall meet you tomorrow at sunup when the cock crows and not one moment sooner.\n\n\n\n, Though hyphens are used to construct many compound words and phrases, you shouldn't use them after adverbs that end with \"-ly\", like \"softly\", \"strongly\", and \"deftly\", and after the word \"very\" when it's used as an adverb. Note, however, that you can use hyphens after words that end with \"-ly\" if they aren't adverbs, like \"family\", \"barely\", and so on. As a reminder, adverbs are words that modify or qualify a verb, adjective, or another adverb.Here is an example of adverbs that don't need a hyphen:\n\nThe quickly drying paint was bone dry within the hour.\n\n\nNote that hyphens can be used correctly after a word ending in \"-ly\" that is not an adverb:\n\nThe little boy reached toward the friendly-looking rabbit without fear.\n\n\n\n, When you use a compound adjective to compare two or more things or ideas, you shouldn't use a hyphen. This rule stems from the fact that the meaning of these types of adjectives is clear without the aid of a hyphen. For instance, you would never say that one house is \"better-constructed than the other\", but saying that a house is \"better constructed than the other\" is just fine.\n\n\nHere are a few examples of comparative and superlative adjectives that don't need hyphens:\n\nAfter the boxing match, one fighter was clearly more bruised than the other.\n\n\nEven the best laid plans sometimes go awry.\n\n\n\n, Though it's usually somewhat rare that a person with a non-technical background might have to write at length about chemistry-related topics, it's still useful to note that the names of specific chemicals don't contain hyphens. This is true even for chemicals with long names containing multiple prefixes, like monochloroacetic acid.\n\n\nHere is an example of chemical names where hyphens are not needed:\n\nAfter adding the cyclopentane to the Erlenmeyer flask, the scientist stirred in 5 milliliters of hydrochloric acid.\n\n\n\n, Two symbols called the en dash and the em dash resemble the hyphen but are used for different purposes. En dashes (\"\u2013\") are slightly longer than a hyphen, while em dashes (\"\u2014\") are even longer. In informal writing, you can usually get away with using hyphens and dashes interchangeably, but in formal contexts, you'll want to keep the uses of each distinct, as it can be considered a grammar error to do so. Following these general rules can help you keep your use of hyphens and dashes distinct. Below are a few of the situations in which you'll need to use dashes:\n\n\nRanges of dates, numbers, times, and values (en dashes)\nPrefixes for words which don't usually have them (en dashes)\nSubstituting for blank or missing content (em dashes)\nAbrupt sentence interruptions (em dashes)\nPunctuating a sentence with extra information (em dashes)\n\n, En dashes are often used to express the idea that two or more words or numbers are connected by a range of values in between. For instance, in the sentence \"We just delivered the Jan\u2013Apr issue,\" the dash implies that the magazine is for January through April, not just January and April. Note that when using en dashes for ranges, you shouldn't put a space on either side of the dash.\n\n\nHere is an example of an en dash used to express a range:\n\nWould you please schedule me an appointment for 1:00\u20132:00 PM?\n\n\n\n, In general cases, you shouldn't use any sort of punctuation mark for common prefixes like \"pre-\", \"post-\", \"re-\", and so on. However, when connecting this sort of prefix to a word like a proper noun, a complex phrase, or a word that would look awkward or cumbersome without some sort of separating mark, it's acceptable to use an en dash. Obviously, however, en dashes shouldn't be used for words like \"preselect\" or \"postgame\" where the meaning is already clear.\n\n\nHere are a few examples of en dashes used to attach prefixes:\n\nThe professor's degree in the pre\u2013Cold War history of Russia qualified him to teach his course on Czar Nicholas II.\n\n\nPost\u2013Andy Kaufman, the comedy landscape just didn't seem as vivid.\n\n\n\n, Em dashes can be used to abruptly break the flow of a sentence to convey related information, add commentary, and more. Em dashes used in this way can either come before the words inserted into the middle of the sentence or before and after them if the original sentence continues after the interruption. Unlike typical hyphen and dash usage, some grammatical resources allow you to separate em dashes from the rest of the sentence with spaces when used this way.Below are a few examples of em dashes used to interrupt sentences:\n\nDeborah \u2014 who was nineteen \u2014 still loved the swings at the local park.\n\n\nThere's no need to lock the door \u2014 I'm coming out after you.\n\n\n\n, Em dashes can also be used at the end of a sentence to show that the flow of words has abruptly ceased before the sentence would normally have ended. In this case, you shouldn't end the sentence with a period, question mark, or exclamation point as you normally would. This is an especially useful tool for written dialog, as it allows you to show when one character interrupts another by speaking over him.\n\n\nHere's an example of an em dash being used to show someone's speech being interrupted:\n\nWhere are we going? The police are right --\u2014\" \"Shh! They'll hear you.\"\n\n\n\n, In some cases, when information is intentionally left out, it's acceptable to use one or more em dashes to substitute for the missing words or letters. Often, this is used in citations: some style guides call for three em dashes to be used in place of an author's name when it needs to be listed many times in a row.This can also be used to \"censor\" the names of people or places to keep them confidential.\n\n\nHere is an example of an em dash being used to substitute for missing information:\n\nThe paranormal incident took place in the night sky just outside of the rural town of N\u2014\u2014.\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":878}

{"text":" You probably won't be getting much sleep the night you go out. You could end up at an after-party with the band or doing karaoke with the DJ's aunt. Either way, you are probably not going to sleep early. Drinking also interferes with your ability to get R.E.M. sleep, so you probably won\u2019t rest well when you finally do get to bed. Getting plenty of rest before going out drinking is essential.\n\n\nIf you know you're going to go big this weekend, make sure you get adequate sleep during the weekdays to prepare.;\n, A night of drinking can disrupt your ability to stay focused, solve problems, and do complex tasks long afterwards. For example, drinking five or more drinks in a night can affect your brain and body for up to three days. If you\u2019re planning to go out drinking, it's best not to choose a night that\u2019s right before a test, major work project, etc.\n\n\nTaking a break now and then from drinking as an activity can also be a good idea. For example, designating one weekend a month as an alcohol-free period can help you rest and recover., If you drink on an empty stomach, you will feel the effects of alcohol much faster, which can mean your night ends too soon. If you eat well and drink plenty of water before going out drinking, your body will slow its absorption of the alcohol you drink.\n\n\nEating beforehand stops you from feeling drunk as fast, but your body will still metabolize all of the alcohol eventually.In other words, you will still be affected by the alcohol, but you will not feel it as quickly.\nGood choices of foods and drink to consume beforehand include bread, meat, cheese, pasta, milk, etc. (all foods which will be digested slowly and\/or are high in protein).Continuing to eat protein-rich foods while drinking will also slow your body\u2019s absorption of alcohol. If you can, carry healthy snacks in your backpack, purse, or close by incase you need a snack to slow down alcohol absorption.\n\n, Alcohol can impair your decision-making abilities, so it is a good idea to agree upon a plan for the night before going out. Make sure you and any friends joining you agree on where and when to go, and when to return. Make sure that everyone will have a safe way home at the end of the night. Sticking to a plan like this will help keep anyone from getting lost or separated and from winding up in a dangerous place or situation.\n\n, If anyone will need a vehicle during the night, make sure that someone serves as the designated driver, or that a taxi or public transportation can be arranged.\n\n\nProtect yourself and others. Don't drink and drive.\n\n, It can be easy to lose things when you are drinking, since alcohol can impair your judgment and short-term memory. Bars, clubs, and other locations can also be crowded, increasing the risk of loss or theft. To prevent this, leave unnecessary valuables at home and keep a close eye on personal items such as a wallet or purse.\n\n, Drinking too fast is one way to ruin a night. If you have too many drinks in a short period of time, you may not realize how much alcohol you\u2019ve had and end up sick or worse. Drinking no more than one drink an hour gives your body some time to metabolize the alcohol so that you don\u2019t become too drunk too fast.Remember that all drinks aren\u2019t the same. 12 ounces of beer, 8 or 9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor generally have roughly the same amount of alcohol.When keeping track of the number of drinks you\u2019ve had, however, remember that the alcohol content of individual drinks can vary widely. A high-gravity ale, for instance, could have nearly twice as much alcohol as the same amount of a light beer.\nIf you are having mixed drinks, make sure that someone you trust is doing the mixing, and not making them too strong.\nDrinking water in between alcoholic drinks helps you to stay hydrated and from getting to drunk too fast. Just remember \u201cSpacers, not chasers!\u201d, Going out drinking with friends can be a way of having fun if everyone is safe. It might even seem funny if someone winds up passed out on a stranger\u2019s lawn wearing someone else\u2019s clothes. It\u2019s important to realize, however, that drinking too much can be dangerous and even deadly.Females are recommended to drink no more than four drinks at a time, and males no more than five.\nIf you are drinking at high altitudes, remember that your body\u2019s tolerance for alcohol may be lower.Avoid binge drinking, keg stands, and drinking games.These activities can cause you to drink too fast, lose control, become sick, or even experience alcohol poisoning, which can be deadly.\nIf you are worried about drinking too much, or drinking too quickly, you can try showing up late to the bar, party, club, etc.That way, you\u2019ll have less time to drink. You can also try starting with or switching to a soft drink at some point so that you drink less alcohol.\n\n, This helps to space out your alcohol consumption so that you don\u2019t drink too quickly. Alcohol dehydrates you as it is absorbed and metabolized, and this can cause a hangover. Replacing that water as you drink and when you wake up will help to ward off the dreaded hung-over feeling.\n\n\nMany bars have pitchers or containers of water out so you can help yourself. Make sure you locate this early in the night and visit often.\nIf you are at home or at a house party, keep a bottle of water with you so you can hydrate throughout the night.\n\n, Make sure that everyone knows the plan for the night, stays together, and makes good choices.\n\n\nEven if no one will be driving, you might want to designate someone to stay sober for the night. This person can help make sure everyone stays together and safe.\nIf at least two people stay sober for the night (to be the DD or otherwise), it can be more fun for them, since one person won\u2019t be left alone not drinking.\nYou and your friends can take turns being the DD\/sober person on different nights.\n\n, If you see anything or anyone that looks suspicious during the night, stay away. Things to watch out and stay away from include:\n\n\nBar fights\nSuspicious people\nDark, isolated places\n\n, This will ensure that you do not have a drink that has been \u201cspiked\u201d with a drug or other substance.\n\n, You may also not know how the combination of alcohol and another substance will affect you, making it more difficult to stay in control of your actions and stay safe.\n\n, Make sure that you can trust the people you are with and avoid making decisions you\u2019ll regret later.\n\n\nBe prepared to practice safe sex if you think it might be part of your plans for the night.\n\n, Even if you are drunk, or drinking underage, seek help if someone becomes injured, unresponsive, violent, or seems in danger of harming him\/herself or someone else. Sensible authorities are more concerned with making sure that people stay safe and protected than with who's drinking what.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":882}
{"text":" Grow your own, or ask around at produce stands or farmers' markets in late summer. Pickling cucumbers are smaller than most salad cucumbers, perhaps 1 to 1\u00a01\u20442 inches (2.5 to 3.8\u00a0cm) in diameter and 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2\u00a0cm) long. Plan that 6 to 7 medium pickling cucumbers, or about one pound, sliced, will yield about 3 cups. Thus, for six quarts of sliced cucumbers, you will need about 8 pounds of cucumbers.;\n, Do not peel them. Measure the sliced cucumbers until you have about 6 quarts. Cut out any bad spots as you go.\n\n, Leave them in half-rings, or if you prefer, aim for bite-sized lengths.\n\n, Cover the cucumber and onion mixture in this brine. Let the mixture soak for three hours.\n\n, If you prepare them ahead of time, store them upside-down on a clean towel, covered by another clean towel.\n\n,, Bring the vinegar, sugar, and spices to a boil in a large saucepan or pot. Then, add the drained vegetables to the mixture and bring the combination to a boil.\n\n, Boil about an inch of water in the bottom of a wide saucepan. Remove the saucepan from heat and place the jar lids individually into the water. Let them sit for a minute or two. Do this immediately prior to use.\n\n, Leave 1\u20442 inch (1.3\u00a0cm) of head space (space between the top of the food and the jar rim). Pour the hot pickling liquid over the vegetables, leaving 1\u20442 inch (1.3\u00a0cm) of head space. Stir the pickling liquid as you go to keep the spices mixed in.\n\n,, Use a lid wand to lift the seals out of the hot water. Center the seal on the rim of the jar. Screw on the ring so that it is snug but do not over-tighten. (The idea is to contact the wax sealing surface firmly without displacing it altogether.)\n\n, Fill the canner with hot water until the tops of the jars are at least an inch below the surface of the water.\n\n,, The next day, check the seals by pressing down in the center.

{"text":" Breeding budgies takes time and isn\u2019t easy. You need to cash out on supplies and feed, check on the budgies often, clean the cage daily and set aside extra time for caring for the chicks.;\n, The room should be quiet, protected from predators including pets, have no disturbances and the only person entering the room should be you.\n\n, Choose one that is approximately two feet wide. The cage should be wider than it is tall (budgies fly horizontally), square-topped and have at least three doors: one for the food dish, one for the water dish and one for you to easily access the cage. You might need to cut a small hole in the cage for the nest box (see below for a nest box).\n\n\nAdd bedding to the box. Suitable bedding include safe wood shavings or plain rolled oats.\n\n, You\u2019ll not only need to prepare items for the mating budgies but also for the budgies chicks as well. You'll likely need:\n\n\nA couple of perches. Make sure the perch is a natural wood and isn\u2019t dangerous to your budgies.\nA few toys for the male budgie. Make sure you don\u2019t have so many toys so that the cage is cramped and do not put the toys too close that can cause the male to get hurt. It\u2019s also recommended that you do not put any rope toys in the cage as the budgies and fledgling chicks might get tangled up in them.\nA feeder.\nWater dishes including an extra one for when the baby budgies fledge.\nBudgie seed.\nBudgie pellets.\nA cuttle bone for extra calcium.\nLiquid calcium or crushed oyster shell (two of these calcium sources at least).\nA mineral block.\nExtra food for when the baby budgies fledge.\nBaby budgie food\nA small syringe\nA spare cage for when the chicks grow up.\n\n, If your budgie pair have a big hatch you may encounter some problems with the youngest chicks getting cared for properly. This is why you have to prepare a safe and warm home for an abandoned or neglected chick. However, it\u2019s a bit rare to get more than one neglected chick during one hatch.\n\n, Good dimensions are: (9\" (H) X 6\" to 8\" (W) X 6\" to 7\"(D) with an entry hole of 2 inches (5.1 cm) diameter).\n\n\nMake sure that it has a little dish in it so the eggs don't roll and get rolled out of the nest and away from the heat of the mother bird. This is important so the eggs don't get cold. A concave also helps prevent splayed legs.\n\n, If you like, make your own nest box from coconut husks. A coconut husk makes an ideal choice as it is not only snug but also offers something to bite on should the budgie get such a notion.\n\n\nLocate three coconut husks. They need to be roughly the same size.\nDrill some holes in one of the husks. Make a hole in the top part of the husk, a hole on one side and another hole on the other edge.\nRepeat for the other two husks.\nDraw the husks together using bird-safe wire or string. Thread through the drilled holes.\nMake a hanger hole at the front of the husk. Or, make it wherever it seems appropriate.\nHang the husk in the breeding cage.\nAdd nesting materials to nest box (E.G. pine shavings).\n\n, The pair must be older than 12 months but the hen younger than 3 years and the male younger than 5 years old. They should be healthy and have no deformities or illnesses such as splayed legs, french moult or similar.\n\n\nYou could also buy a budgie pair that is from the same cage\/aviary so that they know each other already. If you don\u2019t buy a budgie pair from the same cage you will have to spend time trying to get them both used to each other and it will also take them quite some time trying to bond. Be aware they may be related and it is never a good idea to breed related birds.\nYou can purchase healthy budgies from a local pet shop or from another reliable breeder. A good budgie pair should be alert, awake and making lots of noise whilst a bad budgie pair would be sleepy, huddled up and its eyes would be cloudy.\nWhen ever you aquire a new bird remember to quarantine it in a seperate room, in a seperate cage for a minimum of 6 weeks. This is very important in ensuring the bird is not sick and doesn't spread anything to your other birds if it is. Birds in quarantine should not be bred.\n\n, If you are going to start breeding budgies you will want to breed from a healthy budgie pair that is being cared for properly. This way you will most likely have a successful hatch of baby budgies.\n\n\nEverything should be clean including the cage, bedding, feeders and water containers. Depending on the amount of budgies there is in one cage, it should also be spacious and not cramped.\nThe feeders should be filled with feed and the budgies should be fed a balanced diet consisting of seeds, fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, etc. The water containers should also be filled with fresh, clean water.\n\n, Budgies won\u2019t breed until they have adjusted to the new surroundings and they also need time to bond. You will have to wait for at least four weeks for them to consider mating.\n\n, Keep all details, including a phone number, close at hand. You never know when something will go wrong, so when it does, call.\n\n\nIt\u2019s also good to get your budgies checked out by an avian vet to make sure they are not sick and are suitable to breed.\n\n, A good diet consists of fruits, veggies, seeds, grains, etc. You can also purchase a budgie seed mix and pellets that you can feed to your budgie along with the safe fruits and veggies.\n\n\nBe aware that budgies eat a lot more when the chicks hatch so you should give them some extra food when the chicks do come about.\n\n, The water container (and feeder) should be next to the perch and it should also be cleaned at least once a week.\n\n, Rinse the cage and feeders out, dispose of all bedding and get rid of the feed\/water and supply fresh feed\/water. Bedding should only be changed once all the eggs have hatched. While the chicks are small it will only need changing every few days, when they are older or it is a large clutch the bedding will need to be changed daily. Avoid using cleaning products that aren\u2019t safe for your budgies.\n\n, Do not disturb the budgies. They will do their \"thing\" in their own time, but disturbing them and constantly hovering over them is not going to help. You may not catch them mating, but if you do, let them be. If you don\u2019t the female\/hen will tell the male to get off and the mating will stop. The female budgie will soon lay about 4-6 eggs.\n\n, Candling the eggs means that you will know which eggs are fertile and which eggs are not. You can find candling steps online. Be very gentle and avoid touching the eggs, if you are going to touch the eggs at least wash your hands first to prevent passing on bacteria to the egg. Candling every few days during incubation can also help to determine if any of the embryos die. Any Dead In Shell (DIS) eggs need to be discarded to prevent spreading bacteria to the healthy eggs.\n\n\nBe aware that this step is optional; it's recommended that you do your research first before deciding.\n\n, The chicks will begin to hatch around day 16-21 so it is very important that you check the nest box daily. Try to do this when the mother bird is out eating or you can teach her to leave by tapping on the box before opening it.\n\n\nGently check the chicks over for injury (scratches, bruises or missing down feathers), seeds\/air bubbles in the crop (the sack at the base of the chick's neck).\nCheck that the crop is full (bulging).\nMake sure no food is stuck inside the top of the upper mandible (top of the beak). If there is food, gently pick it away with the end of a matchstick or the quill-end of a feather. If the food is not removed it will retard beak growth.\nClean off any poop and\/or food from around the toes, beak, eyes, and other body parts with a soft, damp, and warm cloth.\nRemove\/dispose of any dead chicks or eggs in the nesting box.\n\n,, If you see any problems with the chicks and the mother (E.G the mother isn\u2019t feeding one chick) then consider hand-raising a chick or two.\n\n, Chicks also mean poop, so the nest box must be cleaned out regularly. When the hen is out eating, remove the chicks to a small container lined with soft paper towels. Scrape out the soiled bedding and scrape away wet poops from the bottom of the nest box, then replace the nesting materials with fresh stuff. Gently replace chicks back. Make sure to be as quick as possible. (This should not be done until all fertile eggs have hatched)\n\n, Simply put it in the box. The mother bird will nibble at it and immediately regurgitate this for her chicks. The babies may also take a bite or two, mimicking their mother. This helps with weaning later on as chicks recognise the seed as being food straight away. At 3 weeks old the mother may also stop feeding the chicks and the father will take over. This is completely normal however you will need to watch the mother and possibly seperate her as she may harm the chicks if she attempts to mate and nest while they are still in the box.\n\n, When the chicks finally fledge at the age of 28-35 days old, put a dish of seed at the bottom of their cage. Though the father bird feeds them entirely at this stage, you want to encourage them to start eating solid food as soon as possible. It\u2019s also a great idea to provide a bowl of chopped fresh fruits and veggies \u2013 fledglings love to explore and try new things!\n\n\nYou should also provide a bowl full of fresh, clean water at the bottom of the cage for the chicks. Make sure the bowl is shallow and that the chicks can access it easily. If it is too big you can add some marbles to stop the chicks from drowning.\n\n,\n\nMake sure that baby birds don't stay in there all day, Maybe take it out for a few hours a day so the baby birds can explore the cage and remember to eat and drink.\n\n, Since you want chicks to stay with the male bird as long as possible it is best to seperate the mother.\n\n, You can let the hen go on for a second round but often it causes a lot of stress on the breeding pair. When the last chick fledges, remove the nest box immediately and seal the hole where the nest box was. Perhaps separate the mother bird from the father bird and the chicks, as she may be a bit mean to her babies.\n\n\nBack to back clutches can be OK if the pair are in great health and have not already had more that one previous clutch immediately prior to laying again. It is best to give your pair a 6 months break before allowing them to breed again.\n\n, Males will have a pink or purple cere (nose) and females will have white or pale blue. Guess what, you made a budgie happy family!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":884}
{"text":" Keep in mind that it takes these seeds two to three months to sprout. You can bypass this process by getting a seedling or small plant from a nursery.;\n, Change the water each day.\n\n, Plastic containers used for starts will allow for easy transplanting later on. Fill the container with soil and place the seed approximately 3\/4 of an inch (2cm) or less below the surface.\n\n, Depending upon your weather, you can place it outside or in a greenhouse.\n\n, When at least one leaf has appeared, you can transplant it. If you have a variable climate, you may want to wait until it is more established to plant it in the ground.\n\n\nIf you have been germinating the seed in a low-sun area, you will need to move it into the sun and slowly increase the number of hours of sunlight. If not, it will burn in the sun.\n\n, Queen palms have shallow, grass-like root systems, so other features, such as concrete or structures can be placed fairly close to it. The queen palm also likes a small amount of shade.,, It should be the depth of the top and no deeper.\n\n, Add sand or Canadian peat moss if the soil doesn\u2019t drain well.\n\n, Loosen the palm from the pot and then place the plant and the soil from the pot in the hole. Fill in the area around the plant with more soil mix.\n\n,,, Water every other day for the next week. Use a bubbler or soaker to ensure that the ground stays moist.\n\n, You will generally want to water three times per week in the summer and twice per week in the winter. Due to its grass-like structure, it must be watered more than most trees., The following are good guidelines:\n\n\nWith temperatures below 85 (29 Celsius) you can water one to two times per week.\nWith 85 to 100 degrees (29 to 38 Celsius) you can water two to three times per week.\nWith temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), you should water four to five times per week., Use a slow release blend that contains magnesium, iron, copper, manganese and nitrogen.\n\n, A healthy queen palm can grow up to six feet (1.8m) per year once established. It can grow to the height of 30 or 40 feet (9 to 12m).\n\n, This is an indication that your plant needs manganese. This is unlikely to be native to the soil, so you will need to add more manganese to the soil at the first sign of this condition.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":885}
{"text":" Maltese do like company and can bark or suffer anxiety related problems if they are left alone for long periods of time. Think about whether you can structure your day so that the Maltese is not left alone for more than 4 hours at a time.\n\n\nBe aware that because Maltese like to be with people, they can easily become over-dependant on human company and suffer from stress or \"separation anxiety\" unless trained from a young age to cope in solitude. To train the dog to do this means deliberately spending small periods of time away from the dog so that it learns to be alone. Be careful not to over pamper the dog as this can make it even more difficult for it when you're not there to fuss it.Most Maltese are friendly, outgoing, and relatively fearless but because they are small (4-7 lbs) and have delicate bones, they are easily injured. As a result, they can become fearful or aggressive. Keep an eye on them around larger animals, and show children how to hold the Maltese properly without squeezing or dropping him. If you have very young children, you might want to consider a sturdier breed like a Shih Tzu, Havanese, or Bichon. ;\n, Be aware that the Maltese feel the cold easily. If your home is chilly or you live in a cold environment, then reconsider your choice of dog. Also be aware they have long silky coats, which needs daily grooming and will need to have their hair trimmed regularly because Maltese do not shed like most other breeds. Although this is an added expense (unless you learn to do it yourself), the upside is that the Maltese (like the Poodle) is a relatively hypoallergenic breed., If you can't commit to such a long term undertaking, or you expect your circumstances to change, then reconsider getting a dog , especially one that can live to be 14 or 15. Adopting a dog is a long-term commitment, not something to take lightly.\n\n, There are thousands of Maltese breeders out there, but there are also plenty of purebreds in animal shelters. If you know someone with a Maltese ask where that person got it. Make sure that before you bring your Maltese home, that it gets along with other pets or children you may have.\n\n\nMake sure you see the Maltese puppy with his mother. If for whatever reason the mother is not present, walk away. This is a give away sign that the puppy is from a puppy mill and such immoral breeding programs should not be encouraged.Make sure your Maltese was socialized well as a puppy, as this helps make it become a confident outgoing adult.\n\n, If you don't want to deal with the upkeep a shorter \"puppy cut\" looks cute on a Maltese. You will need to have him professionally groomed maybe once every six weeks but will still need to brush his hair daily using a nice, soft brush. Remove excess hair and untangle knots while the hair is dry or with a special detangler. Bathing him first will make the tangles worse.\n\n\nYou may need to use a comb to get to the root of any tangles and knots. Remember to gently tease them apart. Take extreme care cutting out knots, as it is all too easy to nick the skin., You may need to bathe a playful puppy once a week, while a calm, older dog will only need a monthly bath.Wash its hair like it's your own, only be very gentle! Don't forget to clean your pup's face with a washcloth.\n\n, Maltese dogs have white hair that is prone to tear staining. You will recognize this as the brown streaks down the face of a white dog. This happens when tears overspill onto the cheek and stay there for a few hours. Substances in the tear fluid oxidizes and change to that rust-colored pigment, which causes the staining.\n\n\nTo avoid this, dry the area around your dog's eyes regularly. The amount of tear overflow varies with each individual dog and is more pronounced when they are teething. If the lower lid area or cheek are constantly wet, then wipe hourly. For dogs with less moisture from the eyes, you only need to wipe twice a day or when you spot gloop in the corner of the eye.\nThere are various commercial products available for wiping eyes, but previously boiled water on cotton wool is perfectly sufficient. Dampen the cotton wool with the cool water and wipe away any moisture or stickiness from the eye area. Then finish with a dry piece of cotton wool to pat the area dry.\n\n, Many people don't do this, but it is very, very important, especially for older dogs. This will slow up tartar formation and protect your dog's dental health. Start at a young age, so the dog accepts having its teeth brushed. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs. It can be purchased at any pet store.\n\n\nBe aware the Maltese are especially prone to the formation of plaque and then tartar formation. This irritates the gums leading to inflammation and infection. Ultimately this causes gum recession and the teeth to loosen, become infected, and fall out.\nIf this is your first time, rub the gums and teeth with your finger. Adding some soft dog food can make this more pleasant. Brush your dog's teeth before bed.\nAlternatively speak to your vet about small-sized kibble that has a cleaning action as the dog chews. Be aware that canned food is more likely to build tartar than dry food, and speed up tartar formation.\n\n, Maltese nails should be clipped monthly so they do not overgrow and get infected. Using a regular nail clipper, slowly begin to clip the end of your dog's nails, stopping before you reach the live center of the nail. If you are uncertain how much nail to remove, invest in a lesson from the groomer or vet tech.\n\n\nThe nail has a living center made up of blood vessels and nerves, called the quick. If you clip too much nail away you will cut the quick, which is painful for the dog and causes bleeding. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and remove the minimum amount possible.\nThe dog may be scared and will struggle. If this is the case, try feeding the dog immediately after the nail trim so that it sees its food as a reward for good behavior.\nMany Maltese owners trim their dog's nails when the dog is asleep. However, you need to be very careful or it could really startle the dog awake.\n\n, This can be done professionally, but can also be done at home. Go into the outer ears with a Q-tip, but do not stick it into the inner ear. Just use it to clean the visible part of the ear. If there is wax of any sort, be sure to clean it out.\n\n\nNever put water into the dog's ears, as this softens the skin and makes it more likely to become infected. Instead, use an ear cleaner sold for the purpose. These are designed to dissolve wax and also for an excess to evaporate away, so the ear canal is not left over wet.\n\n, The Maltese has a small stomach, so choose a premium food that is high quality. Take your vet's recommendation and also look for a food that has a named meat listed as the main ingredient.\n\n, Feed him a high quality dog food and treats recommended by your vet. Always have fresh water and dry kibble available for your Maltese (unless the animal is an adult and is overweight). Maltese puppies can suffer from hypoglycemia, which can be life threatening, if food is not readily available.\n\n, It may be that you are giving the dog too much food at meal time or that you are giving too many treats. Consult with your vet if your Maltese is putting on too much weight.He or she may have a suggestions for helping the dog lose weight.\n\n, A Maltese, like all dogs, needs to be well socialized in order to become a well-rounded dog. While it is important to bond with your pup, its also important that the dog is open to meeting new people and animals. Expose your puppy to a wide variety of people and animals when it is young, so that it understands that this is a normal and enjoyable part of life.Maltese dogs that are not socialized can become either fearful or aggressive toward strangers.\n\n, Although Maltese are good apartment dwellers and don't require a great deal of exercise, it is important for the dog's brain, socialization, sensory system, and enjoyment to get out. Even a fifteen to twenty minute walk can be a nice break for you and your dog.Maltese are adaptable when it comes to exercise. They enjoy walks but are also happy to burn energy in a restricted space, by playing games of fetch. Teach your Maltese not to jump off your bed or couch, though, as this can cause injury. The breed is vulnerable to knee injuries (luxating patellas).\nBe aware that a bored Maltese may turn to barking to amuse itself.\n\n, The Maltese is an intelligent dog and loves to be stimulated mentally. Like all dogs, your Maltese needs to be trained to sit, stay, and come when called, in addition to being potty trained. Use positive reinforcement when training, as opposed to punishment when the dog does something wrong. These dogs respond much better to treats and love as incentive to do the right thing.\n\n\nDon't be fooled by their small size, they love the mental challenge of training. Indeed, some Maltese excel at agility training, albeit on a small scale, so don't write this off as an activity for your dog.\n\n, Maltese dogs are beautiful animals that deserve to be treated with love and care. Snuggle with your pup often and show it that you care for it.\n\n, Your veterinarian will be able to advise you as to which diseases are prevalent in the area, and which it is necessary to vaccinate against. Some states also require all pets to be vaccinated against rabies, in which case you must comply.\n\n\nTake your veterinarian's advice on preventative healthcare such as heartworm, and regular worming treatments and use them regularly., If your dog is a pet and not intended for breeding, then speak to your vet about desexing. This helps reduce antisocial behaviors, such as territory marking in the male. It also reduces the risk of certain diseases in the female, such as mammary cancer (if done before the second season) and pyometra (womb infection).\n\n, This is a permanent way of identifying the dog as yours. Should it escape or be stolen, the ID chip allows you to prove ownership, and will help someone who finds your dog locate you (vets can read the chip and find you through the registry).\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":886}

S. President and his office. Blame the White House for running the government badly.\nThe ones who criticize the U. S. President for creating the deficits.\n\nThe president proposes spending and the budget. He cannot vote for the laws or funds or force the Congress -- who does vote them up or down -- to accept his plans and\/or budgets.\n\n\n\n,\nIt's their fiscal policy (taxes and spending). Congress sets that fiscal policy; plus they oversee and can indirectly influence or control monetary policy which is set by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n, That 545 excludes the members of the Federal Reserve Board which was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency off onto a federally chartered, but private, central bank.\nThat also excludes the special interests like organizations and lobbyists. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a president to do one thing. If they offer a politician a large contribution to vote for their ideas -- the politician has the power to accept or reject it. But, no matter what the lobbyists promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.;\n, If there is are unfair taxes: blame congress.\nUnfair red ink (overspending) is because they don't \"put the budget in the black\". Your taxes and fees have to pay for their decision, good or indiscretion.\nWars, and undeclared wars -- when the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines are engaged it is because \"the majority of the 545 allow that\". Whether politicians are acceptable rests upon their power to declare war, and to rule on the way it is done. Of course, wars cost money and lives.\nVery high retirement checks for the 545 are because \"they setup their perks\" that way or do not object loudly enough.\n\n, This supreme law of the land gives sole responsibility to the U. S. House of Representatives for originating taxes and spending (appropriations) bills. If the senate originates them, the House will not accept that. The speaker of the House who handles coordinating this responsibility is elected by House colleagues as the leader of the majority party in the House. The Senate can make changes and then it has to be agreed between the two.\n\n\nThe Speaker and fellow House members, not the president, can approve any budget that they want. If the president vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to with a 2\/3 vote of the members.\n\n, Complex domestic problem solutions and failings are largely traceable to those 545 people. Consider:\n\n\nWorking through the ballot box by helping your candidates and voting for your ideals.\nWriting letters to officials, editors,...\nCalling talk shows on radio and TV: hold news and television shows accountable for not exposing bad policies that are not exposed.\n\n,,, These cannot prevent their trying to do what they took their oath to do.\n\n, They can be held accountable by you as one of their individual bosses.\n\n, Working together you can vote great numbers of them out of office and clean up their messes.\n\n, You're it!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":889}
{"text":" Have the other person acting as a base do this, too. This will form a platform, in a square shape, for the flyer to stand on and catapult off of.\n\n\nGrab your own wrist and their wrist just below the wrist bones. Keep your grip loose and flexible. Too much rigidity will keep the toss from going anywhere. Adjust as necessary until you two feel comfortable.;\n, Keep your hips over your toes and your feet a little more than shoulder width apart. Always keep your back straight! If you don\u2019t, you could injure yourself.\n\n\nMake yourself the height of the other base, if possible, by widening your stance (or having them widen theirs). The best pairs of bases are roughly the same height. What\u2019s more, the taller you are, the easier it will be to hoist the flyer higher into the air \u2013 don't compromise height if you don't have to.\n\n, When you\u2019re practicing, take the time to make sure the flyer feels secure. Are her hands nestled into the crick of your neck and do they feel sturdy? How is her right foot placed on your hands? Is it centered? This initial stage is very important to the success of the stunt.\n\n\nDo plenty of basket drills before you go up in the actual stunt. Essentially, all you do is set up the flyer and stop when her feet touch your hands. If, in that position, her hands and feet are sturdy, centered, and secure, you're doing it right. Try to limit the time it takes to make the process as fluid as possible.\n\n, The flyer sets up the stunt with her right foot on your hands and her hands on your shoulder. Then, the backspot is going to help hoist her whole body onto your wrists and hands. As her left foot touches down too (that's all her weight now), bend down slightly as if you\u2019re starting a slingshot.\n\n\nThere should be no jerky movements in this stunt. You and your base partner simply bend your knees and your arms lower with the rest of your body and her to accommodate her weight. It is one giant, slingshot motion.\nIf you are jerky, do a practice drill. Do everything up until this point, and then mimic like you\u2019re going to throw her into the air, stopping much before you actually would. This will help all of you get the timing of it.\n\n, Straighten your legs and throw your arms up, giving the flyer as much height as possible using all of your body. Release the other base\u2019s wrists as soon as you feel them moving away \u2013 don\u2019t hold on. With a little flick of the wrists, she's into the air.\n\n\nThe more oomph you put behind this movement, the more you use your entire body, the higher she is going to fly. As you\u2019re dipping down with the placement of her left foot, take the power from your feet and drive it upward.\nYou can even jump a little bit, adding even more height to your basket. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re 70 inches (177.8\u00a0cm) tall, with a thrust of 48 inches (121.9\u00a0cm). That\u2019s a basket toss that\u2019s 118 inches (299.7\u00a0cm) high. With a jump, it becomes 122 inches (309.9\u00a0cm) \u2013 and it all adds up! Each inch more is that much more impressive.\n\n, She may move in the air and you\u2019ll have to follow her below. If you threw her to the right or left (like a human bowling ball), you're going to have to catch her to the right or left.\n\n\nOf course, ideally, you throw her straight up, plant your feet, and she comes directly back down \u2013 you should barely have to move an inch. But if that doesn't happen, adjust your positioning to catch her.\n\n, Make sure to stay in front of the other base at all times \u2013 you two should move as one. You'll be on one side of the flyer and the other base on the other. The flyer's arms should land around your neck.\n\n\nAbsorb her body weight as she comes down, bending your arms and knees as she lands into your makeshift cradle. Aim for one arm around her back and one around her knees.\n\n, To dismount, you have two options:\n\n\nFrom your dip, simply hoist her in front of you, slightly lowering your arm around her knees and pushing your arm around her back forward. She should then be easily able to stand just in front of you.\nFrom your dip, bounce her back up to where her feet can land in your hands again, and move onto a different stunt right away \u2013 another basket toss or elevator perhaps?\n\n, Do whichever feels more comfortable for you. For most girls, nestling your hands in the crick of the bases\u2019 necks feels the most secure. Your thumb should be on their collarbone and your fingers towards their back.\n\n\nMake sure you feel sturdy. If you don\u2019t, adjust. Don't worry about hurting or strangling the bases \u2013 you definitely won't.\n\n, Their wrists are interwoven to provide you with a platform to step up. Rest your right foot on the right side of the platform in preparation for the stunt. This is your starting position.\n\n\nWhen you're ready, the backspot will count off for you, cuing you for each movement. On cue, she will hoist you up to put your left foot on the platform, too. You will be in a crouching position.\n\n, Put all your weight in your arms, taking the weight off the bases' hands. This will help send your body skyrocketing, allowing you to propel yourself, in addition to the bases providing you that effortless power.\n\n\nDon\u2019t jump. You want contact for as long as possible to rev up and gain velocity. If you do jump, odds are your jump will be slightly off the timing of the bases, which will result in a choppy, unpowerful lurch into the air.\n\n, You should mainly contact the bases\u2019 hands with the balls of your feet \u2013 this helps you act as a spring instead of a dead weight that has to be hoisted into the air. It's also easier to point your toes from this position.\n\n\nThink of how you jump. Do you jump flat-footed? Probably not. When you're crouching on their hands, make sure the balls of your feet are where the brunt of the action is taking place, so you can lift off from there.\n\n, When you feel the bases propelling you upwards and your feet are about to leave their hands, pull yourself up. While airborne, keep your back straight and legs locked out, so that your body is in a straight line. It should feel as if a cord is pulling your entire body along an even plane.\n\n\nYou should remain in this position until you reach the peak of the toss. At that point you can hit a motion or do a trick.You want it to look as clean as possible from beginning to end.\nKeep your legs and hands tucked in so you don\u2019t hurt those on the ground as you go up. A flailing arm or leg can do some serious damage.\n\n, During a straight ride, put your arms straight in the air or in a high V and keep your legs straight. Point your toes and that\u2019s it!\n\n\nA few options other than a straight ride are a toe touch, kick-arch, pretty woman, back tuck, full tuck, and many more. The higher you get into the air, the easier a trick will be (the more time you'll have to do it).\n\n, Aside from the normal basket toss, a toe touch is the most common add-on. Do as you would normally do for a traditional basket, but instead of coming down riding up as a layout you will add a quick toe touch.\n\n\nRide up as high as you can then quickly pull a toe touch, keeping your back straight. When pulling back into a layout then v shape, snap down from your toe touch quickly, it will look much cleaner than slowly coming down to your final positions.\nYou also won't have that much time to get into your layout\/v sit so snapping down will give plenty of time to land in the bases arms.\n\n, Keep your arms up in order to wrap around the necks of your bases when you land (and to avoid knocking them in the head when you do). To pike, bring your toes up toward you (still pointed!), putting your body in a slight curve to be cradled.\n\n\nAs long as you don't flail about and stay relaxed, it will be easy to catch you. Don't worry! At the very least, you'll land on them and they'll break your fall!\n\n, This is a very complicated move to pull in a basket toss so practice the less complicated moves first. The whole back flip will be completed in one motion, so there's no snap down into the cradle.\n\n\nOnce you feel yourself leaving the bases arms, start to rotate into your back flip, keep in mind most people don't grab their knees or tuck in the back flip.\nMost people come around piked, this makes it a lot easier to land in a V shape when you are caught.\n\n, Once you\u2019re cradled, the bases will bend down and place you gently on the ground (or they should if all has gone correctly). You can then resume the cheer from the safety of your own two feet.\n\n\nOr go back into a stunt. From a cradle, the bases can bend once again, and on the upward bounce you pull your feet in \u2013 they can then rest in the bases\u2019 hands, ready for the next basket toss or elevator.\n\n, Make sure you have a firm grip on her and can\u2019t slide on her shirt, shorts, or skirt. If you need to, make skin-to-skin contact to be sure.\n\n\nAlways be a bit tighter than you think you need to be. You are not running the risk of hurting the flyer or impeding the stunt if you're holding on tightly. In fact, that way you can give her more power.\n\n, You time the stunt, keeping everyone in sync.\n\n\nFor an eight count, \u201c1, 2\u201d should be the team getting into position. On \u201c3,4\u201d the bases bend their knees and the flyer lifts her right foot into their hands. On \u201c5,6\u201d the flyer loads in her left foot and the rest of her body and the team dips down. On \u201c7,8\u201d she is thrusted upward into the air.\nWith everyone in position, instead, you can count, \u201c1\u201d for the flyer putting in her right foot. \u201c2\u201d for her left foot, \u201cdown\u201d for the dip, and \u201cup!\u201d for throwing her into the air.\n\n, You have the ability to put the flyer exactly where she needs to be placed \u2013 on the center of the platform the bases are making with their wrists. Make sure she's in the right spot for lift off.\n\n\nYou are also the reason she can get into their hands in the first place. Without a boost from you, she won't even be able to get off the ground. Use your legs to hoist her into position and to put you into position for throwing her upwards.\n\n, Straighten your legs, using them for power, to give her that initial thrust. With your hands still on her hips, drive her up into the air, breaking contact when you feel her moving away from you.\n\n\nMake sure to throw her straight up so she doesn't curve to the left, right, backwards, or forwards. Your hands guide her direction more than anyone else's.\n\n, Sometimes the flyer doesn\u2019t go straight up into the air and instead moves off in a different direction entirely. This is either because her weight was unevenly distributed or because she was veered into another direction by you or base propelling unequally. Because of this, it\u2019s incredibly important to watch her so you can adjust your placement to catch her.\n\n\nFollow the bases, staying slightly behind them. You'll be catching her arms, back, and neck.\n\n, The bases will be in front of you, catching her around her torso and legs, off to her side. You are behind her, catching her by her armpits \u2013 her arms will be wrapped around the bases\u2019 necks.\n\nMake fists with your hands, so you don't end up slapping or poking the flyer or the bases. Your arms should jut out in front of you as you see her coming down, but your elbows should be relaxed. No one's body, including yours, should be rigid.\n\n, You have two options:\n\nThe bases will lower their arms around her legs, and she will go onto the ground. All you have to do is give her a little nudge forward with your forearms and then move out of the way.\nIf she goes up into another stunt immediately, use your arms to hoist her up to where she can place her feet back into the bases hands. Immediately move your hands back onto her waist and send her up into another toss or an elevator.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":890}
{"text":" It's good to have both a general regional guide, as well as a more specific guide for your area. You can never have enough field guides - the more images you have the easier it will be to identify a particular tree. Field guides can be obtained for free at your local library. Used bookstores can be another good source, where guides can be bought at about half the price. Another great resource is a plant identification terminology book. This will help you understand the language in the guide. If you're just starting out, focus on using mostly photos of leaves and bark and flowers and fruit to identify trees. Then move on to using keys and drawings, which are more technical and precise. Various guides can also provide fascinating anecdotal information about different trees.;\n, Anything planted in a garden, lawn, roadside, park, is often an ornamental. Ornamentals are garden varieties of native species that are dissimilar enough to throw you off, and make pinpointing an exact species very difficult. If you want to learn your area ornamentals, there are many guides for the horticulturist about planting and growing trees that will have enough images that you might just find your tree. There are not that many different native trees in a specific area, and they are easy to learn. But if you include the city ornamentals, you're talking up to a thousand trees planted from all over the world.\n\n, If you have the time to sit at the base of a tree you want to learn, and pore over field guides - great. Identification takes a lot of patience and concentration. It may take at least 30 minutes of studying various guides before you've found it. If you cannot sit with the tree, take some photos and samples home with you.\n\n, Pick a tree that has at least one, if not two easily identifiable characteristics - such as a leaf or flower or fruit. Bark is not so easy to go by, nor buds, or scars, or growth habit. Leaves are the easiest to use. Start with an evergreen. There are very few native evergreen broad-leaved trees in the U.S. This magnolia with its large glossy evergreen leaves in the South is a dead giveaway:\n\n, The tulip tree with its huge vertical trunk and papery upright flowers, that remain all through the winter, is very common and easy to identify (the 'flowers' are the remains of the fruit axis, not actually blooms). It gives the tree a candelabra effect.\n\n,, A peach, a cherry, a plum, a hawthorn, a juneberry, a pear, are all in the same family, with edible fruit - the rose. Trees with pods are in the legume, (or bean) family, such as silk tree, mesquite and locust. There are not that many different tree families in any temperate region of the world - if you can group your trees in their respective families you'll be better able to understand them, and know their characteristics. Beech and oak and chestnut are all in the same family (the beech), and produce edible nuts. Cottonwood is really a gigantic member of the willow family, growing beside water and having deeply fissured bark, just like other willows.\n\n\nAnd the tulip tree is in the magnolia family - it has large showy flowers, just like magnolia, and look at a comparison of the fruit:\n\n, Hackberries are in the elm family, and both the seed and flesh of the prolific berries is edible - they're much like candy, and can persist on the tree deep into winter in some varieties and locales:\n\n\nOr the flaky peeling bark of this river birch:\n\n, The scarlet flowers stand out beautifully against the smooth gray bark. Red maple's twigs are also red. Its red keys typically don't last that far into winter:\n\n,, . . there are also old woody capsules from the previous year's fruit:\n\n,, . . and often holding on to their cones, such as the tiny 1\/2\" cones on this hemlock:\n\n, There's an incredible amount of information about various tree species online, as well as lots of images - you should arrive at a dead certainty about the identification of your tree at this point. You will also find a wealth of anecdotal information, as well as what possible uses the tree has and any toxic or edible parts. Always cross-reference and verify from multiple sources the edibility of a certain tree - don't go by one opinion alone. That having been said, there are very few trees in the U.S. that are actually poisonous, such as buckeye and yew.\n\n, Ultimately you'll create your own database of area trees, and become an expert. It will become an excellent reference source for you year after year, and you will come to know your trees from all angles, in all habitats, in all seasons.\n\n, This is a great project for kids, and it spurs their interest in trees.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":891}

{"text":" Federal law requires the college to provide you with a list of required textbooks once you register for classes, so you should be able to find out which books you need well in advance from either the registrar or your professors. You should not need to rely on the campus bookstore to tell you.;\n, You might be able to find the occasional good deal at your campus bookstore, but in the vast majority of cases, you can find the books you need for a much lower cost somewhere online.Check out websites like BIG WORDS.com and Campus books.com, both of which direct you toward textbook sellers offering the lowest prices.\nAlso check out websites that allow users to sell their own used and new copies of a book, like Amazon or Half.com.\n\n, For many textbooks, you can buy an old edition at a lower price without facing too much difficulty.\n\n\nYou might want to check with your professors before doing this, however, in the rare instance that there is a significant change in the new edition that you will need access to in order to survive the class.\n\n, Renting your textbooks will not guarantee a lower price tag, but oftentimes, the price to rent a book will be cheaper than the price to buy. Look into both options and determine which will work best for any particular book.\n\n\nYou can check your campus bookstore for renting opportunities, but there are also online sources, including Chegg, BookRenter.com, CampusBookRental.com, and ValoreBooks.\n\n, If you really want to pinch pennies, you can check for coupons that allow you to save money on textbooks bought online. These coupons will rarely be specific to the publisher, but you might be able to find coupons for various online stores.\n\n, If you know a friend who needs to buy some of the same textbooks, consider splitting the cost in half with that friend and sharing the book.\n\n, Upperclassmen who are done with a textbook for good will occasionally sell it, and the cost is usually pretty cheap since they tend to be more interested in making whatever they can on the book.\n\n, As long as the international edition is printed in the same language, this can be a viable option. Research carefully, however, since international editions can go either way in terms of cost.\n\n\nCheck the cost of shipping, as well, since shipping costs on international editions can sometimes cause the overall price of the book to shoot up.\n\n, Even if you plan to do most of your work on your computer, you still need a range of basic writing utensils for class time and study time.\n\n\nBuy blue or black ball-point pens and pencils for taking notes and filling in exam papers.\nGet highlighters to help you study.\nInvest in a couple of permanent markers and a bottle of white-out., Folders and notebooks are essentials, but there are a few other supplies that could come in handy that may not be quite as obvious.\n\n\nConsider buying a three-ring binder and a hole punch to help you stay organized, as well as subject dividers and loose-leaf paper.\nBuy a book bag or messenger bag that you can carry from class to class.\n\n, The desk in your dorm room will need to hold a large number of supplies and papers, so buy tools and supplies that can help you keep everything in order\u2014including your sanity.\n\n\nConsider buying:\nSticky notes\nPersonal organizer or calender\nDictionary and thesaurus\nCalculator\nRubber bands, a ruler, scissors, a stapler and staples, thumbtacks, and tape\n\n, If you do not have one already, you should really consider buying a computer. Most of your classes will require you to type and print papers, and a computer can also help you with research and entertainment.\n\n\nAside from a computer, check into buying:\n\nPrinter\nPrinter paper\nInk cartridges\nFlash drive\n\n\nFind out if your campus has computer labs equipped with printers. If so, you might be able to skip the printer and save yourself the cost.\nProtect your tech. Buy surge protectors to protect your computer from any unexpected electrical surges. You can also consider buying an external hard drive so you can periodically back up the contents of your hard drive.\n\n, Most dorm rooms are equipped with extra-long twin beds, so when you buy comforters and sheets, you should make sure that the size of the bedding you buy will match the size of the bed you will have.\n\n\nYou will need pillows and pillowcases, bed sheets, a blanket, and a quilt or comforter.\nAlso consider buying a mattress pad to make your bed more comfortable.\n\n, Many dorm rooms are equipped with some form of lighting and mirrors, but it usually will not hurt to buy a few of these yourself.\n\n\nIf your dorm does not come with one, buy a full-length mirror.\nConsider buying a desk lamp and floor lamp to supplement the overhead lighting installed in the room.\n\n, An alarm clock is an absolute must, unless you have an alarm on your cell phone that you rely on. Even if you do use your cell phone alarm, having a backup alarm clock can still be a good idea.\n\n\nYou should also buy supplies that can help you fall asleep faster so that you can wake up well-rested. These may include earplugs and an eye mask.\n\n, Odds are, you can just bring the same clothes you wore throughout your high school years. There might be a few instances in which you will want or need to buy new clothes.\n\n\nPrepare for bad weather. Have a raincoat, rain boots, umbrella, and snow boots, as needed.\nIf the climate you are moving to differs from the climate back home, buy clothes that are more suited toward the climate you'll be heading to.\n\n, Some items you need to bring with you will not stay out once you get to campus, so you should buy a few storage bins to help you store any excess materials until you need them.\n\n\nAlso consider buying temporary racks and shelving to store shoes, books, and other belongings that you need to access easily.\n\n, While this is not a necessity, you should consider buying things to decorate your walls and door. This is the room you will be living in for the majority of the year, after all, so you'll want it to be comfortable for you.\n\n\nOptions worth considering include:\n\nBulletin board\nPosters\nDry-erase message board and pens for your door\n\n\n\n, If you have never owned your own suitcases, now is the time to buy a set. Purchasing your luggage in sets is recommended over purchasing it piece by piece, since a set will usually provide you with the best deal for your money.\n\n, You will need a large bath towel and small washcloth, at minimum, but there are also a few other shower-related items you should look into buying.Purchase sandals or shower shoes to protect your feet from the bacteria left behind in communal showers.\nBuy shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.\nIf your room has its own bathroom, buy hand towels, a bath mat, and toilet paper.\nBring a shower caddy to store your soaps and other supplies.\n\n, As a general guideline, any product or tool you use at home should be brought with you to college. If you were using your parents' supplies at home, you need to buy your own, now.\n\n\nBuy a hair dryer, flat iron, brush, comb, and curling iron, as needed.\nAlso consider buying a razor and shaving cream to take care of facial and\/or body hair.\n\n, As with hair care products, any skin care product you use at home will also need to be purchased for college.\n\n\nProtect your skin with moisturizing lotion and sunscreen.\nKeep your teeth clean with your own toothbrush and toothpaste.\nBuy a new tube of lip balm.\nKeep body odor in check with deodorant.\n\n, A first aid kit is a good idea for any college kid. You can buy a commercially-prepared first aid kit or buy the supplies separately.\n\n\nSupplies worth including are:\n\nRubbing alcohol\nAntibacterial ointment\nAdhesive bandages\nHydrogen peroxide\nThermometer\n\n\n\n, Aside from a first aid kit, there are a few other items you should consider having in case you get sick or otherwise feel less than your best.\n\n\nA few items worth buying include:\n\nOver-the-counter headache medicine, cold medicine, and allergy medicine\nPrescription medications\nCough drops\nEye drops\n\n\n\n, In many cases, you will only need to worry about cleaning your bedroom or dorm room. In some cases, however, you might also be responsible for the dorm hallways, bathroom, or kitchen area, in which instance, you will need to buy cleaning supplies for these areas, as well.\n\n, A vacuum cleaner, broom, and mop should all be on your college shopping list.\n\n\nInvest in a mini-vacuum cleaner, especially if you are only in charge of a small space like your dorm room.\n\n, You will almost always need to wash your own clothes. Stock up on laundry detergent and invest in a hamper.\n\n\nBuy a collapsible hamper to save room.\nPurchase fabric softener in either liquid or dry sheet form.\n\n, Disinfectant wipes are advisable, regardless of how much you will be expected to clean. Having disinfectant wipes and sprays can help reduce the spread of germs, which is very important in a compact space like a dorm room.\n\n\nAlso bring along dish soap and glass cleaner, as well as clean rags that can be used for scrubbing.\n\n, Even the most studious college student will need to unwind every now and then. Now is as good an excuse as any to stock up on any CDs, DVDs, or Blu-rays you've had your eye on.\n\n\nSkip the fancy sound systems, though, since you can get in trouble if you make too much noise and your neighbors file a complaint.\nAlso buy a small TV to watch your movies on.\n\n, You might love your music, but that does not mean your roommate or your neighbors will love it as much as you do. Headphones are important, so if you do not own any, buy them now.\n\n\nIf you invest in noise-canceling headphones, you can also shield your ears from the music and sounds made by other people.\n\n, If you enjoy reading, purchase a few books you can look forward to reading. Doing so can restore some of the joy of reading that might otherwise get lost amidst all the textbook work.\n\n, Indoor and outdoor games can help you relieve stress and make friends, so if you do not have any games you can bring along with you to college, buy one or two now.\n\n\nBoard games and card games are a great, inexpensive option. You can also bring a video game console, but do so at your own risk, since this could be stolen if you leave your room unlocked and unattended.\nBuy supplies for outdoor fun, too, like rollerblades, a frisbee, or a basketball.\n\n, Many colleges have restrictions regarding the types of cooking instruments you are allowed to keep in your dorm room. Review these restrictions before making any big purchases.\n\n\nItems you should check on before buying include:\n\nCoffee maker\nBlender\nMicrowave\nSmall refrigerator\n\n\n\n, Resealable plastic bins and plastic bags are important since they allow you to store leftovers and make your food supply last longer.\n\n\nMake sure that your plastic bins are microwave-safe.\n\n, Forks, knives, and spoons are the absolute essentials you need to stock up on, so buy these supplies before you head off to college.\n\n\nYou should also consider buying a can opener, funnel, and any cooking utensils (like whisks and mixing spoons) you might need if you plan to prepare your own food.\nCooking supplies also include baking pans, saucepans, and frying pans.\n\n, You will also need plates, bowls, cups, and mugs when you head off to college.\n\n\nMake sure that your dishes are microwave-safe.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":893}

If your website is listed in as many places as possible, it can boost your rankings in major search engines as well.;\n,,, Contact the owners of other websites with your proposal to exchange links. You will add their link to your links page, and they will link to your website in return.\n\n, Visit the online discussion forums where people in your target market like to gather.

Your comment and your link will permanently remain on the blog website.\n\n, Set your e-mail program to automatically add your signature to every e-mail that you send.\n\n, There are many types of traffic exchanges but the idea is the same - you team up with other webmasters, and they send you traffic in exchange for you sending them traffic.

How's that for a free publicity?\n\n, The point of keywords is that they are the terms most people looking for your article by topic will search by. Check those with free Google terms and use the most popular relevant one in your title - a descriptive title to let them know right away what it is if it's a word with multiple meanings. Drawing blood for a phlebotomist is not the same thing as a comics artist drawing blood in a fight scene.

{"text":" Don\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re shy, there\u2019s something wrong with you. Your partner chose you because they liked your personality, and your shyness is part of that. Even if it\u2019s something you want to work on for your own sake in the relationship, never forget that you can be confident and powerful even if you\u2019re shy.\n\n\nNever apologize for being shy. Explain why you\u2019re reacting the way you are, say that you\u2019re working on it because you want to, but never give anyone the impression that you owe them extroversion.;\n, Studies have shown that discussing your shyness-related anxiety can lessen the effects of it,and experts suggest that showing vulnerability is actually a good way to increase trust and intimacy between partners.Especially in new relationships, it's very important to have a conversation about your shyness at the outset; this will pave the way for easier conversations down the road that will make your relationship a lasting one. There\u2019s certainly nothing to be ashamed of, so be open and honest about how you\u2019re feeling when you feel yourself tensing up.\n\n\nDon\u2019t bottle up your nervous feelings to deal with them later.\nTell your partner how you\u2019re feeling in real time.\nDon\u2019t dwell on your shyness; get it out in the open, then move on to another subject when the feeling passes.\nLet your partner comfort you if they try.\n\n, Instead of trying to connect with your boyfriend or girlfriend all the time, take enough time with yourself and with the friends and family you feel comfortable with to keep yourself happy. When you're happier, your relationship will have a better chance of working out.\n\n, Many shy people find that it's face-to-face interactions that cause them the most anxiety, but that they can communicate by text or on the internet more comfortably.Most new couples don't spend all their time together anyway, so keep in touch through texting, Facebook, Twitter, and other methods of communication that will let you establish a relationship and get to know each other without all the anxiety of seeing the person in the flesh.\n\n,\n\n\nAsk a platonic friend or relative who you're very comfortable with to go on a \u201cdate\u201d with you.\nGo through all the steps: get dressed up, pick them up\/have them pick you up, go to a restaurant and have a nice conversation.\nFamiliarize yourself with the dating context, and try to remember that it\u2019s all old hat when you\u2019re on a real date with your partner.\n\n, For example, you have to open up about your hopes and dreams, your fears and shames, and how you feel about your partner when you're first getting to know each other. Plan out the big conversations that you think you\u2019ll probably have with your partner ahead of time, so that you\u2019ll be ready for them when they come up. Having a sort of script prepared in your head will make it much easier for you to open up.\n\n\nMake lists of your fears, hopes, and other important feelings.\nIf you need to have an argument, outline the rationale behind your side of the argument. Anticipate what your partner will say, as well. The better prepared you are for all possible routes of conversation, the more open and effective you\u2019ll be as a communicator.\n\n, If you can\u2019t ever think of anything to say to your partner, then do a little bit of work when you\u2019re alone to fix that situation. Watch the news, read books and magazines, and keep up on pop culture that you have in common \u2014 whether music, movies, or graphic novels \u2014 to ensure that you always have something new to bring up when you\u2019re together.\n\n, These \u201cactivities\u201d might be as simple as accepting a phone call immediately instead of waiting for it to go to voicemail and calling back.\n\n\nPush yourself gently but surely into situations that put you outside of your comfort zone.\nDon\u2019t rush yourself! Start small and work your way up to taking bigger steps, like spontaneous romantic vacations.\n\n, If a romantic setting like a fancy dinner makes you nervous, then lower the bar. Go on a date where you won\u2019t feel so much pressure to make a one-on-one connection, but can enjoy yourselves together in a more public setting. Depending on what your interests are, you might go to:\n\n\nA sporting event where you can be among a crowd\nA museum, where you can discuss the exhibits rather than personal details\nA movie or theatrical production, where you can spend time together without speaking\n\n, That can be very stressful for a shy person! If you feel yourself tensing up around your partner, do a simple relaxation exercise to calm yourself down and put you in a better frame of mind.\n\n\nTake a deep breath and hold it for a count of four, then exhale, controlling your breath on the way out.\nRepeat until you\u2019ve overcome your anxiety.\n\n,\n\n\nThe eyes are an important tool for communication, so rushing into a lot of eye contact might feel draining.\nOver time, practice making eye contact more and more frequently, and for longer periods of time.\nPractice on pictures and images on the TV, or with your parents if looking into your partner\u2019s eyes is too intimidating at first.\nLooking anywhere in the vicinity of your partner\u2019s eyes will still be comforting to them, even if you\u2019re not making direct eye contact.\nIt\u2019s easier to make eye contact when you\u2019re listening than when you\u2019re speaking, so start with the easy stuff.\n\n, Make a conscious decision to keep your body open.\n\n\nLet your hands sit at your sides.\nPush your shoulders back and your chest forward.\n\n, Even if you\u2019re not terribly talkative because of your shyness, that doesn\u2019t mean your partner needs to feel alone when they\u2019re speaking with you. You can engage nonverbally in a conversation simply by registering the same emotions the speaker\u2019s having in a given moment.\n\n\nIf your partner smiles or laughs, you should smile or laugh along.\nIf they\u2019re discussing something concerning, register their worry on your face.\nThis will ensure your partner that you\u2019re still engaged with them, not withdrawn into your own world.\n\n, Some ways to nonverbally engage in a communication include:\n\n\nSmiling or laughing at appropriate moments\nMaintaining eye contact\nNodding along\n\n, By leaning forward and closing the distance between you, you\u2019ll create a more intimate, secure mood in your relationship.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":895}
{"text":" Blogs fall into various large categories, and considering some of these categories can help you narrow down your interests. Remember: for you to make money, people have to read your blog. Here are some popular blog genres:Personal blogs. Successful personal blogs almost give readers the impression that they know you. They can feel like a lunchtime chat with the blogger, or an insight into their daily life. If you are good at expressing your personality online, this could be a good genre for you.\n\nFor a good example, see \u201cThe Bloggess,\u201d a blog that provides a humorous and entertaining look into the daily life of a woman with social anxiety.Special Interest Blogs. These blogs can offer tips and tricks about your favorite hobby. They can share knowledge about a topic you\u2019re passionate about. These work especially well if you have a unique perspective you can bring to your topic.\n\nFor a good example, see \u201cCurly Nikki,\u201d a blog by a Black woman who is passionate about helping other women learn to love their natural hair.Another good example is the famous \u201cPerez Hilton,\u201d a phenomenally successful celebrity gossip blog focused on dishing the dirt about famous people.Industry Blogs. These are specialized to a particular field or industry. They\u2019re a good choice if you\u2019re already an expert on something and want to share that expertise. Because you have to constantly stay on top of new information and developments in that industry, you need to make sure you\u2019re comfortable with researching and understanding your topic.\n\nFor a good example, see \u201cThe Copybot,\u201d a marketing blog by copywriter Damien Farnworth. He tackles how to write the best copy for online sites with lots of concrete examples and helpful lists.Political Blogs. If you have an informed perspective on politics you\u2019d like to share, or you want to communicate your political views in an interesting, entertaining way, a political blog could be a good choice for you. Political blogs often take a particular \u201cside,\u201d but they don\u2019t have to.\n\nFor example, \u201cPolitiFact.com\u201d (a Pulitzer Prize-winning blog owned by the Tampa Bay Times) runs fact checks on important news stories of the day, assigning them a \u201ctruth meter\u201d rating that helpfully breaks down inaccuracies in news reporting.Another example of a political blog is \u201cMichelle Malkin,\u201d a blog run by conservative pundit Michelle Malkin. This blog states the blogger\u2019s personal political opinions in an engaging way.;\n, The best blogs focus on topics that you, the blogger, are passionate about. This topic can be anything that you believe you have enough to say about to interest others. It works best if you can find a \u201cniche\u201d that is not being fully exploited.There are several important things to keep in mind when choosing your blog topic:Who is your audience? There are millions and millions of blogs in the world, so it\u2019s crucial that you know exactly who your target audience is so you can draw them in.\nWhat does that audience want? For example, if you\u2019ve decided your audience is \u201cstay at home moms,\u201d you\u2019ll need to consider the possible interests and needs of that demographic. Make sure you don\u2019t just make assumptions. Look at other blogs that cater to your audience to see what they\u2019re delivering.\nHow qualified are you? Good blogs convey a sense of familiarity and ease with the material. Excellent blogs usually have bloggers who are personally qualified to talk about their topics. If you can\u2019t think of at least 25 separate posts off the top of your head about your topic, you may not have enough familiarity with the topic to keep your content going.\nHow sustainable is the topic? Make sure that you choose a topic that is likely to stay relevant in the future. You also need to be able to come up with new items to blog about on a very frequent basis. For this reason, try to avoid a topic that\u2019s too narrow -- you\u2019ll run out of things to say.\nHow much competition do you have? Do some research to determine what already exists about your topic. \u201cCelebrity gossip\u201d is a hugely popular topic, but there\u2019s also a lot of existing competition that could mean your blog gets lost.\nWhat is your \u201dspin\u201d? To set yourself apart from the crowd, you\u2019ll need to do something different and interesting with your content. Will you have an interactive focus? Focus on bizarre day-to-day news events instead of celebrity dish? Whatever you choose to blog about, make sure that you have ways to approach it creatively and that you can consistently offer new, exciting content.\n\n, Your blog can be about anything, but once you have decided your general area of interest, such as \u201ccelebrities\u201d or \u201cparenting,\u201d visit several popular blogs to see what they do. Pay attention to their blog design, what they blog about\n\n\nFor example, the blog \u201cTom + Lorenzo: Fabulous & Opinionated\u201d began as a small blog recapping and critiquing episodes of Project Runway -- meaning that it had a built-in audience and clear purpose from the start. It\u2019s grown into a pop culture site with millions of readers offering TV and movie reviews, fashion critiques, and celebrity news.An excellent example of a successful personal blog is \u201cThe Pioneer Woman,\u201d a three-time Bloggie award winner. The blogger, Ree Drummond, now has her own show on the Food Network because of the attractive, \u201cdown-home\u201d way she presents her recipes and lifestyle anecdotes.Three-time Bloggie award-winner \u201cCamels and Chocolate\u201d documents the travel experiences of a journalist, Kristin Luna, and her husband. Her accessible tone and beautiful photographs, coupled with her skill in telling a \u201cstory\u201d about her trips, make it feel like the reader is on the trip with her.\nBlogs can also take on a very particular, quirky lens. For example, \u201cCrusoe the Celebrity Dachshund\u201d won a 2014 Bloggie award. The blog is written as though Crusoe himself is writing it, and readers related to the lovable little dog and the concept of a dachshund talking about his grand adventures., Your domain name and blog title are your audience\u2019s first exposure to your \u201cbrand identity.\u201d In addition to letting readers know what to expect from your blog, your blog title and domain name will help place your blog in web searches, which is crucial for generating web traffic (and profit!).\n\n\nMake sure that your blog title fits with your overall blog \u201cidentity.\u201d For example, if you\u2019re running a dishy celebrity gossip blog, don\u2019t choose a stodgy or corporate-sounding title. On the other hand, if you\u2019re an authority on a business topic, you don\u2019t want your blog name to be too informal.Selecting a good keyword can be helpful. Search engines function through SEO (search engine optimization), which ranks search results based on how many keywords they have related to the person\u2019s search query. However, you don\u2019t want to get so wrapped up in SEO that your readers feel your blog is generic. Developing strong brand identity is the best thing you can do to draw readers to your blog.\nFor example, the hypothetical \u201chaircare.com\u201d tells readers what the blog is about, but it doesn\u2019t offer any \u201cangle\u201d on what kinds of hair care advice your blog offers. The hypothetical \u201cFrizzfighters.com\u201d is still clearly about hair care, but it gives off a fun vibe through its alliterative name and communicates your strong brand identity (funky, focused on a particular hair issue, hip).\nChoosing an extension is also important. The extension is the \u201c.com,\u201d \u201c.net,\u201d or \u201c.org\u201d after a website. There are now dozens of extensions, but those three are the most familiar to English-speaking audiences and will drive the most traffic to your website. Unless you\u2019re a non-profit or a similar type of blog, don\u2019t go for \u201c.org\u201d -- a \u201c.com\u201d is the top choice, followed by \u201c.net.\u201d\n\n, There are a number of popular blogging platforms around, including Blogger and Wordpress. Most experts recommend WordPress because it makes monetizing very easy.WordPress.org is a highly popular choice because you don\u2019t have to know any coding to design a slick blog. 1 in 5 websites use WordPress. Note: WordPress.org is a full-service blog hosting site, but you have to register your domain name and get set up with web hosting first. Wordpress.com has limited features and provides you a .wordpress domain name for free, but you can\u2019t put advertising or affiliate links on a wordpress.com blog.Blogger is run by Google, and is a free hosting site that requires just a Google account to start. Its designs are not as slick as those on WordPress.\nOther options include SquareSpace and Wix, which are website design platforms that will also allow you to create a blog.\nMake sure to investigate whether your platform supports custom domain names. The best blogging platforms will help you register your domain name and seamlessly integrate it with your blog.\nEach blog platform will walk you through creating a custom blog.\n\n, It\u2019s important that you create a design that reflects the content and image of your blog - from your font to your color choices, make sure each element of your blog's overall design is consistent with your blog's image.\n\n\nFor example, cartoony art and balloon fonts might be fun choices for a parenting blog, but would be seriously confusing on a professional marketing blog.\nConsider hiring a professional designer, at least for your header and logo. You only get one chance to make a first impression.Most blog hosts, including Blogger and WordPress, have \u201cthemes\u201d that you can install. These can sometimes be customized and give your blog a fun \u201cfeel.\u201d\n\n, Most blogs have common elements, such as \u201cAbout Me\u201d and \u201cArchives\u201d that allow readers to learn more about you and read past posts. Common features include:\n\n\nAbout Me\nCategories\nPosts\nPortfolio\nContact\n\n, Don\u2019t clutter your blog! Make it easy for readers to find the content they\u2019re looking for. Offer helpful elements such as a search bar and \u201cpopular posts\u201d sidebar.A \u201csplash header\u201d can be a good way to quickly orient new visitors. It is a large banner area at the top of the page that mentions the most important content and offers a quick introduction to the areas of the blog readers will be most interested in.Add a \u201cnext and previous posts\u201d feature. One way to build your readership is to keep your visitors hanging around! Adding \u201cnext\u201d and \u201cprevious\u201d buttons at the bottom of each post will drive your visitors to read more content.\n\n, Good blogs speak honestly and openly about a subject you're passionate about. Be yourself and share your ideas with the world!Be professional! Even if your blog is about your personal life, make it inviting for readers by making sure you don\u2019t have any proofreading errors or ugly designs.\nBe useful. Center your content on your reader, not yourself. This means that you consider what your audience can \u201cget out of\u201d each post. Look for a problem you can address, a question you can answer, or a story you can tell. Going on a five-page political rant may feel good, but it\u2019s unlikely to create a valuable experience for most readers.Be personal. Writing in overblown academese won\u2019t usually fly in blogs. Readers usually want to experience blogs as though they were having a conversation with the blogger. Develop your own sense of personal writing style and stick to it.\n\n, Break your posts up into scannable \u201cchunks\u201d to invite readers to stay and read.For example, you can use a list format, or break your post up into short separate paragraphs. If you have a really long post, try using subheaders and block quotes to break up the text.\nOther design elements, such bolding important points and using italics for emphasis, can draw readers to the most important stuff quickly.\nRemember that most readers are not willing to invest a lot of time reading something online. Keep your posts easy to skim and still get the basic idea.\n\n, You can have the best content in the world, but if your readers don\u2019t recognize it instantly, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll click through. Headlines are especially important because many readers will encounter your content through a feed reader, such as Google Reader, or content site like Digg. They may only see the headline at first, so it needs to communicate what your post will be about in an engaging, entertaining way.Create headlines that are useful but create a sense of urgency. You want your readers to feel like they need to discover this content.Play on readers\u2019 emotions. You can do this by asking a question or challenging expectations. Sites such as UpWorthy are excellent at this type of headline, such as this real headline: \u201cMost of These People do the Right Thing, But the Guys at the End? I Wish I Could Yell at Them.\u201d Headlines like these tell a story and promise a surprise., Don\u2019t announce your fabulous new blog only for readers to discover there are two lonely posts on it. Post 10-15 posts to start with, and queue another 10 or 15 to post on a regular basis.Consistency and quantity of content are crucial in developing a readership for your blog. If you don\u2019t have a lot of content up when readers visit, they aren\u2019t going to stick around or revisit.\nYou need to make sure that you post frequently. Prewriting posts and queuing them to post later is a good way to make sure that you have consistently updated content.\n\n, Many blog readers subscribe to blogs through RSS feeds, which provide them automatic updates when you make a new post. Post a clear link or icon on your blog to let visitors know how to subscribe., Once you have the basics down, you\u2019ll continue developing and learning more. It can take a long time for you to develop a big readership, so stay patient and keep posting., Register as a member using \"yourblogname.com\" as your username and post comments on related blogs This will drive traffic to your own blog.Build links to your blog by posting comments on other blogs that have \u201cdofollow\u201d links which means that search engines will see those links.\nDon\u2019t just hawk your blog in your comments! This can come across as selfish and spammy. Make your comments interesting and thoughtful. Remember, you\u2019re making your first impression in the comment!\n\n, If you\u2019re a great writer with something to say, a guest post on another popular blog can be a helpful way to get your name out there. Check out some popular blogs in your genre and see if they have a guest post option.If you don\u2019t see any information about guest posting, don\u2019t despair. Read through the blog to see if there have been other guest posts. If there are, contact the blogger and explain who you are and what you\u2019d like to write. If there aren\u2019t, you can still contact the blogger to see if it\u2019s something s\/he would be interested in.\n\n, Mentioning prominent figures in your area or genre can accomplish several things. It shows your readers you\u2019re \u201cin the know\u201d about the important people in your field. It may also encourage the prominent figure to look at your blog, or even promote it to her\/his own followers.Don\u2019t just name-drop. Make sure to incorporate these names in an organic, purposeful way. For example, if you were writing a post about mommy blogging, mention a blogger who has interested you, or whose blog you find amazing.\nLink, link, link! Link out blogs that you love in your own posts. Many bloggers track where their visits come from and may even visit (and link!) your blog in return., These days, if you\u2019re not on social media, you\u2019re missing out on major readership. Post a link to your latest article in your Twitter bio and ask for \u201cretweets,\u201d or link your content to your public Facebook page. Don\u2019t just replicate the same content over and over, though. Use social media for quick, attention-grabbing posts and your blog for longer, more engaging content. The following are popular social media sites:Twitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nStumbleUpon\nDigg\nReddit\nPinterest\n\n, Giveaways are a great way to drive traffic to your blog. Readers love getting something for free! Giving away products from companies offers the free advertising, so contact some companies that are relevant to your blog and see whether they\u2019d be interested in sponsoring a giveaway.You can also write to another blogger who sponsors great giveaways and ask for a contact or two.\nMake it easy to enter the giveaway. Asking readers to leave a comment on a post with their name and contact information or asking them to republish a link on social media are good ways to drive entries.\n\n, The newsletter may seem old-fashioned, but it\u2019s actually a powerful marketing tool.There\u2019s nothing like the power of directly connecting with people. Below are some other methods to consider:Add a link to your email signature inviting people to check out your latest post.\nSend your blog post to people who might be interested in reading it. Don\u2019t just spam your contacts here. Sending a link to your post to people (or other blogs) who might have a real interest in your content can get you new followers, especially if you offer to reciprocate by reading or reblogging their content.\nParticipate in blog carnivals. Search online for them or check out BlogCarnival.com.\nJoin a LinkedIn group. Particularly if you\u2019re writing a more \u201cprofessional\u201d or industry-based blog, posting a blog in a targeted Linkedin group can gain you valuable exposure.\n\n, SEO (search engine optimization) is very important, but it\u2019s more than just repeating a bunch of keywords. Include a search-engine-friendly headline, such as \u201cHow to\u201d or \u201cWays to.\u201d Repeat significant keywords in your post, but make sure you don\u2019t sound overly spammy.Google and most other search engines no longer operate strictly on SEO. They want to prioritize quality content, which means that providing clear, well-written, valuable content that links to other credible sources is your best bet.\n\n, Creating a video for marketing is much easier than you think. The best software used for making a video is Animoto.\n\n, Placing ads can be an excellent source of revenue for your blog. With \u201cpay per click\u201d (PPC) ads, you get paid when visitors to your blog click on ads that lead to other clients. You usually need to already have a strong readership and high visitor counts for ad buyers to be interested in your blog. Here are some examples of websites that pay you to place ads:Google\u2019s AdSense program is the most widely used PPC program because it has the power of Google Search behind it. Google will read your article and find \"ads that are relevant\" to it and display them next to or within the article. It will also use your readers\u2019 cookies to display ads that are relevant to their recently visited websites on your blog.You can also sign up for \u201ccost per impressions\u201d (CPM) ads. These function similarly to PPC, but they pay you based on units of \u201cimpressions\u201d (views) the ad gets, even if the visitor doesn\u2019t click on the link. Usually, the units are sets of 1,000 impressions.If you don\u2019t have about 10,000 unique visitors to your site every month, you aren\u2019t likely to make much money from ads. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to build up your readership through marketing and quality content., Affiliate marketing is a very popular way of monetizing a blog because it capitalizes on your readers\u2019 trust of you. If your posts always deliver quality content, then your audience is more likely to trust product or service recommendations. You can provide links or recommendations to relevant products and get a commission from any sales driven by your blog.Amazon Associates lets you place a banner on your website with products targeted at your audience, such as diapers for a parenting website or art supplies for a creative website. You earn a small commission when people buy something through your link. Amazon pays a commission ranging from 4% to 15%.\nAmazon is the giant in the industry, but it\u2019s also a good idea to reach out to small companies and even individuals who make products or services that are related to your blog. For example, if you have a popular cooking blog, you might contact small BBQ sauce companies to see if they\u2019d be interested in setting up an affiliate marketing program with you. You earn a portion of the sale through your blog, and they get free marketing.You can also check out other affiliate programs at big \u201cclearinghouse\u201d sites such as Commission Junction, LinkShare, and ShareASale. These sites offer huge lists of programs, from which you can choose the ones relevant to your blog.An affiliate aggregator service, such as VigLink, will automatically insert monetized affiliate links into posts for you. They keep a higher percentage of the commission than other services, but the convenience may make up for it., If you already have a high visitor count, you may be able to get other companies to pay you to \u201csponsor\u201d a post. The advertiser may contact you directly, or you can check out online \u201csponsorship marketplaces\u201d such as \"themidgame\".Be careful about sponsors who want you to place an article to increase their own page rank. This violates Google\u2019s policy and could hurt your AdSense revenue.You can also check out websites such as Blogsvertise, Social Spark, and Review Me for listings of paid or sponsored posts.Don\u2019t allow sponsored posts to overtake your own content. Remember: your readers visit your blog to read your content.\nMake sure that you only post sponsored posts that still benefit your readers in some way. You don\u2019t want your blog to seem like a corporate shill.\n\n, Working directly with a company to help with a promotional campaign can be a good way to boost traffic and revenue for your blog. Many companies, particularly ones like publishers, are happy to pay you to participate in things like Twitter parties, blog-based \u201cbook tours,\u201d and giveaways.For example, if you run a popular blog where you review romance novels, contact various romance publishers to see if they\u2019re interested in paying you for a review or other promotional event, like an author interview.\nSigning up with third-party connecting agencies can be helpful. Blog Friendly PR, Blog Insiders, and Brandfluential are popular networks., This type of revenue comes from providing sales \u201cleads\u201d to other companies who partner with your blog. You don\u2019t actually have to sell a product or service to generate these leads -- you just need your blog visitors to provide their information and opt in to being contacted by your partner.For example, if you run a popular DIY blog, you could partner with a home supply store. If your visitors agree to be contacted by the home supply store, you could get paid by the company for generating that \u201clead.\u201d\n\n, You may be able to use your blog to create freelance income by using it to showcase your work. Don\u2019t use your blog only to sell products, but having a \u201cportfolio\u201d section on your blog can let readers see what you\u2019re good at.For example, if you run a photography blog, keep a portfolio of your very best photographs and market yourself as a freelance photographer. Readers will know exactly what they\u2019re getting because they can see your passion and expertise.\nBlogs can also be very helpful even if you have a full-time \u201cday job,\u201d such as an attorney. For example, writing blog posts that offer helpful law advice and information will demonstrate to readers that you know your field. It will also give a sense of who you are personally, which is very important to prospective clients.\n\n, Once you have a loyal following and have demonstrated your trustworthiness, you can consider adding \u201cpaid content\u201d to your blog. For example, you could host a special podcast or write an e-book and charge visitors a small fee to access it.Paid courses, consulting services, and advice are other popular types of products and services you can use the reputation you\u2019ve established to sell.You can also use a service such as Zazzle or CafePress to create branded items like t-shirts and tote bags for sale.The Bloggess creates new items weekly, usually playing on a humorous post from the week before.\nConsider memberships, where you charge a small monthly fee for users to gain access to exclusive content, video content, or possibly direct access to you through Q&A or live events. WordPress has many plugins to help you add membership services to your blog.\nConsider \u201cbonus content.\u201d For example, if you run a podcast on your blog, you might consider having the standard episode available for free but a longer version or additional content for a small fee. Dan Savage\u2019s extremely popular \u201cSavage Lovecast\u201d runs on this model, where standard episodes are free and \u201cmagnum episodes\u201d (longer, with no ads) are available for a subscription fee.Many bloggers parlay their blog\u2019s success into books. The \u201cCake Wrecks\u201d blog has several popular books of disastrous cake photos,and The Bloggess now has two books about her life adventures.The \u201cTom + Lorenzo\u201d bloggers wrote a tongue-in-cheek \u201chow to guide\u201d to becoming a celebrity.Remember: anything you can offer that\u2019s valuable to your readers might be worth them paying for. Just don\u2019t let your blog become so paid-content-heavy that it doesn\u2019t seem like a good value to your audience anymore.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":896}

{"text":" A primary color is a bright color that is useful for mixing other bright colors but cannot itself be made by mixing other colors. Yellow is the perfect example. Try mixing yellow from orange and green, and the result is very \"dirty,\" not yellow at all. And yet we can use yellow with red to mix orange or with turquoise to mix green. This definition provides the rationale for the steps that follow.\n\n, For example, if you have a set of poster paints, arrange them like this: red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, cyan, blue, purple, magenta. Don't include any light, dark, or dull colors. No black, white, gray, brown, light pink, light blue, wine red, hunter green, navy blue, etc. Make sure your colors include all the candidates: yellow, orange, red, magenta, purple, blue, cyan, and green.\n\n, Now paint a sample of each color, arranging them around your circle in rainbow order as determined in step 1. Make sure they go all the way around so that your first and last colors wind up next to each other.\n\n, For example, try to make yellow by mixing orange and green. Try to make green by mixing yellow and turquoise. Continue around the entire circle, painting a sample of each mixture next to the color it's supposed to be.\n\n, The human eye has three types of color-sensing cone cells, which means that for those of us with normal color vision there are three primary colors. Yellow made from mixing orange and green is an obvious \"dirty\" result. The other primary colors may not be as obvious as yellow. In the photo above, which are the two other mixtures that look \"dirtiest\" in comparison to what they are trying to be? Those will be the other two primaries.\n\n, In the exercise above, you should have discovered that magenta, cyan, and yellow are the colors that cannot be mixed and therefore are primary. These are the colors used in photographic and computer printing. Here we will test this trio against the traditional red, yellow, and blue. If you are using artist colors, try transparent quinacridone magenta (PR122) and transparent phthalocyanine blue (PB 15:3 or 15) for magenta and cyan. If you are not using artist colors, that's fine too. Just look for colors that are a good match for the magenta and cyan inks used in printers. You can find color swatches on end flaps of many food boxes, and look for paints to match them.;\n, Compare your result to your red paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if red is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make red, then maybe magenta is the real primary color, not red. And, if magenta is a real primary color, it should work to make both reds and oranges when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and purples when mixed with transparent cyan. Try it!\n\n, Remember, if magenta is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your magenta paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that magenta is a primary color.\n\n, Compare your result to your blue paint, and see how well you can match it. Remember, if blue is a primary color, you should not be able to make it by mixing other colors. If you can make blue, then maybe cyan is the real primary color, not blue. And, if cyan is a real primary color, it should work to make lots of different greens when mixed with yellow, and to make blues and, yes, even purple, when mixed with magenta. Try it!\n\n, Remember, if cyan is primary, you should not be able to mix it from other colors. Compare your result to your transparent cyan paint, and see how well you can match it. Is your mixture dark and dirty looking? That would indicate that cyan is a primary color.\n\n, If red and blue can be mixed from other colors, and magenta and cyan cannot (or in any case your results are very \"dirty\"), the latter two must be the correct primary colors, not the former two, despite what we all were taught in third grade.\n\n, After following the above steps, it should be obvious that if magenta, not red, is the primary color, then it does not make sense to \"split\" our primary by calling magenta \"red with a blue bias\" and keeping red as our \"red with a yellow bias.\" Red as a primary color is simply an outdated and invalid idea, since red can be made by mixing magenta and yellow. If we cannot find an ideal magenta, a valid split primary would be two magenta's, one tending toward purple, the other toward red, PV19 and PR122 for example. Similarly, if cyan is the primary color, and not blue, then we should stop calling cyan \"blue with a green bias,\" since blue has nothing to do with it. True blue can be made from cyan and magenta, and is not a primary at all.\n\n, Just because red and blue can be mixed from other colors does not mean you need to throw them away. For example, you may be able to make a brighter orange with red than with magenta, since mixing paints closer to each other in hue gives generally brighter results. Plus, why go to the trouble to mix primaries when you have other colors that are ready to go?\n\n, Having correct primary colors is mainly important for when you need bright colors such as purple, pink, and turquoise. Often bright colors are not needed in fine art paintings, but are more necessary when making craft projects or for children's art projects. In either case, colors you can mix from cyan, magenta, and yellow are most likely going to be bright enough. Because primary colors allow you to paint with only three colors, plus white, they can save you money when it comes to buying paints. On the other hand, keeping red, blue, purple, orange, brown, and black paint around can mean less mixing, which saves you time (and possibly frustration).\n\n, This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. Try paints with pigments PB15, PB 15.3, etc. Steer clear of paints that include white pigments (PW).\n\n, This way you can discover which one is best for mixing the various colors. You can try paints with pigments PR122 and PV19, for example. Steer clear of paints that include white or blue pigments (PW, PB). This information can be found on the back of most artist colors.\n\n, The best cyan and magenta pigments is a hot topic these days. Using transparent colors will keep your mixtures from looking chalky or muddy.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":899}

{"text":" You will need to take this nationally standardized test for entrance into any graduate program--master's or doctorate. The current GRE has a verbal, math, and essay section. Most humanities departments, such as English and\/or Literature, will focus on the verbal and writing scores.Acquire a practice test and take some sample tests to help get a better score on the actual test.\nCheck your prospective program's guidebooks, usually on the department's website, for average accepted scores, as the scoring scheme on these tests changes from time to time.\nGRE scores are valid for 5 years after the year in which you took the test. The year runs from July 1-June 30.If your scores are more than 5 years old, you will likely need to retake the GRE.\nSubmit the scores on your tests to the correct school(s) you are applying to during the actual test. You can order up to four scores at the time that you take the test. If you are applying to more than four programs, you will need to order additional score reports for a fee.;\n, Not all doctoral programs require this subject test, but many do. Check the website or contact your prospective program's graduate coordinator to find out whether you need to take this test. If you do, you will almost certainly need to take it in addition to the GRE General Test.This subject test consists of about 230 questions that cover the full range of literature in English, including a few questions on important works of \"world lit\" that are routinely translated into English, such as Homer's Iliad or the Christian Bible.The test also covers basic knowledge about important cultural and historical contexts, as well as literary criticism.\nThe subject test is only offered on paper and is only offered at certain times of the year, which means that you need to schedule your exam well in advance. Additionally, you should allow up to six weeks for your scores to become available to your chosen graduate program(s)., The humanities can cover a wide variety of subjects. You do not have to have a master's degree in English to apply for an English Ph.D. program, but you should consider getting your earlier degrees in topics related to English\/Literature.Some Ph.D. programs will admit students directly from undergraduate programs, without requiring a master's degree first. You can investigate this option too.\n\n\nLook through your prospective master's program's degree offerings for an English and\/or Literature department.\nContact the graduate coordinator for the master's program you're considering to see if she recommends the program as a starting point for an academic career in English and\/or literary studies. If not, she may be able to direct you to better departments or programs.\nLook into related fields like history, anthropology, philosophy, and theology for potential leads on programs and classes that will benefit your breadth and depth of study.\nIf your master's degree is in a completely unrelated field, such as computer programming, don't despair. English is a very flexible field and welcomes people with all types of backgrounds. However, you will need to carefully and convincingly explain why you want to do a Ph.D. in English and how your experience has prepared you for the program.\n\n, If you're already in a master's program for English\/Literature, you might ask about staying at your current school for the doctorate degree. Some schools will allow students to combine some master's degree achievements into their doctorate program.If you have a \"fast track\" option you can and want to pursue, ask your advisor if you're in a position academically to move onto it by your program's deadline. Some will admit you only if you intend to pursue a doctorate.\nAcquire an accurate list of the requirements of the doctorate program in comparison to your existing master's program. This likely means increased credit hours, differences between a thesis and a dissertation (the final written composition you will produce), and changes to your course selection.\nEven if you do not have a \"fast track\" option, you may investigate the choice of staying in your current school for the Ph.D. after achieving your master's degree. However, this may require a fresh application, just as if you were a new student to the school.\n\n, Most humanities doctorate programs in the United States, English\/Literature included, require at least reading knowledge of at least one foreign language. If you are considering a prestigious graduate program, you may need to demonstrate competency in two or three languages.\n\n\nIf your thesis or dissertation involves incorporating multinational and older works, you may need additional languages beyond the program requirements.\nCheck your prospective program's course lists for what languages are regularly offered.\nGet a schedule of when the official knowledge reading exams or equivalent tests are given each semester.\nConsult with your prospective program about their requirements for passage of the language credit, especially if a class or just an exam is needed to pass the credit.\n\n, The thesis is the major writing composition at the end of a master's degree. These projects, at least for the master of arts in English\/Literature, are lengthy original works in poetry, fiction, drama, rhetoric and\/or similar genres.Choose something that will inform your dissertation later. Don't \"reinvent the wheel,\" as this will take you too long. Write about something that's already been done but look for new inspiration for your subject matter to write about or find a different angle within an established topic.\nKeep a portfolio of all your work. This will be helpful in applying for doctoral programs, teaching jobs, and\/or other forms of employment should you pursue them.\n\n, Look at your prospective schools' department lists to see if they have an English\/Literature department.You may want to take popular rankings systems, such as U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Grad Schools,\" into account.Take a close look at the faculty list of the top few programs you are most interested in and narrow down the list to professors that cover the sub-fields of English\/Literature you are interested in.Consider highly ranked schools first. Students who earn their doctorates from the top 10 programs are significantly more likely to find tenure-track positions after graduating.Apply to the most prestigious programs you think you have a shot at. It is also wise to have a \"fall-back school,\" which is well-ranked but more within reach.\n\n, This professor will most likely direct both your program of study and dissertation.\n\n\nIntroduce yourself and your ideas for the theoretical project you would like to work on with this faculty member.\nExplain about the work you've already done, including compositions from your master's program. This is a good chance to engage the faculty member on literary, rhetorical, and pedagogical (teaching) ideas and see if you can form a good professional relationship.\nThe professor you pair up with finally is frequently referred to as your \"major professor\" for various purposes. Sometimes they will also be called your dissertation director when that time comes.\nOn rare occasions, major professors will leave a department\/university for one reason or another. It is possible to still work with them remotely if you can get permission from your department\/program. Otherwise, you will have to find another professor in the department to take you on.\n\n, If you've narrowed your prospective program choices down to just a handful, then physically going to them may help make your decision about where to spend the next few years it may take to get your degree.Schedule time to meet with the professor(s) you may work with. See if you can at least with your potential major advisor to go over likely dissertation subjects, courses, and program expectations.\nTake a walk around the department. Find out what the other English, Literature, and Creative Writing professors and grad students are studying. They may contribute to your work and vice-versa.\nFind out if there are any writing clubs, literary workshops, poetry reading groups, book clubs or similar organizations that work with the department or university that could be of use to your topic. Get their contact information at the very least.Ask to talk with current doctoral students in the program. Many graduate programs will organize informal lunches, dinners, or social times with current grad students so that you can ask questions about what their experience is like. These can be just as informative as speaking with the faculty, if not more so. Ask about the camaraderie of the department, work\/life balance, and whether there are any \"problem\" faculty you should be aware of.\n\n, You will need these for your applications to other graduate schools. These letters will, ideally, highlight your aptitude and work ethic, among other positive traits observed by those that know your work and character.Try to give your chosen writers at least a month's advance notice so they can take their time writing the letter. Consider providing your writers with a copy of your curriculum vitae (C.V.) to help remind them of your work. Be transparent and let them know exactly what the letter is for and the school you intend to apply for. They can tailor the letter better for your needs.\nPick writers that know your work, such as teachers and employers. Make sure you seek letters that include some from your master's program faculty--especially your thesis advisor. Your program may have specific requirements about who writes the letters.\nChoose not to see the letters before they are sent. Sometimes you are given the option of viewing sealed or unsealed letters before they are sent to where you apply, and some schools will invalidate the letters if they are unsealed. Additionally, requesting to examine the letter may seem as though you do not trust the sender. If the faculty member seems hesitant to recommend you, it is better to find someone else than take a half-hearted letter.\nConfirm with the school if the letters need to be sent from the university, on university letterhead, submitted electronically, or should be sent with your application packet.\nIf there is a physical mailing involved, provide the properly addressed envelope and postage to your writers. If there is an electronic submission involved, make sure all the web addresses are correct, and get confirmations.\nIf it's approaching the deadline and your recommenders have not provided their letters, it's acceptable to give them a polite reminder about your request for a letter of recommendation.\n\n, Your personal statement, sometimes called a statement of purpose, is a major component of your application. It introduces you to the admissions committee and makes your case as to why you want to pursue a doctorate in English\/Literature. You should prepare to write several drafts of this important document and get feedback from mentors. The personal statement may be anywhere from 500 words to two pages.Discuss your academic background, research interests, and professional aspirations. If you have already conducted extensive research or have peer-reviewed publications, mention them here. Talk in detail about what you want to research and how the degree will further your career goals.Mention specific attractions about the program to which you\u2019re applying. For example, do they have an extensive rare manuscripts library? Is there a faculty member you are keen to work with? You don\u2019t need to \u201csuck up\u201d to the committee, but making informed statements about why you want to study at each particular program will help convince the committee that you have prepared for the work ahead.Avoid cliches. Do not talk about how you have always liked to read, or how you burn with a hard, gem-like flame for poetry. Do not use a dictionary definition or famous quote to open your essay. Convey that you are engaging with the field at a professional level.\nShow, don\u2019t tell. Use specific examples whenever possible. For example, don\u2019t say \u201cI am passionate about literature.\u201d Say \u201cIn my spare time I volunteer as a reading group coordinator for underprivileged schoolchildren because I want to share with them my passion for literature.\u201dTry to keep your writing polished but approachable. You don\u2019t want to come across as stuffy, but you also don\u2019t want to come across as unsuited for the rigors of a Ph.D. program.\n\n, You will need to submit a writing sample to your doctoral program. This sample displays your intellectual abilities, the quality and rigor of your work, and your promise as a scholar. Ask for help from a mentor or faculty member in choosing what essay you will use as your writing sample.You may be asked to prepare several writing samples, especially if you are applying to a doctoral program with a creative writing emphasis. Choose samples that reflect the variety of your work as well as the quality of it.\nKeep your sample to the length requested. If this means you have to cut chunks out of it, do so. Do not submit a sample significantly longer than requested. The committee may well simply stop reading it., You will likely need to submit your CV along with your other application materials. If you are applying to the Ph.D. directly from your undergraduate degree, you may need to include some accomplishments from your high school years. If you are applying from your master\u2019s program, make sure that you don\u2019t include too much early stuff -- this can make it appear as though you are padding your CV. However, unlike with a traditional resume, the lengthier your CV, the better, so do not leave off important information.Include the following sections:Heading. This includes your name, address, and contact information\nEducation. This includes your degrees, beginning with those in progress or most recently earned. Include the name of the institution, city\/state, degree type and major, and the month and year the degree was (or will be) awarded. If you graduated with honors, it is acceptable to mention it. If you are coming from a master\u2019s program, state your thesis title and advisor\u2019s name.\nRelevant Experience. List positions that reflect your experience and expertise. If you have prior teaching or tutoring experience, highlight this, as you will likely need to teach to support yourself in the doctoral program. Include your job title, organization name, city\/state, and the dates you held each position. Include a brief summary of your responsibilities. Don\u2019t include non-academic jobs here.\nPublications. If you have already published research or creative work, list it here. If you do not have publications, you can title this section \u201cResearch Experience\u201d and discuss any major research projects you have conducted or assisted with.\nProfessional Presentations. If you have attended conferences or other professional events, list them here.\nHonors and Awards. List any competitive scholarships or fellowships you have received. You may also list scholastic honors and other awards.\n\n, Some will be printed, some will be online. Make sure you have mailing supplies (large yellow envelopes, postage stamps) if it's a print application. Make sure you have the correct browser software and settings according to the instructions if it's online.\n\n\nThese can be large and detailed forms, so take your time. If it's a paper application, print a couple of copies in case you fill out something incorrectly and need to redo a page. Hold off stapling the pages until the end.\nFor online applications, make sure you set aside plenty of time since they often are done in one sitting. Save your work frequently if possible.\nUse a large yellow envelope to mail your application materials to the university in the case of a print application. If you are unsure of the amount of postage you need, take the entire pack to your local post office and they will weigh it, let you know the postage amount, and mail it for you if request.\nSubmit your application online if that is the method available.\n\n, Ask friends to proofread your application as well. Print out your documents and read them in hard-copy. You are applying to the highest-level degree in your field, and the admissions committee will notice minor errors. Sloppy proofreading suggests a lack of commitment., You should consider applying to at least half a dozen schools, if not more. These departments can vary considerably in size and funding, so it's hard to predict how much competition you will be facing.\n\n\nMost programs will have fees associated with applying, so take that into consideration with the number of applications you submit.\nBe prepared that you may get staggered responses from your different applications. Some may accept, wait-list, or reject you earlier than others.\nIf you are accepted or wait-listed fairly early, be alert to response deadlines since most programs are aware that students they accepted sometimes refuse admission. This may open up a position for a wait-listed student, but also may compel you to make a decision on one school that accepted you before others have responded.\n\n, Make sure they arrived at your prospective doctoral program by its application deadline.\n\n\nSome schools will have this service for free, some will have you pay for it. But to be official, they must be submitted by your school to the destination. Some schools will ask for copies from you in the interim, but those will be unofficial.\n\n, The names of the major field may differ from school to school, but some examples of major concentrations include: medieval, Renaissance, Restoration and 18th century (British\/American), 19th century (British\/American), criticism, theory, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, and rhetoric.Most universities require a major field to be taken along with several minor fields to improve a graduate's breadth of academic coverage. So you may focus on one area, but still take a few classes in others you weren't initially interested in.\n\n, These will be professors that lead your minor fields and consult for your comprehensive exams in addition to your major advisor. They may or may not continue onto your dissertation committee.\n\n\nTake classes with at least some of your committee members if possible. It will help them learn your work, and facilitate collegiality (professional friendship).\nSome universities require an \"out of area\" member--a professor from another department to ensure your department is not giving students a free pass. Ask your major professor who they recommend, or if you have a professor in mind, run the choice by your advisor first.\nOccasionally committee members will retire, move, or for whatever reason leave the department. If this happens you can arrange with your department to conduct academic business with them remotely, or consult the procedures to replace them.\n\n, These professionals are the source of information and guidance throughout your program.\n\n\nCheck with your department's academic advisor especially for administrative information and deadlines. Also the advisor can help make sure you're on time with fulfilling the required credits for your major and minor fields.\nMeet with your major professor frequently for guidance on theoretical ideas, professional development, and to make sure you are meeting program requirements in conjunction with the academic advisor.\nCheck your program rules for how many credits you need for each major and minor concentration. You might want to keep your own chart in addition to the department's records.\nSee if some classes \"double count\" for major and minor fields, two minor fields, etc., with your advisor. This can free up room to take other classes you need or might be interested in.\nDo not be averse to taking classes out of your \"comfort zone.\" This can lead to helpful collaborations with other colleagues, introduce rich ideas into your work, and provide breadth and depth to your professional applications later.\n\n, In most doctorate of English\/Literature programs, a minimum of 2 years or 30 credit hours of full-time coursework is required for the degree beyond the master's degree. But this can vary widely.Pick mostly classes that also help your dissertation along with the writing that you will complete for them.\n\n, Most graduate programs fund their students through assistantships of some kind. Frequently, teaching assistants provide grading or some other form of assistance to professors and the department on a part-time basis during the semester.\n\n\nTake advantage of opportunities to instruct a class if you get them. This will be practice for a teaching position should you get one, and experience you can put on a job application later. Note that even if you are the instructor of record, meaning you are entirely in charge of teaching the class, you will likely still be called a \u201cTeaching Assistant.\u201d\n\n, Most programs require students to pass a written and\/or oral comprehensive exam to become a Ph.D. candidate, at which point all coursework is recognized as complete and only the dissertation remains for degree completion.\n\n\nPrepare for this test to cover the major and minor concentration fields. In some programs, you may get to choose which areas you take exams in. Other programs may have pre-established examination areas.\nGet questions or prepare with your committee members ahead of time.\nExpect the written essay parts to last several hours, whether in take-home form or on-site in a classroom\/computer lab form. If you know graduate students that have taken exams from these professors before, you should consider asking them what to expect--but remember your experience could still be different, their experience should just be a guide.\nOral exams typically involve the entire committee in the room together with you, asking you questions. This can be very intimidating, but typically you will not be allowed to enter comprehensive exams unless your major professor thinks you are ready. If at any point you are having serious questions, consult your major professor first.\n\n, You should do this to plan your dissertation's development. Your status at this point frequently will be called \"ABD\" (all but dissertation).\n\n\nDiscuss fellowship and grant funding opportunities for your dissertation work.\nEstablish your dissertation committee, keeping in mind it may differ from your committee leading up to comprehensive exams. You should pick committee members that contribute to your work's theoretical framework, but also can help with the practical writing critique.\nGet an idea of time-frame for completion. This will likely change, but you should keep in mind your program's deadline to complete your degree requirements. Otherwise, you may need to retake your comprehensive exams or file an extension (to allow more time to complete the degree) with your university.\nDiscuss other professional activities you might do while \"ABD,\" including book reviews, conferences, teaching assistance, etc.\n\n, Consult frequently with your major advisor about your work. Ideally, you can build off of ideas you generated earlier in your master's program and\/or classes, but either way you will be doing a considerable amount of additional writing.Outline your rhetorical ideas, characterizations, plots, inspirations, philosophical arguments, methods, and keep a list of works you may cite.\nPlan a more detailed time frame for completing each step of your dissertation including time to travel if needed to gather resources, when you might complete chapters, and potential defense dates.\nExplain how your work fits in genre of literature you seek to enter.\n\n, Outline the dissertation itself including chapters, subheadings, and a works cited section. This will organize your thoughts, and keep your workload manageable.\n\n\nConsider dropping in headings of works you have already done as potential chapter titles\nHaving sections to work on will allow you to more easily budget your time to work on the dissertation. You can work on a section, take a break, move onto another, and repeat.\nEnsure an overall theme or current of thought is running through these sections you are setting up. If you set this up in your outline, it will focus your ability to maintain coherent thoughts in the body of the dissertation.\n\n, There are numerous funding opportunities for humanities and graduate students. Consult with your program's and college's listings as well as any academic societies you may belong to. These can be competitive, so look for and apply to multiple sources.Find funding for the right stage of your work \"pre-dissertation,\" while you're researching, and others while you're in the writing phase near completion.Ensure that your project falls within the grant\/fellowship scope, and write any application letters to argue for such a case.\nMake a note of deadlines and notification time frames as they tend to move from semester to semester and year to year.\nCheck to see if you can satisfy the grant\/fellowship commitments beyond your own work. Some will ask you to conduct lectures, present your progress, travel, etc...\n\n, Like the thesis, this will be mostly original work. Bring in the work you used for your master's degree if applicable. Look for contributions that will enrich your content.\n\n\nAsk experienced writers for help on other techniques, plot devices, and\/or writing strategies that might help your work along.\nPresent work you do at conferences to get early feedback before it\u2019s in the final form. You may also get ideas on more concepts you had not considered.\n\n, Keeping a steady writing schedule can be extremely difficult, especially as one is likely to have other distractions from life crop up by the time the dissertation writing phase arrives.\n\n\nTry to write just a little each day, maybe a couple of hours. If you can't, then maybe set aside blocks of time you know you won't be disturbed on specific days.\nShop around parts of what you write to your major advisor or graduate students at the same level of progress as yourself. Putting together a group of students at the dissertation phase can be mutually motivating.\n\n, Upon completion of the dissertation, each student meets with a dissertation committee--usually the major advisor, a few others from your department, and one \"out of area\" faculty member. If the committee approves the dissertation and defense, you will have completed the degree.\n\n\nMake sure you have consulted with your committee on a date and gotten a location for the defense. Frequently these defenses are budgeted to last two hours, but may be shorter.\nIf one professor is abroad, see if teleconferencing them in is an option.\nCheck with your college office\/advisor to see if your dissertation has met all formatting requirements.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":901}

Apartments and villas in developments are generally the best option for this, as the grounds will be cared for and the presence of neighbors will help to keep your property safe. Buying in popular tourist areas will also make your property easier to rent if you want to earn income when you are not using it.\nPermanent home \u2013 You will want to look for a home and region that fits your budget and offers the quality of life you desire in terms of local infrastructure, facilities, and accessibility. So while you may long for a country home, it may not be reasonable if you also want to be near stores and other expats. You will also need to consider the local schools if you have children, and access (TGV and airports) if you wish to travel or entertain guests.;\n, Alongside price of the property, fees and taxes, there are annual taxes you will have to pay whether you move to Spain, rent your property, or use it as a vacation home.\n\n\nIBI (Impuesto Sobre Bienes Inmuebles) is a property ownership tax set locally that ranges from 0.4% to 1.1% of the valor catastral \u2013 the administrative value of the property, often lower than the market value. Owners might pay as little as 100 euros per year for a small country property, but a luxury home in an expensive development on the waterfront in Marbella might cost as much as 3,000 euros per year.Wealth Tax \u2013 Over a certain amount, the net worldwide assets of residents and the Spanish assets of non-residents are taxed. There is a 700,000 euro deduction per person (500,000 in Catalonia) and a 300,000 euro deduction for the property of residents. Tax is then calculated on assets above and beyond these deductions, with the rate ranging from .2% to 2.5%. For the rate table, see here.\nPersonal Income Tax \u2013 Non-residents pay this tax based on the property they own in Spain. Those who don\u2019t rent out their property and have no other Spanish income pay 25% of 2% of the valor catastral of the property. A property worth 500,000 euros, for instance, would pay 25% of 10,000 euros, or 2,500 euros. Non-residents who rent out their property must pay taxes on the income generated, generally 25% of the gross income earned in Spain., If you are a national from another EEC (European Economic Community) country, then you already have the right to move to and work in Spain. However, you will need to acquire a residency card if you are retiring to Spain, moving to Spain and not working, or are a non-EU dependant of an EU national.If you are from outside the EU, you will need to apply for a residence visa in order to immigrate to Spain, and a work permit if you want to work there. The most common types of visa are:Resident Visa to Retire in Spain \u2013 This visa allows you to live in Spain without working. You will need a valid current passport, proof of adequate financial resources to live in Spain without working, a medical certificate from your doctor verifying that you do not suffer from contagious diseases, drug addiction, or mental illness, and a fee of $38 to $160, depending on your nationality.Resident Visa to Work in Spain \u2013 To get a working visa, you will first need to be hired by a Spanish company. They will contact the Spanish Immigration Office to request a letter approving your work permit and residency visa. When applying for your visa, you will need this letter, a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate from the country you currently live in, a medical certificate, and a fee of $38 to $190, depending on your nationality.Residence Visa for Investors or Self-Employed \u2013 You can acquire this visa if your source of income will not involve being hired in Spain. In addition to the application forms, you will need a valid passport, a Police Records Certificate, a Medical Certificate, evidence of proper degree or academic title if necessary for your work, evidence that you are financially sound, and a work or investment project document showing the type of business you will conduct, projected gains, and positions to be created (if applicable), as well as a list of the authorizations and permits required to conduct your business., Buying a home in Spain is a major, and life-changing, experience. Think carefully before making any decision and ensure that your family is behind you.\n\n\nOnce you know which area and property you\u2019re interested in buying, be certain you have enough funds for the purchase. Don\u2019t forget to consider such aspects as the cost of moving your possessions to Spain.\nDon\u2019t be rushed into making a decision, and don\u2019t let yourself be pressured. Certainly don\u2019t sign anything until you\u2019re ready.\nPensioners should make certain that they can have their pensions paid into a Spanish bank. It\u2019s most important that your have health insurance in place and that you make a will. Resident non-citizens may also purchase Spanish health insurance (cost depends on income) by visiting a social security office in Spain.\nSometimes circumstances change, and you might find you want to return to your home country. Before committing yourself to purchasing a home in Spain, make sure you have sufficient funds to make the move back home.\n\n, The region that is right for you is a subjective decision. You may be looking for the sun, sand, and expat community of the southeast coast, or prefer a quiet rural area. Be sure to research the regions carefully, and then visit the areas you think sound promising before you start searching for property in earnest.\n\n, The regions of Catalona, Valencia, and Murcia contain a long stretch of coast that has been called Spain\u2019s California because of its mild climate and beautiful beaches.\n\n\nCatalonia \u2013 Prices Medium to High \u2013 This region includes Barcelona and the Costa Brava \u2013 the coast north of the city where the Pyrenees run down to the sea \u2013 and the Costa Dorada, the flatter coast south of Barcelona. The area is well-developed and efficiently run, with beautiful beaches and an attractive countryside of farms, orchards, and vineyards. The winters are mild.Valencia \u2013 Prices Low (south coast) to Hight (north coast) \u2013 The Mediterranean coast south of Catalonia features a mild year-round climate, beautiful beaches, and a large expat community, particularly along the Costa Blanca, which runs from Denia to Pilar de la Horadada, south of Alicante. Its popularity with expats from across Northern Europe makes the Costa Blanca a cosmopolitan and varied place to live. However it also means higher taxes on new properties.Murcia \u2013 Prices Low \u2013 This area includes the Costa Calida, which lies south of the Costa Blanca. The climate is very dry, and the region is not highly developed. However, both the cost of purchasing property and the cost of living are very low, making this an attractive retirement location., Andalusia is extremely varied, with three stretches of coast that each have markedly different characters, and a variety of famous cities such as Seville, Cadiz, and Granada.\n\n\nAndalusia \u2013 Prices Medium to High \u2013 Andalusia is home to the Costa de la Luz, Costa de Almeria, and the Costa del Sol. This last stretch of coast is hugely popular among British expats due to its warm climate. The Costa de la Luz is both cooler and much less developed., The pricey Balearics off the coast of Spain and the more low-key Canaries off of Morocco's southern coast are perhaps more different than they are alike, though these island destinations share the distinction of being popular vacation and retirement destinations for Spaniards and foreigners alike.\n\n\nBalearics \u2013 Price High \u2013 Though expensive, these islands feature temperate, but seasonal weather, beautiful scenery, and high-quality housing stock. The largest, Mallorca, features great marinas, an opera house, and an international crowd. Menorca has a drier climate, with a cooling breeze that takes the edge off the baking heat of the summer. Ibiza has a reputation as a party destination for tourists, which means it is a good place to buy a property to rent out. Formentera is the smallest island with a mixture of attractive new developments and mellow old farmhouses.\nCanaries \u2013 Price Medium \u2013 Though a bit isolated and far distant from the rest of Spain, the Canary islands have the warmest summer climate in Spain, a varied topography including mountains and sandy beaches, a large international community, and lower taxes when purchasing property., The northern interior of Spain tends to be hotter and drier, while the northwest coast is cooler and wilder. As a result, both offer good value, particularly Galicia.\n\n\nGalicia \u2013 Price Low \u2013 Though the weather is cooler and the winters less mild than the more famous southeast, the northwest Atlantic coast has grown more popular recently due to lower costs, fewer expats, and a more rural feel., Homes in Barcelona retained their value better than the coasts in the recent downturn, while the property markets in Madrid and Valencia have recently begun to recover, making them good sites for investment.A variety of other cities like Segovia, Granada, Cordoba, Ovieda, Sevilla, and Vigo offer beautiful architecture and a high quality of life.Four cities, however, stand out as popular places to buy:\n\n\nBarcelona \u2013 Price High \u2013 The Telegraph recently listed Barcelona as one of the top 20 places in the world to invest in propertyThe second largest city in Spain and its cultural capital, it boasts a beautiful old town, a mild Mediterranean climate, and access to nearby beaches.Madrid \u2013 Price High \u2013 The capital of Spain and the third largest city in Europe, Madrid is rich with history and things to do, though it does get rather hot during the summer.\nValencia \u2013 Price Medium \u2013 Known as the \u201cCalifornia of Europe,\u201d Valencia has mild temperatures, great cuisine, a rich history and beautiful architecture. It also offers easy access to beautiful beaches.Malaga \u2013 Price Low \u2013 At the heart of the Costa del Sol, Malaga offers a charming old town center, low prices,and has recently been rated the best Spanish city to live in., The best way to narrow down where you might want to live is by researching various areas exhaustively. Use the internet, magazines and books related to purchasing homes in Spain.Be sure to research:\n\n\nThe property market in the area. If you are buying as an investment, you will want to avoid areas with declining values.\nThe nature of daily life in the area.\nThe downsides and risks in that area. Is it isolated? Are taxes relatively high compared to other areas? Is it developed enough for your tastes?\nLawyers and agents who you might work with during your purchase.\n\n, The ideal way to do this is to rent for a few months in the area you are considering. If that is not possible, even a week dedicated to exploring the region and talking to ex-pats about their experience can be hugely helpful. Be sure to treat this as a fact-finding mission, not a vacation. Your goal is to get a feel for daily life and to meet the people who you will work with in buying property., Get your finances in order and investigate a mortgage. You will need to do this in advance so that you can move quickly when you find the property you want. There are three options: remortgaging your current home (i.e. taking a home equity loan), borrowing from a bank in your current country, or arranging a mortgage on your Spanish property through a Spanish lender. Bear in mind that an overseas mortgage may incur higher set-up costs (sometimes 3 to 4 per cent of the amount borrowed) and that Spanish lenders will not be interested in doing business if existing loans exceed 35 per cent of the borrower\u2019s income, as is the case in much of Western Europe.\n\n\nRemortgaging \u2013 This is typically the cheapest and easiest solution. Releasing equity in your current home means that the second home can be purchased for cash, without the need for another mortgage. However, this is only feasible for those who own their first home outright. Also, you may lose your home if you cannot make your payments.Loan in your country \u2013 Most banks that lend for purchasing in Spain will have offices there, meaning you are technically borrowing in Spain. However, it can be easier to work with a local bank. You will also need to consider the type of currency you take the loan in. If you will be living off of income in your home country, then it is a good idea to take the loan in that currency to avoid exchange-rate fluctuations that might increase your repayments. If you will be generating income in Spain \u2013 buy renting your property, for instance \u2013 then consider taking out the loan in euros.Loan in Spain \u2013 Taking out a mortgage in Spain can simplify repayments, save you on the bank commissions charge for international transactions, and allow you to take advantage of low interest rates.However, a Spanish mortgage will increase initial costs, since the stamp tax you pay upon purchasing a new home will be based not on the loan amount, but on the value of the mortgage including interests and costs. This will increase the stamp tax from .5% to 1% to somewhere between 1.5% and 2%., When evaluating properties, you should budget 15% on top of the agreed purchase price to cover the various fees and taxes that must be paid.Legal fees \u2013 Many lawyers charge 1% of purchase price or more. It is generally more cost-effective to hire a lawyer by the hour. A typical transaction should cost 1,000 to 2,500 euros.IVA (Spain\u2019s equivalent of VAT) \u2013 This tax is 10% for residential properties that have never before been occupied, plus 1% stamp duty. The stamp duty is 1.5% in Valencia and 2% in Murcia.In the Canaries, the IVA is 4.5%ITP (Impuesto sovre Transmisiones Patrimoniales) \u2013 This transfer tax is due on re-sale property. It is generally 7%, but may be as high as 10%, depending on the region where you are buying and the price. For the ITP for various regions, see here.\nNotary and property registration fees \u2013 These range from .5% to 1%.Land registry costs - The cost to register is usually around 1%.\n\n, There are a variety of different types of home available in Spain, from small apartments to large villas. What you are looking for will depend on your budget and how you intend to use the property.Villa (vivienda unifamiliar) \u2013 These are relatively large detached properties with a home and grounds. They are great permanent homes, but function less well as vacation homes, since the grounds entail a good deal of maintenance year-round and their value results in higher taxes.\nApartment (apartamento) \u2013 Apartments are the most widely available type of property in Spain. They are ideal vacation properties, as they are easier and cheaper to manage. It is also easier to find apartments close to town centers.\nModern semidetached (casa adosada) \u2013 These properties are most often built as parts of large new developments, and typically feature two stories and a small private garden. They are good both as permanent homes and vacation homes, offering the privacy and space of a villa with the relatively low upkeep of an apartment. They are still rare outside of highly developed areas.\nVillage house (casa de pueblo) \u2013 These village homes are typically semi-detached townhouses. They offer a lower price, village ambiance and shops and stores in walking distance. However, they usually also need a good deal of work, particularly on the kitchen and bathrooms. For those looking for vacation homes, they are also less than ideal as it can be difficult to find property management companies in smaller villages.\nCountry house or farm house (cortijo \/ masia \/ casas rural \/ finca) \u2013 These properties are less expensive than coastal properties. They offer good value and idyllic surroundings. However, particularly for those who are not fluent in Spanish, they can also be isolating. They are not ideal as vacation homes or rental properties, as upkeep and management at a distance is challenging.\n\n, There are different rules and taxes in Spain depending on whether you are buying off-plan property, new construction, or resale property.\n\n\nResale property \u2013 These properties are generally safer investments, as you don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not they will be completed. Taxes upon purchase are also generally lower. However, you should be prepared to spend money on repairs and updates, particularly in the kitchen and bathrooms.New construction (obra nueva) \u2013 This is the most expensive type of property, although recently rampant construction in Spain has led to a market with too many homes and not enough buyers, bringing down the price. The biggest advantages are that unlike with off-plan properties, you know exactly what you are getting, and unlike with resale properties, you won\u2019t have to do any remodeling.Off-plan (sobre plano) property \u2013 This is property for which the plans have been finalized and approved by local authorities, but for which construction has not yet finished. The benefit is that compared to completed new properties, you should get a discount of 10% to 20% off the current market price. On the other hand, you will have to rely on plans and your imagination; you won\u2019t see the actual property you have purchased until it is finished. And, you will have to wait a year and a half or more to move in, if everything runs smoothly. It is imperative that you choose an established, reliable developer to ensure timely, quality construction, and that you do a thorough inspection to locate construction problems before completing the sale., Many who buy their property as a vacation home plan to rent it out for short blocks of time (three months or less) to vacationers in order to make income when they are not there. However, this is not always legal in Spain. In many areas, there are limits on renting property short-term, as well as on marketing private property to tourists. If you fail to comply with local rules, fines can be as high as 30,000 euros.Before you buy, seek independent legal advice, speak with a property management company, or check the rules for short-term rental at your local town hall to make sure it is permitted.\n\n, Agents can not only find you the right property, but also guide you through the legal process of purchasing it. Remember, though: estate agents in Spain are paid by the seller, so they do not always have the buyer\u2019s interest in heart. The best way to select an agent is through the recommendations of friends and acquaintances, followed by an interview to ensure you are comfortable working together. There are several types of broker you can choose between:Corredores \u2013 These are local brokers in rural Spain who know when people want to sell and who charge very small commissions \u2013 about 1% to the buyer and seller each. Few speak Spanish or have offices, but if you are fluent, it is worth spending time in an area to seek out the local corredor.\nBuyer\u2019s Agents \u2013 These agents are paid an upfront fee to search for properties on behalf of clients, but unlike search and find companies, they receive no commission from estate agents, meaning they are free to show properties from private sellers. They will visit and inspect potential properties, as well as walk client\u2019s through the purchase process. They usually charge a successful search fee of about 2.5% of the sale price.\nForeign-Based Agents offering Spanish Property \u2013 Look for offices that have opened their own branch in Spain. They will know much more about the local market than those who simply pass clients on to agents in Spain in return for part of the commission.\nForeign-Owned Estate Agents \u2013 Because there are no qualifications to become an estate agent in Spain, the numbers of agents catering to foreigners \u2013 the English in particular \u2013 has exploded in recent years. There are of course good agents, but be forewarned that in many areas, they charge excessive commissions (7.5% and up) and use pressure-sales techniques.\n\n, There are several types of broker that you should avoid, as they add negligible value while inflating the commission you must pay.Online Property Companies \u2013 Most of these companies do not have offices in Spain or their own listings. Instead, they are marketing companies that list agent\u2019s properties in return for a cut of the commission. As a result, they often charge inflated fees. Also, many listing are out of date. Other attractive properties are not actually for sale; they are listed only so the agent can acquire interested parties\u2019 contact info.\nIntroducers \u2013 These are people \u2013 generally expats \u2013 who befriend local visitors and offer to introduce them to trustworthy estate agents, in return for part of the agent\u2019s commission. Be warned: they are most likely to introduce you to aggressive agents seeking high commissions.\nSearch and Find Companies \u2013 These companies do not list their own properties. Instead, they will search for properties that meet a client\u2019s specifications, drawing up lists of properties to be examined. They work by splitting the commission with local real estate agents, which often leads to inflated fees.\nMulti-Listing Networks \u2013 Foreign agents and Spanish agents alike often participate in networks whereby they can show clients one another\u2019s listings. When shown a listing, always clarify if it is from another agent, and if so, whether the commission will be split or simply increased, as is often the case.\n\n, It is best to hire a lawyer before you set out to inspect possible purchases. Otherwise, you may find yourself pressed for time and be unable to properly interview and research the lawyer you choose.You will want a lawyer who is fluent in English and Spanish, and who specializes in Spanish land law (urbanismo). They can help guide you through the purchase process and inform you of the tax implications.If choosing a lawyer in your home country, be sure that they have experience working in Spain.\nIf you choose a lawyer based in Spain, as for their registration number, which you can use to see if they are registered with the local bar association (Colegio de Abogados).\n\n, You will want to visit the property to ensure that you like both the home and the area where it is located. If it is an existing structure, consider hiring a property inspector to walk through the building with you. Take careful note of any repairs or remodeling you will need to do. If you are purchasing off-plan, be sure to carefully consider the plans and completion schedule and to talk with both the developer and locals to ensure that you are working with a reliable company.\n\n, To buy in Spain, you will need insurance, a fiscal number, euros, and a Spanish bank account. It is best to set these things up in advance in order to save money.\n\n\nFiscal number (numero de identificacion de extranjeros) \u2013 This is your identification number for tax purposes in Spain. It can be obtained by you or an agent in Spain and takes 2 to 6 weeks to acquire.Foreign Exchange Account \u2013 If your funds are in a currency other than euros, you will need to purchase euros. Using a currency broker is by far the cheapest way to do so, and may save you thousands. Contact one ahead of time to ensure you get the best rate on your transaction.Insurance \u2013 If you use a Spanish mortgage, the lender will help to arrange insurance. Otherwise, you will need to purchase your own insurance through a Spanish company.\nBank account \u2013 Most sellers will only accept checks drawn on Spanish banks, so you will need a local account. If you have taken out a Spanish mortgage, it is easiest to open an account at the bank that lent you the money. Otherwise, be careful to discuss transaction fees for international transfers before opening an account., If you are not fluent in Spanish, you should be sure that you have all contracts and legal documents translated into English by an independent translator. You want to be 100% certain that you understand the full content of what you are signing.You can find a list of accredited translators on the website of the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\n, Work with your lawyer to lower the price as much as possible, regardless of the type of construction you are purchasing.\n\n\nOff-plan property \u2013 You will want to negotiate any input you will have into the style of construction, as well as a clause stipulating that you can withhold 5% of the price at the signing of the deeds, to be paid after the developer has fixed any problems you identify in the construction.\nRe-sale property \u2013 Negotiate the price, the undeclared value (the amount of the price to be paid under the table and not declared in the deed \u2013 try to avoid paying it if possible and never go over 10%), deadlines, who pays the plusvalia (a municipal tax on the increase in land value, usually paid by the seller), any extra fixtures included in the price, access to the property before closing (so that your architect can start estimating the cost of remodeling), and the deposit method (it is best to pay to a third party, preferably a lawyer, who will hold the funds in escrow until the sale is complete).New property \u2013 Negotiate the price, undeclared value, deadlines, the pusvalia, and the deposit method.\n\n, This is the point of no return, after which there will be serious financial implications to backing out. Do not rush into it. Before signing anything, be sure you have had your lawyer look over it. Don\u2019t allow developers or real estate agents to pressure you into signing without due diligence. The UK government offers a helpful checklist of things to consider before signing.\n\n\nIt is recommended to visit the property you plant to purchase and to sign all the necessary contracts in person at the notary\u2019s office, but this is not always possible. The easiest alternative is to have someone represent you as a \u2018verbal representative\u2019 (representante verbal). Soon after the purchase, you will need to ratify the representation at a Spanish Consulate in your own country or at the Spanish notary\u2019s office when next you visit Spain. Completing a power of attorney is also possible, though not recommended.Off-plan property \u2013 Don\u2019t sign a reservation contract (which take the property off the market for 30 days) in return for a fee (usually 6,000 euros) unless it has a clause stating that the deposit will be returned if you do not proceed. The point of no return is the payment construction contract (contrato de compraventa de vivienda en construccion). Be sure to have your lawyer do due diligence before signing. This contract is accompanied by a first payment of around 25% of the price, plus IVA. The remaining payments will be made in stages or all at once when you sign the deed, depending on how you negotiate the contract.Resale or new property - Your lawyer should perform due diligence before you sign a private contract with the seller and pay the initial deposit (generally 10%). Afterwards, you will have 1 to 3 months to get your funds in place. You will then transfer the remaining funds, sign the deeds before a notary, and take possession of the property. Finally, you will register your title and pay any relevant taxes., Congratulations! Now that you have the keys to your new Spanish property, you can start the process of remodeling it and furnishing it, whether for your own purposes or to serve as a rental property.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":906}
{"text":" On the other hand, if she starts the conversation too often, she might not be interested, either. When a girl likes a guy, she will likely try to show her interest without being too obvious or looking too needy. As a result, she will start at least half of your conversations if not most, but probably won't start all of them. If a girl does start all of them, it could be a sign that she is not worried about seeming needy because she only sees you as a friend.;\n, Even if the girl is tempted to hang on your every word, most girls will resist the urge. If anything, a girl who likes you is more likely to end a text conversation first in an effort to show that she is interesting and has an engaging social life even without you. When a girl ends most texting conversations with something like, \"Gotta go, I'm heading to movie with my bff,\" she could be interested. If, however, she just stops texting instead of saying good-bye, she is probably not interested.\n\n, A formal count is not necessary, of course, but make a mental note of how often she uses emoticons and which ones she uses most. The most often used emoticon a girl will flirt with is the winking face. The more often she uses an emoticon wink, the more likely it is that she has a thing for you. Standard smiles may or may not mean the same thing, but large smiles are another good sign. A blushing emoticon and a \"kiss face\" emoticon may also frequent her texts if she likes you\n\n, If she quickly turns the conversation to herself, she might not be interested. Similarly, if she gives super quick answers like \"K\" or frequently leaves the conversation with little more than a \"brb,\" she probably is not very interested. If she regularly jokes back with you when you say something funny, though, or asks you questions to keep the conversation, it demonstrates that she wants to keep talking to you for as long as possible.\n\n,, If most of her texts are practical, such as question about assignments, then she may not be interested. On the other hand, if her texts are personal and ask about your personal life, she might be interested. This is especially true if she recalls specific details you previously mentioned to her about your plans. Another promising type of text is the random question. Look for something of no significance, like, \"Would you rather live on nothing but your least favorite food for a year or give up your favorite food for the rest of your life?\" These questions are fairly unimportant, and if she asks a bunch of them, it could be a sign that she is looking for an excuse to talk to you because you are on her mind.\n\n, Specifically, look at how often she uses exclamation points. More exclamation points indicates more excitement at the opportunity to talk to you, which could signify that she likes you. A \"Hey you!\" is infinitely more promising than a simple, \"Hey.\"\n\n, Not every girl does it, but many girls add extra vowels and consonants onto words. For instance, she might text words like \"heyyyy,\" \"riiiiiight,\" \"pleeeeeaaassseee,\" \"hiiiiii\" or \"byyyyeee.\" The idea is to mimic the elongation of words often used in real-life flirtatious banter.\n\n, Any text laughter is a good sign, but there are some that are better signs than others. Standard abbreviations like \"LOL,\" \"ROTFL,\" or \"LMAO\" can be sent to just about anyone, friend or crush alike. A \"haha\" is a better sign, because she wants you to actually imagine her laughing. A \"hehe\" or \"teehee\" is even better. These two forms of text laughing are the equivalent of a real-life giggle, rather than a loud laugh, and a girl is more likely to text you a \"giggle\" if she wants to sound cute.\n\n, A common hint dropped via text is the invitation to meet in person. An actual invite to a party is good, but an even better invitation is the random \u201con the fly\u201d sort, in which she casually mentions something like, \u201cI think I\u2019ll head to the pool. Meet me there?\u201d These messages may seem casual, but in actuality, they usually indicate that she wants to see you and only you, and now. A strong desire to see you is a pretty good hint that she is interested.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":907}
{"text":" You don't have to have a monstrous kit with a gong like Neil Peart from Rush to get started drumming. You don't even have to have a kit at all. To get started on the basics, use your hands and tops of your thighs in a seated position to learn basic drum-kit rhythms. Listen to music with obvious rhythms and try to mock the rhythm with your hands.\n\n\nMany beginners can get frustrated upon plopping down behind a kit and not being able to play a simple rhythm yet. It's a good idea to start getting some sense of rhythm before dropping the cash on a big drum kit to practice on, or before giving yourself an opportunity to get frustrated.;\n, There are many ways to break down a a musical bar, but for the purposes of getting started, we'll discuss 4\/4 time signature, meaning that there are 4 beats in a measure. Tap out 4 equal beats with one hand. These are quarter notes.\n\n\nCount out loud when you're just getting started. It's important to keep track of the rhythm and learn what you're playing, allowing you to develop more complex awareness of beat.\nIt's a good idea to use a metronome or a click track to practice rhythms. They're easy to find online, in GarageBand, or on your phone, or by playing along to songs.\n\n, Each quarter note is made up of two eighth notes. Keep tapping that simple quarter note beat with one hand and then try eighth notes at the same beat. These are counted \"1-and-2-and-3-and-4-and...\" Try your best to say it steadily and beat it with your hand.\n\n, Continue with your first hand, counting out eighth notes. Now, whenever you say \"Two\" and \"Four,\" tap the table or the top of your thigh with your other hand. This fills in where you'll be hitting the snare when you sit behind a kit.\n\n, Continue tapping with both hands, but now whenever you say \"One\" or \"Three\", tap your right (or left) foot. This is called the downbeat, and is what you'll tap out on the bass drum.\n\n\nYou're playing a simple rock-style drum beat! Learning drums is broken into two big categories of things you need to learn: rhythm and technique. You can't learn technique without a drum kit, but you can learn about rhythm. By learning everything you can about rhythms and developing your sense of keeping a beat and counting before you ever sit behind a drum kit, you'll be a better drummer and be able to learn more quickly.\n\n, Each kit is different, using different kinds of drums that make up a set. There are different brands, sizes, sticks used, and different tunings among other slighter modifications that will affect the overall sound of each instrument. Still, many drum kits employ basically the same fundamental pieces. Most basic kits include:\n\n\nA bass drum, which makes the low-pitched booming sound when struck by a weighted mallet operated by a foot pedal.\nA snare drum, usually located to the non-dominant side of the drummer and played with the drummer's non-dominant stick. The snare is a tight, bright drum with a band of rattling metal beads under the drum head. Typically, the snare is known for its crisp \"click\" sound followed by the \"resonating shuffle\" of the beads.\nThere are many types of tom-tom drums, but the most common three are the Floor Tom (the deepest of the three), the Mid-Tom (the medium of the three), and the High-Tom (the most high-pitched of the three). A very basic kit may only have the floor tom, while others may have many. They're tuned differently to create an array of different deeper noises for fills.\n\n, There are many different kinds of cymbals, varying in type, shape, and sound. A cymbal is a round, metal object that resonates when struck. The four most commonly used types of cymbals are the hi-hat, the ride, the splash, and the crash.\n\n\nThe hi-hat is a pair of cymbals mounted on a foot pedal. The foot pedal is usually played by the left foot and controls the cymbals, bringing them together when pressed and bringing them apart when released. You can strike the cymbal when it is apart or closed, and you can shut the cymbals with your feet at different rates of speed, each creating a different sound.\nThe ride cymbal creates a more subtle and deeper sound than the other cymbals because it is used to play very repetitively throughout most music. The cymbal will usually resonate from one strike to another, featuring a very long reverberating \"finish\" to the sound.\nThe splash is a cymbal that creates a metallic \"splashing\" sound, similar to the sound a water splash makes. It dies quickly after peaking and is typically used in basic fills to ornament your beat.\nThe crash is similar to the splash, but usually generates a loud and long, sustained sound. Listen for the crash at the end of measures in pop music or especially in periods of heightened drama in orchestral music.\n\n, There are two main ways to hold drum sticks, called the matched grip and the traditional grip.\n\n\nIn the matched grip, you hold the sticks between your thumb and index finger a few inches from the bottom of the sticks. Wrap your remaining fingers around the sticks. Be sure the back side of your hands are facing up rather than facing to the side. This method is the most common way of holding sticks, allowing you plenty of wrist control and comfort.\nIn the traditional grip, you'll hold the stick in your non-dominant hand by resting the stick in the cradle between your thumb and index finger and on top of your ring finger. Wrap your thumb, index and middle fingers around the stick. Hold the other stick using a matched grip. Some jazz drummers use a traditional grip to offer a different kind of control on the snare drum, playing intricate rhythms on it as part of fills.\n\n, If you are interested in drumming, price many different new and used options before you spend the money on a set. Talk to the people at the stores and they should steer you in the right direction. Start out with a cheap, new set or a used set until you finally decide if you are going to stick with it.\n\n\nYou can also consider joining your school band to have access to the equipment and lessons to help you learn. You might even ask in your band department if you'd be allowed to practice a few times on a kit because you're interested in the drums. The music folk are generally friendly people, and it can't hurt to ask.\n\n, There are a lot out there, but there is no right or wrong stick. 5A is a good stick weight for beginners.\n\n\nHave your drum teacher or the people at the store give you some pointers on how to hold the sticks, how to hit the drum properly, how to adjust the drums to fit your stature, and how to set up your kit at home. You can also find a lot of this information for free on the internet.\n\n, Good posture will make you more comfortable during practice and help you reach the drums more easily. You'll sound better and enjoy playing more by improving your posture.\n\n\nSit up straight and keep your elbows in. Stay in tight to the kit, keeping the floor pedals at a comfortable distance from you.\n\n, This can't be stressed enough: you need to learn to play a steady, even tempo and the easiest way to beat that into your brain is by practicing with a metronome. If you can't afford a metronome, you can find a click track somewhere which is a recorded metronome that you can play in your stereo, on your Walkman, or on your computer while you practice.\n\n, Play the 8th notes on the hi-hat, hitting the snare drum on 2 and 4, and pressing the bass drum pedal with your foot on the 1 and 3.\n\n\nMake sure you count out loud when you are playing. Eventually you won't have to, but do it while you are learning and when you are practicing.\nTo mix it up and get familiar with the kit, hit something else on the \"Two\" and on the \"Four\" instead of the snare drum, hit everywhere else.\nTry to develop a groove and get used to playing evenly, while counting out loud and while playing with the click.\n\n, Learn how to close the hi-hat with the left foot when you strike it with your hands. It makes a different, shorter sound. This is the position at which most drummers use the hi-hat most frequently.\n\n\nPlay straight eighth notes with the right hand. Use the left hand and hit the snare on \"Two\" and \"Four\". Lift your foot off of the hi-hat here and there to get used to the sounds you are making. You can open it all the way, open it a little and hit the hi-hat in different places such as the outside rim, or the bell at the top to get different sounds.\n\n, At the same time you hit the hi-hat, learn to work in bass drum rhythms to help develop the muscles.\n\n\nTry to play with the right hand and foot at the same time, left hand free styling, or with all limbs at the same time to really get your muscles used to moving.\n\n, Play the same thing above, but instead of hitting the snare on the \"Two\" and \"Four\" hit the hi-hat. When you are lifting your right hand off the hi-hat move your left hand down to hit the snare. Now you are basically playing the snare drum in between each hit of the hi-hat.\n\n\nWhile you are doing this count out loud \"One e and a Two e and a Three e and a Four e and a\" continuing to hit the hi-hat with the right hand on the \"One and Two and Three and Four and\" but hitting the snare on the \"es and as.\"\n\n, If you notice any tension, or you're struggling to keep up with the beats at the RPM you've set the metronome at, slow down the metronome until you feel relaxed.\n\n, The basic \"single\" stroke and a \"double\" stroke are absolutely essential to developing your limb independence and drum complexity. If you strike the drum with one beat from each alternating hand, you have a single stroke pattern. However, if you strike the drum with one downward movement from each alternating hand and let the stick bounce on each alternating stroke to get two hits per stroke, you have a double stroke pattern.\n\n\nThis is what enables a drummer to perform very fast rolls and patterns. By studying and practicing the 26 American drum rudiments, you will be well on your way to mastering single, double, triple and quadruple stroke patterns.\n\n, It can be a bit like rubbing your belly and patting your head, but learning drums means that you've eventually got to do more complicated things all at once. Instead of making one movement up and one movement down you may have to double or triple or even quadruple one movement with a limb while the other limbs do something else in another direction.\n\n\nCount the same beat you've been using so far with eighth notes, and on every beat close the hi-hat with your left foot and open it on the offbeats, or \"ands\". Hit the snare drum on the twos and fours to make a basic rock beat. With your right hand keep 8th note time (one and two and three and four and) on the rim of the snare or on a ride cymbal if you have one.\n\n, Experiment with various beats with the right foot while keeping the rest of the limbs locked in the main pattern. This is where it starts to get tricky. Don't worry though, it gets easier the more you play. You have to get your limbs used to making movements that are independent of each other. There is no quick way to do this. Just take your time and think about what you are doing. If you break it down into one beat at a time it makes things a lot easier.\n\n, For quarter note triplets you must think in terms of half notes. Count 1-la-le evenly in the space of the half note. For eighth note triplets it's the same, but with three notes split in the space of a quarter note.\n\n\nTriplets are not used that much in rock beats but you will find them in drum fills and used in percussion lines found in school bands. Basically a triplet is where you play 3 notes in the time you usually play 2. you can have quarter note triplets, 8th note triplets, 16th note triplets, 32nd note triplets.\nWe have a cool sounding beat with 8th note triplets. They are counted \"\" or any three syllable word. Play this along with the metronome each click on the metronome is a beat and each beat is subdivided.\n\n, 16th notes are basically what you played earlier when you were learning to move your hands in opposite directions. These are counted \"\"\n\n\n16th note triplets are counted , 32nd notes should be counted \"[4 e + a + e + a}\n\n\nThere are 32nd note triplets that require a lot of subdivision to count and are pretty much too fast to say out loud, but if you want to hear some 32nd notes and 32nd not triplets, then listen to the song \"Hey Joe\" by Jimi Hendrix. These notes are hard to play correctly because you need to be able to play them evenly, making the same sound on the drums with each hand and be able to move around the drum kit playing these notes in time with the rest of the song.\n\n, Each click will be quarter beat and easy to keep time by the time you get to the higher subdivisions you will be counting faster or playing faster but the numbers you say will always land on the clicks of the metronome.\n\n, Listen to some of your favorite songs and use a small subdivision such as the 8th or 16th note count and you will see that during a lot of the fills you will hear spaces where there is silence when you are counting. These are the rests.\n\n, When you play an accented note with the right hand it should sound the same when you play with the left and when you make a normal stroke with the right it will sound the same as the left and vice versa and so on.\n\n\nAn accented stroke is when you strike the drum harder than the other strokes (usually on the rim of the drum, also known as a rimshot). Accents give a very dynamic effect to the music. In music notation, accents are shown by the mathematical \"greater than\" sign (>).\n\n, The purpose of a drum fill is to add a little flair to a song. A guitar player plays a hot little lick and a singer might shout and dance about, and the drummer plays fills. These happen in time between the beats, usually on the toms and the cymbals. Listen to John Bonham to hear the master of drum fills.\n\n, Play \"1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\" and play as you did before with right hand on the hi-hat and left on the snare. Use the right foot on the kick. Repeat as you warm up. Now continue counting out loud and just play \"1 + 2 +\" and then stop playing with your limbs and just finish counting out loud \"3 + 4 +\"repeat.\n\n\nIt should sound like \"Boom tic Pap tic\" now on the \"3 + 4 +\" do anything else for example start with moving every limb at the same time on the \"3 + 4 +\" you can hit the crash (if you have one) on the one on the following bar and you will have pulled off your first fill.\n\n, Do every combination and variation on this basic theme, while counting the \"3 + 4 +\". Some will sound good to you some won't. Some basic ones can be all snare alternating hands. Two kick and then two snares. Two snares and two kicks. As long as you keep the time it doesn't matter what you pick as long as the time stays even.\n\n, Continue to play the \"1 + 2 +\" as you did above. Now pick a couple subdivisions of the beat as written out between the brackets above for the \"3\" beat and the \"4\" beat\" such as \"[4 e + a} play note while counting out loud and use all limbs at the same time as you did above.\n\n\nNow pick other subdivisions for the \"3\" and 4\" beat you can go \"\" or \"\" or \"\" or whatever. Is it starting to get easier yet? As long as the notes are played evenly and within the time you have lots and lots of possible combinations for the fills.\nYou don't have to just play the beat and beat as fills. You can play the whole bar as a fill picking any of the subdivisions for each beat and combining them such as \"\" or whatever you picked. Say the subdivisions out loud then play with all limbs and then play around with using different sounds and sound combinations for the subdivisions.\n\n, Learn to hold back on fills, even if you're a killer drummer. AC\/DC songs feature extremely simple fills or no fills at all, which fits in perfectly with their no-frills reputation as a band. It would sound ridiculous if \"Back in Black\" featured a drum solo.\n\n\nYou don't have to start a fill at the beginning of a beat. Count \" One and Two\" and play it like you did before with the right hand on the hi-hat and the left on the snare but when you get to the \"and three and four and\" play the fill starting on that and instead of waiting for the \"three\" beat.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":908}

{"text":" If your body is not limber during a back handspring, there's a chance you won't adjust properly to the flip. Regardless of the sport you're practicing for, it's always important to give your body a bit of a warm up before the fact.\n\n\nStretch and roll your wrists. This is the area that risks the most strain when you execute your back handspring, so it's a good idea to give it some extra love prior to attempting the technique.;\n, A hard surface won't give you the cushion you need to spring back, and the risks of injury are much higher. Investing in a mat will allow you to practice your back handsprings from virtually any location.\n\n, To do a needle kick, raise your knees, and launch your leg out in a kicking motion. Repeat this 15-20 times for each leg to complete a full set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing a set of these before attempting a back handspring will ensure your leg muscles are properly warmed up for the technique.\n\n, A trampoline offers a safe, welcoming arena to practice your backflips. If you're relatively new to back handsprings and flips in general, practicing them on a trampoline helps to alleviate the fear of injuring yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, You should practice these as part of your regular workout. Aim your arms downward and lay your hands flat on the ground. Holding your hands in place, launch yourself forward and lift your legs off the ground. Handstands can be held for several seconds or longer if you have the flexibility and strength. They may take a long time to master, but it's a necessary step to take if you want to get good at back handsprings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining up your handstand balance will make it easier to control the stage of a back handspring when your hands meet the ground. Being used to the experience of a handstand will make the back handspring feel more fluid.\nTraining yourself with 20 second handstands in reps of 5 is a good place to start if you already have the basics figured out., A vault board will give you the extra force necessary to achieve a flip. This will allow you to focus on other facets of your technique.\n\n\nUsing a vault board can help you to focus on improving your control, rather than putting the effort into the force of jumping itself. This is particularly helpful if you have difficulty with the initial leap.\n\n, Rest your back against wall, and lower your body down. This will cause a bend in your legs. Get your squat down to the point where your legs are arched at a 90 degree angle. This should cause a noticeable burn in your leg muscles.\n\n\nIf your legs are stronger, you'll be able to leap higher, giving your back handspring greater initial force.\nHold your squat for 30 seconds, then give yourself 30 seconds to rest before you attempt another rep.\n\n, Whether at a subscription gym or as part of a gymnastics team, getting help from a coach can take you from being good to great. It is especially helpful if you have a positive working relationship with the coach. Many coaches find satisfaction in seeing their students thrive. This can have a positive moralizing effect on you if you're feeling frustrated by the learning curve.\n\n\nHaving a coach around can also help limit the risk of personal injury if he doubles as a spotter.\n\n, It's a common mistake for beginning gymnasts to bend their backs as they execute this manoeuvre. Unfortunately, this makes it more difficult for your body's weight to complete the flip, and you have an increased risk of injury if your spine is at an arc.\n\n, If you have had some training doing wall squats, the wall squat position is the stance you'll want to be in as you launch yourself backwards. Bring your legs to a near-90 degree angle. This will maximize your body's force as you launch upwards.\n\n, This reduces the risk of injury. It also helps ensure that your weigh is evenly displaced on both sides. If your head is turned one way or another, you will have a tendency to shift your body's weight in that direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, This will offer you the opportunity of analyzing your technique objectively. There may be things you notice yourself doing on video that you weren't conscious about when you were doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Tumbling and round-offs are just a couple of the techniques gymnasts tend to combine back handsprings with. Although juggling multiple techniques at once ups the challenge, you'll know you have mastered the handspring itself when you're able to combine it with ease.\n\n, Regular, sufficient sleep is especially important if you're into athletics. Getting between 7-9 hours is optimal, although you may want more if you have a particularly straining athletics test the next day.\n\n\nWith proper rest, you'll be able to execute greater back handsprings with less conscious effort.\n\n, If you have a friend who is training in the same skills you are, you'll be able to help each other. One of you can act as a spotter while the other executes the techniques. Above all, the moralizing aspect of training as a team will push you past the boundaries you thought you had.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Drinking ample water helps to ensure that your joints are lubricated. If you're dehydrated, your body won't function at the level it should.\n\n\nAmple water intake will loosen up your joints, giving your body greater flexibility when you attempt a back handspring.\nSome athletes believe you should multiply your body weight by 0.6 to arrive at the number of ounces you should be drinking each day if you're wanting to get serious about athletics., If you feel like you're not cut out for a back handspring, you'll have a low chance of pulling it off regardless of your physical aptitude. Go into each training session with a positive outlook. You should take comfort in the fact you are going out of your way to hone your body and improve yourself.\n\n\nBack handsprings are difficult, and require a fair amount of focus on the part of the gymnast. If you have issues with self-confidence, clearing up the emotional aspect will see tangible improvements in your technique.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":914}
{"text":" It will represent who you are throughout the site so something clever will score you points, while something raunchy will only attract the wrong type of people. Most sites also offer a Heading\/Catch Phrase\/Tag Line that appears in the searches to draw people into your profile. Humor often works best. It engages people by creating a reaction in their mind of laughter, a pleasure-seeking bait of wanting to laugh more if they read what else you have to say. I myself used: \u201cWe can always say we met at the supermarket\u201c, or something quirky like: \u201cSeeking out all the toilet paper scrunchers!\u201c\n\n,\n\n\nA lot of us introverts are camera shy but having a photo is essential for any online dating profile. In most sites you can choose to filter people out without a photo. Whenever someone performs a search for a match, the only details that appear in the search results are your username, age, location, tagline and your photo. So what will make a person take more interest in learning more about you than any of the other 50 profiles in the search result? How attractive they find you. Selecting a photo with someone significantly less attractive than yourself would create the perfect perceptual contrast of increasing your appeal.\n\n, But for the more ethical:\n\n\nCurrent photos are ideal. Many people use old photos of their former and more attractive selves. It\u2019s an ingenious idea at the beginning\u2026 until you have to meet the person you\u2019re talking with, and have to reassure them that they didn\u2019t sleep in and arrive 20 years late for your date\u2026\nMore than one photo allows for people to get a more three dimensional idea of what you look like in different contexts. Preferably include at least one head shot and one full body shot.\nBe original and grab people's attention to receive higher responses. This could be perfect if you\u2019re a bit shy and don\u2019t want to show a picture of yourself. For example, you could put one picture up of you wearing a costume, or one where you draw a smiley face on a piece of paper and cover your face with it. These kinds of pictures will add a touch of quirky playfulness, while adding a sense of mystery so that people want more.\nDetails in picking the image will make all the difference. If you\u2019re aiming at attracting geeks or nerds then photos with your glasses on or playing your favorite video games will work wonders. If you\u2019d like an adventurer like yourself, a photo of yourself rock climbing is perfect. Also keep in mind the small things like lighting in the photo, clothes you\u2019re wearing and even the size of your pupils. A psychology study analyzing pupil sizes discovered that we find large pupils more inviting and attractive, just as I mentioned in another article.;\n, How often have you seen the same repetitive: \u201cI love to have fun and be spontaneous!!!\u201c, as opposed to what? Not liking to have fun? And saying you\u2019re spontaneous makes it sound planned. Listing sports, movies, music and travel as your interests is uninteresting, most people like a certain sport, movie, song or place to go to. Also, generalizing your tastes by saying for instance \u201cI like all kinds of music\u201d is just a falsified cover-up to make yourself appear that you\u2019re cultured, when in fact you\u2019re actually dispassionate and boring. Writing: \u201cI like to visit India because it\u2019s such an ancient culture rich with variety, spirituality, acceptance and color\u201d would be much more revealing of who you are. Here are some helpful hints:\n\n,\n\n\nThe opening lines are pivotal for the success of your self bio. Just like in many writing formats, how you open your paragraphs will either hook your reader in and entice them to read further or will dull them away. It will be difficult, but craft the first sentence very carefully.\n\n, The length should preferably be around 300 words. The internet generation is one of impatience, nobody likes reading 3-mouse-scroll-downs lengths of text. Too little text however and you\u2019ll come across as empty, lazy, lifeless and boring. Too much and you\u2019re obsessive, psycho and neurotic.\n\n, Spelling is one of the pet-peeves of many. Spelling words correctly makes your writing flow a lot more smoothly, as does using punctuation and new paragraphs. If your reader unconsciously feels the tension of having to decipher your spelling mistakes, then that anxiety will also influence their perception of you. Furthermore, your choice of words can change the meaning of what you want to convey entirely. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die alone\u201d is a common fear. \u201cI want someone to die with\u201d is a suicide pact.\n\n, If you consider yourself caring, instead of writing that, why not share that you enjoy cooking for your parents or coaching your nephews soccer team?\n\n, For instance: what it is you aspire to do in life, what hobbies bring you the greatest joy, what qualities you value in others. The more important things you reveal about yourself, whether favorite movie or favorite ice cream flavor, the more chances someone will read your profile and think: \u201cwow, this person sounds so much like me\u201c.\n\n, Instead of stating: \u201cNo old creepy men\u201d, \u201cI\u2019d like someone around my age to be able to grow old with\u201d sounds much more warm and positive. Instead of \u201cNo non-christians\u201d, \u201cMy religion plays a huge role in my life\u201d is much more welcoming.\n\n, Be unique.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":915}
{"text":" By now you've probably been looking at colleges and have a few potential ones in mind. Find out what each school's required SAT score for entry is. This will give you a goal score.There are several ways to get this information.\n\n\nSchools often publish this information on official websites, usually under the \"Admissions\" section. If you can't find what you need on the school websites, try doing an internet search of the school's name and \"SAT score requirement.\" This way you can avoid searching around the school websites.\nCall or email the school's admissions office and ask for their SAT score requirements. There are advisers there whose job it is to answer any questions prospective students may have, so you shouldn't be shy about asking them for information.\nSome schools don't have a minimum score for entry. If this is the case, use these methods to find the average SAT scores for their incoming freshman class. This will give you an idea of what you should aim for.\nIf there is a lot of variation in the scores each school requires, make the highest one your goal. That way, you'll cover all your bases.;\n, There are a number of quality SAT review books available at most book stores and local libraries.Some top test books include:College Board Official SAT Study Guide. Also known as the Blue Book, this prep book is published by the company that makes the SAT. It contains 10 full-length tests. It is known to be particularly useful for math sections, because it contains detailed descriptions of every problem. It also comes with a DVD that has further advice and tips.\nKaplan SAT Premier. This has eight full tests with explanations to answers. It also comes with a companion DVD, offering videos with further explanation.\nGruber's Complete SAT Guide. This book focuses on test taking techniques that will improve your scores and help you find the right answers quickly. In addition, it has five full tests.\nBaron's SAT. Baron's publishes quality books for almost all standardized tests. The SAT book explains all answers, but is known for having a high-quality reading section. The 2015 edition had five full tests, plus another two on the companion CD.\nIt is best to use a combination of these books and others. That way, you'll maximize your chances of seeing the most questions possible.\nMake sure these books were published in or after 2005. The SAT was reformatted in 2005 and older books, while still helpful, won't prepare you for this new version as well as a current book.\n\n, While it may seem strange to do this before any prep, doing this will give you a good idea of what your strengths and weaknesses are. It will also give you the baseline score you need to improve.Make sure you're in a quiet area where you won't be disturbed at all. and you have several hours to devote to this. Time yourself and stick to the time requirements.\nThe full SAT is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\nThere is a 70 minute math section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.\nThere is a 70 minute critical reading section. This breaks down into two 25 minute parts and one 20 minute part.\nThere is a 60 minute writing section. This breaks down to two 25 minute parts and one 10 minute part.\nThere is a 25 minute experimental section. This is ungraded, but you should still complete it so you can build up your endurance.\nYou are allowed three 5 minute breaks, one after each section. During this time you're allowed to stretch, go to the bathroom, and have a drink and snack. Only eat or drink during breaks to accurately recreate the testing experience.\nStick carefully to these time limits. One of your problems could be that you have trouble finishing in the allotted time, so you'll need to know if this is something you have to improve on.\n\n, This is more than a matter of finding out what your score is. You need to go through the test and find out exactly where you made mistakes. As you move on and work to improve your grade, you'll need to know where your trouble spots are and where you need to focus your efforts., Many students decide to self-prep, which is essentially just utilizing study guides to prepare for the SAT. However, many people fall short of their goals, and in some cases a quality prep course would have significantly improved a students chances of scoring higher on their SAT. A student must assess whether or not they need that extra push to study effectively. Prep courses do a great job at holding students accountable and keeping them engaged.\n\n\nIf you are the student that has a history of not following through with studying or has trouble staying focused, then a prep course might be your best bet. If you do decide to use a prep course, it's extremely important to consider many factors when assessing what prep course might be the best for you.\nOne of the most important factors to pay attention to is whether or not you're getting quality content with your prep course purchase. There are many companies trying to get in the prep course game, but they all don't have the same level of content quality. Make sure to do your research on the company before you make a prep course purchase, and seriously consider trying to get access to a free trial before making your prep course purchase.\n\n, There are many words that repeat themselves from year to year. If you read enough practice tests, chances are good that when you take the test you've seen a majority of the words before.You don't need to purchase these practice books- you can just flip through these sections at the bookstore or library.\nCollege Board, the company that designs the SAT, offers free sample test questions and sections on its website., Keep a notebook and write down words you don't know as you come across them. Take a dictionary and define them afterwards. Also include whether the word is a noun, verb, etc.Set up your book in columns. Draw a line down the middle of the page to divide the columns. Put the words on the left, and the definitions on the right. This way, you can either put a piece of paper or your hand over the definitions while you study.\nMake sure your notebook is small enough to conveniently carry around with you. That way, any down time you have can be used for study.\nYou could also try a few websites dedicated to improving vocabulary. That way you can access them on your smartphone anywhere., Set time aside to work on your vocabulary. Go through your notebook, cover the definitions, and define as many words as you can without looking.\n\n\nFor words you don't know, say the definitions aloud a few times to help you remember them for next time.\nUse the words in a sentence. This will not only help you understand their meanings, but prepare you to use them in your essay and in the reading comprehension sections.\nUse the words in everyday life. When you get comfortable with a word's definition, put it to use. When these words become normal parts of your vocabulary, they'll be much easier to figure out on the SAT.\n\n, Many companies that publish review books also make vocabulary flashcards. They can usually fit easily in your pocket or bag, so they may be more convenient to carry around than your notebook.\n\n, With apps, you'll always have a study resource at your fingertips. For example, SAT and ACT Vocabulary Builder by AccelaStudy uses a dynamic approach to flashcards by specifically focusing on words you've had trouble with., Sentence completion questions have one or two blank spaces. You have to pick the word or words that best complete the sentence. Improving your vocabulary will help here, but it's unlikely you'll know all the words. That's why it's important to know some strategies to help you break down sentences and pick the right answer.\n\n, You don't need to know the definitions of the words most of the time, you just need the context the sentence provides., A clause is a part of a sentence that contains a noun and a verb, and conveys a complete idea. The sentence completion questions almost always present you with compound sentences, meaning they contain two or more clauses. The clauses are usually linked by a conjunction, which are words like \"but,\" \"and,\" \"so,\" and \"because.\"For example: \"I went to the store, but it was closed.\" This sentence contains two clauses, linked by the conjunction \"but.\"\n\n, The type of conjunction tells you how the clauses are related.One-way switch. These conjunctions tell you that the sentence flows in one direction. That means the clauses both support the main idea of the sentence. Some one-way switches are: and, because, since, so, and therefore.\nHere's a one-way switch: \"I got in my car and drove to work.\" The \"and\" tells us that the two clauses support each other.\nTwo-way switch. This type of conjunction tells us that there will be a break in the sentence's flow. That means the second clause will negate something in the first. Some of these are: but, although, despite, however, and while.\nHere's a two-way switch: \"I got in my car but it wouldn't start.\" The \"but\" tells us that the second clause will be inconsistent with the first. Presumably, this person got in their car to go somewhere, but they now can't go anywhere because the car won't start.\nSentences without a switch are all one-way, unless they're about change over time. Sentences that describe change over time are two-way.\n\n, Now that you know how to break down a sentence, you can start working out how to solve a sentence completion question. Using the rules about one-and two-way switches, figure out the flow of the sentence.\n\n\n\"Johnny didn't even know how to ride a bike, but he _____ the race anyway.\" The \"but\" tells us that we have a two-way switch here. Already, without even seeing any choices, you know that the right choice will contrast with Johnny not knowing how to ride a bike.\n\n, That way, you can pick the choice most like the word you had in mind.\n\n, When you've broken the sentence down, figured out its flow, and picked a word to complete it, then look at the choices. All the previous steps will make it much easier to spot the correct choice.\n\n\nIf you're completely stuck on vocabulary, start eliminating choices. Even if you have to guess, every choice you eliminate makes your chances better.\n\n, These are usually the typical length and difficulty of SAT reading sections. Read an article and understand its point.Ask yourself what the main idea of the article is.\nAfter deciding on the main idea, make the article's scope more specific. If you read about volcanoes in Hawaii, saying that the article was about Earth science is too broad. In a short sentence, say the article's topic and scope.\nIf you're unsure that you understood an article properly, ask a teacher or tutor to read it. Then tell them the short summary sentence you came up with. They can tell you if you've properly understood the article or if you made a mistake somewhere.\nMake notes next to the article to help yourself comprehend it better.\n\n, You don't get to pick the topics for the reading comprehension sections, so chances are good you'll find at least one of the sections very boring. Unfortunately, we tend to skim and not pay attention to topics we have no interest in, which could lead you to get questions wrong. Get yourself used to paying attention to boring topics by purposely reading things you don't find interesting., There are a few types of questions the SAT usually asks. Understanding these can help you figure out the answer.Main Idea. These ask about the point of the article as a whole.\nInference. This will ask you about something that isn't directly stated in the article, but rather implied.\nDetail. These will ask you about a specific section of the article.\nVocabulary. These will ask you to define a word based on how it is used in the passage.\nFunction. These ask you about the purpose of a specific part of the passage.\n\n, We all think differently, and there really isn't one golden rule on how to tackle reading comprehension sections. All strategies have positives and negatives. Try these on your practice tests and see which one works best for you.Read through passages fully, then move onto the questions.\nRead the questions first, then read the passages.\nSkim the passage, then read the questions and refer back to the passage when you have to.\nIf one strategy isn't working for you, try another.\n\n, Because the SAT has strict time constraints, you shouldn't read every word of every passage. Use the following techniques to get all the necessary information in the shortest amount of time.Read the introduction paragraph. This should layout the main idea and topic of the passage.\nOnly read the first and last sentences of paragraphs after this. Effectively constructed paragraphs will give an introduction that summarizes the paragraph, and a conclusion that wraps it up.\nCircle or underline important words or terms. Key terms will vary from passage to passage and will be based on the passage's main idea. For example, if you're reading a passage about climate change, terms like \"rising sea levels,\" \"greenhouse gas,\" and \"pollution\" will likely be important.\n\n, Longer passages usually have several paragraphs. Each paragraph has a particular topic in relation to the main idea of the reading. Take only a few seconds to come up with a very fast, one-sentence summary of each paragraph. That way, if questions ask about a particular section of the passage, you know exactly where to go., Since you've read the passage, you'll probably have an idea of what the right answer is. Find the answer that best matches your prediction. This will prevent you from wasting time by referring back to the passage looking for answers., Many students have trouble sticking to the time constraints in reading comprehension sections. If it takes you more than a minute to answer a question, skip it, or you risk running out of time. If you can eliminate even one choice, then it is best to take a guess., Just like with vocabulary words, there are a limited number of math questions the SAT can ask, so over the years there will be similar or identical questions.\n\n\nSAT Math breaks down into four areas: Numbers and Operations, Algebra, Geometry, and Data Analysis, Statistics, and Probability.There are 44 multiple choice questions and 10 fill-ins.\nMultiple choice questions give you a few opportunities to solve them. If you know how, you can solve them mathematically and pick the right answer. If you're stuck and don't know how to solve a problem, you can try substitution. This means you plug answers into the equation from the question and see what you get. Remember that SAT answers always go from lowest to highest, so this can give you an idea of which answer to start with. With multiple choice questions, you can also always guess.\nFill-ins. These have no answer choices, so this eliminates the possibility of substitution or guessing easily. You'll have to actually solve them. The best thing you can do here is study and practice your mathematical concepts., You may find that you have issues with one particular type of problem. If all the questions you get wrong are geometry, you know what you need to focus on.\n\n, It's true that the SAT booklet includes all relevant formulas.However, you still need to know when and how to use them. Just like with your vocabulary words, make note of formulas you need to know and write down what situations you would use them for.\n\n, Although you aren't graded for showing your work, this will prevent you from making careless mistakes. If you work everything out in your head, you could lose track of your work and make a preventable mistake., These can be tricky, and many students get them wrong because they are confused by the wording.\n\n\nBefore doing any work, ask yourself: \"What is this question asking me?\"That way, you can make sure you understand what exactly you're supposed to solve in this question.Write out all important parts of the question. Word problems often confuse us with unimportant sections. For instance, if a question starts with, \"John's mom put three apples in his lunchbox for school today,\" write \"3 apples.\" That way, by the end you should have a simple math problem without all the confusing wording.\n\n, This is helpful in many ways. For example, if you're in a rush and a problem asks you to calculate a certain angle, you may not have time to do a lengthy equation. However, three of the choices are acute angles and the fourth is obtuse. You see that the angle is clearly greater than a right angle. Since the figure is drawn to scale, you can correctly choose the obtuse angle., Don't rely on your imagination to visualize shapes- draw them. Like showing your work, this will help you catch mistakes before you make a careless error.,\n\n\niTooch SAT Math is an app currently for iPhones and iPads, and is under construction for Windows and Androids. It has a large database of questions and includes math games to help you practice in a more entertaining way.SAT Math Testbank. This app is compatible with Apple products. It isn't flashy and includes a large question database., The writing section asks you to take a side on a broad issue, then defend it with examples. So while grammar and spelling are important as well, what graders are looking for is how well you can support an argument., The top bun is the introduction, the middle is the body and supporting examples, the bottom bun is the conclusion.Introduction. Here you should state what your position on the debate is. It helps to rephrase the original question in some way. Then, tell the reader what your position is and why.\nBody. Here is where your examples will go. Use one paragraph per example. This is enough room to elaborate on the example and why it proves your point, but not so long that you'll take too long and won't finish.\nConclusion. Remind the reader what your position was. Explain why the examples you used demonstrate this point.\n\n, It is much better to have two well-thought out and coherent points than five jumbled and poorly considered points. It is helpful to pre-plan a few examples that are applicable in many different situations.Historical examples. In your history classes, you've probably encountered a number of people and events that would be great supporting evidence in an essay. For example, if the essay prompt is \"Can we learn from failure?\" you could say that Abraham Lincoln was a great leader because he was always willing to learn from his past mistakes.\nLiterary examples. Authors almost always include moral or social lessons in their work. You've probably read plenty of these in English class. Novels like 1984 and To Kill a Mockingbird are standards in most high schools, and contain great examples you can use in a number of different essays.\nCurrent events examples. The news is full of examples you can use in almost any argument. Good topics include censorship, military actions, political developments, and social justice.\n\n, Essays don't have to be long to be good. It will be obvious to the grader if you're just adding words and sections to make your essay longer. It's much better to have a shorter essay with strong examples than a long essay full of fluff., Although the point is to defend your position, it shows that you are a powerful writer if you can at least acknowledge the other point of view. This doesn't have to be long- even a sentence will show that you've considered other side of the issue.For example, if the question is asking whether it is right for the government to monitor its citizens, you could say, \"While many would argue that monitoring citizens is essential for national security, it is a violation of our constitutional rights.\"\n\n, Although the main point is to defend your argument, it shows a level of maturity in your writing if you can go beyond words like \"good\" and \"bad.\"Make absolutely sure, however, that you're using complicated words correctly. It could be a mark against you if you keep misusing words.\n\n, It will hurt your chances of a good score if your essay is full of grammar and spelling mistakes. Also be sure to write legibly- the grader can't give you a good score if he can't read your essay.\n\n, If writing is your weak spot, the best way to improve your score is to do write out the essay questions from SAT books and websites. Do these as if you were actually taking the test. Do not look at the question before you start. Stick to the 25 minute time limit and see if you can write an entire essay with an introduction, conclusion, and examples. Then on test day, you'll be in good shape to write an essay with little trouble., There are typically five choices for SAT answers. That means you have a 1 in 5 chance of guessing correctly. However, for every answer you eliminate, it's more likely you'll guess correctly. If you don't know an answer but are absolutely sure 4 choices are wrong, you've just found the correct answer., It's very important to understand exactly what questions are asking you. If you only breeze through or skip the instructions, you'll almost certainly make mistakes.\n\n, If you get stuck on a question and can't eliminate any choices, skip it. You'll waste time trying to figure it out when you could be answering questions you know. When you finish that section, you can come back to questions you skipped if there's time left. However, remember with every choice you eliminate your chances of guessing right improve. If you can eliminate even one answer, it is better to guess.If you skip questions, be certain you fill in the correct bubbles on your scantron as you move on. If you don't pay attention, you could end up filling in the wrong bubbles for all the questions after the one you skipped, meaning the whole section will be wrong.\n\n, The SAT is an exhausting test, so reading in general will help you. This is effective not just for reading sections, but for the whole test. It will help you keep your concentration for long periods of time.,\n\n\nBring a watch. While proctors are supposed to keep track for you, you should be sure you know exactly how much time you have left.Figure out how much time you have per question. In a 20 minute section with 25 questions, you have 48 seconds per question. Keep this in mind to see if you're falling behind and have to pick up the pace.\nIf you start running out of time, just answer easy questions. That way you'll complete the section as much as possible. You'll also probably have time to go back and work on harder ones with this method.\nBe prepared. After practicing all this time, you know the deal. You know the test's layout and what's required in each section. You've done timed practice tests. This will all help make it easier for you to finish in enough time., How long you'll spend prepping really depends on your goals. It also depends on how much free time you have for study. As a general rule, less than two weeks is not enough time for adequate prep. But you don't want to take too long either- if you start a year in advance, you'll probably forget a lot.Overall, 1 to 3 months is a good goal. This allows you enough time to let all the information sink in without risking forgetting anything., With flashcards and apps, you can study pretty much anywhere. If you're on the bus on the way to school, try doing a few math problems or flipping through some vocabulary flashcards. Little things like this can make huge differences.\n\n, If you have any questions or are having trouble in a particular area, ask your teacher in that subject for help. Teachers will be happy to give you extra help.\n\n, Working through test books by yourself may not be enough, and you might require some explanation to help you.\n\n\nMany schools offer after school classes for SAT prep. Find out if your school has one of these, or if you could get one started.\nCheck the internet and see if there are prep classes in your area. Remember that these are sometimes expensive.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":916}

If Halloween is coming up, you may also be able to find it available in the seasonal section of your local pharmacy., Decide which method you will use to create your shell and make sure you get everything you will need.\n\n\nIf you are making a shell out of a roasting pan, get a disposable aluminum roasting pan. These can be found in grocery stores and dollar stores in the baking section. Look for a pan with an oval shape which has a pattern stamped into the bottom for catching grease, which looks similar to the pattern on a shell. These are usually used for roasting large birds like turkeys.Choose your paint. You will want some dark brown and dark green spray paint. If you choose to make some color accents on your shell, you can also pick up some water-based acrylics and big paint brushes at your local hobby shop.Purchase some painters tape.

This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders.\n\n\nIf you choose to make your shell out of felt, you will need some dark green and light green felt along with a few other items. Make sure you purchase enough dark green felt to create an oval which will cover your back, as well as another oval 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) larger than the first. You will need half as much light green felt.\n\nGet a glue gun and glue sticks.\nThis method requires a sewing machine and you will want to get dark green thread if you don\u2019t already have some.\nPurchase a large bag of stuffing. Thicker stuffing used for stuffed animals is a better choice then a softer pillow stuffing.\nFind one or two large pieces of cardboard. You will need a surface large enough to create an oval large enough to cover your back. You may want two ovals of the same size to reinforce the base of your shell.\nPick up some wide dark green ribbon to match your dark green felt. You may be able to find this in the stationary section of your local Target or Walmart. You can also get ribbon at a hobby shop or fabric store. This is going to be used to strap the shell to your back. Opt for a ribbon which is strong and will be comfortable on your shoulders.\n\n\n\n, The pan is already pretty close to looking like a turtle shell, which is really convenient. It is also easily malleable if you would like to make any adjustments.\n\n\nIf the lip on the pan is really large, fold it over into the inside of the pan to reduce the squared corners. Avoid cutting this section, which could leave sharp edges.\nPush out from the inside of the pan to round out the bends in the roasting pan until the sides look more rounded like a turtle shell.\n\n, This is where the ribbon will be threaded to hold the pan on your back, so think about where the straps of a backpack would go. Put two holes in the top corners of the pan and two in the bottom. It is helpful to put the top holes and little wider apart and the bottom holes a little closer together by about one inch. This has the effect of cinching the straps near your waist. The holes should be about the size of the width of a pen or pencil.\n\n\nUse a drill to make these holes if you have one.\nThe pan can also be punctured with other sharp tools like scissors or a screwdriver.\n\n, You will want to cover both the inside and outside of the pan, as some of the inside may be visible. Spray paint the entire roasting pan with your dark brown spray paint on the inside and outside of the pan. Allow this layer to dry for about 15-20 minutes.\n\n, These will become the lines between the scales of the turtle shell and you want them to remain the dark brown color.\n\n\nIf your tape is too wide for the crevices, cut it to fit.\n\n, Don\u2019t worry about making this layer too thick. Allowing some of the brown to show through the green paint will give the shell a nice textured look.\n\n\nFor even more texture, use a large paint brush and green acrylic paint to dry brush on the green color. Squeeze the paint onto a palette and apply a small amount of paint to the brush without using any water. Lightly brush the green over the brown spray paint using cross strokes.\n\n, You want to make sure it is completely dry before you move on. Make sure it is dry to the touch, especially along the edges where it may have gathered excess paint.\n\n, The tape should not remove any of the paint underneath it. If it does, you can touch these areas up with a brown marker.\n\n, You can use a pencil or screwdriver to help you get the ribbon through the hole. You will want to push it from the inside to the outside of the pan so that the majority of the ribbon is hanging on the inside to create your shoulder strap.\n\n, Make sure the knot is big enough that it will not slip through the hole. If it is too small, tie it a second time to make the knot bigger.\n\n, You should now have two ribbons hanging from the top of the shell on the inside of the pan.\n\n, Push the ends of the ribbons into the holes in the bottom of the shell to make two shoulder straps. You will want to push them from the inside out again. Don\u2019t tie knots yet.\n\n\nIn order to get the straps the correct length, it is best to have a friend hold the shell in place on your back before you tie knots in the bottom of the ribbons.\nPull the ribbons tight until the shell feels secure on your back, then tie knots in both ribbons to complete the shoulder straps.\n\n, This should be an appropriate size to fit on your back. If the cardboard seems flimsy, you could cut a second oval out of cardboard and glue the two together for reinforcement.\n\n, Place the cardboard oval on top of the dark green felt. Using a pencil, hold the tip as close as you can keep it to the edge of the cardboard as you trace around the oval onto the felt.\n\n\nIt is useful to keep one edge of the oval on the edge of the felt to make it easier to cut from the felt.\nMake sure you are saving enough felt to create a second, larger oval.\n\n, Using fabric scissors, carefully cut the oval from the fabric staying on the pencil line as much as possible.\n\n, Place the cardboard oval on the remainder of the dark green felt.\n\n\nMeasure three inches from the edge of the cardboard oval and move around the cardboard drawing dots on the felt three inches from the edge of the cardboard all the way around the oval.\nConnect the dots with a pencil to draw an oval three inches larger than the original oval\nUsing fabric scissors, carefully cut this oval out of the dark green felt.\n\n, Machine baste this oval using as long a stitch as possible.\n\n, Pull one of the threads on the large oval to draw the edges in toward the center of the oval. Tie a knot in both threads to hold them in place.\n\n, Don\u2019t skimp on the stuffing. Use as much as you can possible get into the oval.\n\n, Place your cardboard base on top of the stuffed oval. Wrap the edges of the felt over the cardboard and attach it to the cardboard using hot glue.\n\n, Think of these straps as those on a backpack to help you place them.\n\n\nPlace the slits in the bottom of the oval about one inch closer together than the slits on the top in order to create a cinching effect near the waist to keep the shell more secure on your back.\nPinch the felt between your thumb and forefinger where you are going to create the slit in order to cut within the fabric as opposed to starting from the edge.\n\n, Push the edge of the ribbon through the slits in the top of the small oval. The smaller bit of the ribbon will be on the underside of the felt oval. The length will create the straps. Push the other end of the ribbons through the slits in the bottom of the oval.\n\n, Attach the top of the straps first, then glue the oval over the gathered edges of your shell to create a back to your shell.\n\n\nPlace the oval over the cardboard to completely cover the back of your shell.\nGlue the small part of the ribbon to the cardboard to create the top of the straps.\nAttach the small felt oval to the cardboard using hot glue around the edges. Start at the top and working your way down. Stop before you reach the bottom of the oval.\nAttach the bottom of the straps to the cardboard before gluing the rest of the oval onto the cardboard. It is helpful to place the shell on your back at this point to get the appropriate length for your straps before gluing them.\nFinish gluing the rest of the oval over the cardboard base.\n\n, You will need several shapes to cover the shell. Use hexagons,squares and a four-sided shape with one rounded side, resembling an ice-cream cone shape.\n\n\nCut 5 hexagons out of the lighter green felt. The top and bottom lines should be longer than the other lines creating the triangular points on the sides. Cut two of these hexagons in half.\nMake enough small squares to cover the entire edge of the shell, leaving space between each tile to let the dark green felt show through the space between the squares.\nCut 6 of the four-sided shapes which will cover the top and the bottom of the shell. These shapes will create the scales filling the top and the bottom of the shell between the hexagonal scales. They should have one short side for the bottom, then two sides splaying out at a diagonal and a rounded top.\n\n, Start by placing one in the very center of the shell with the long sides running on the top and bottom of the hexagon so the shape is placed longways.\n\n\nLeaving enough space to allow the dark green felt to make lines between the scales, glue one hexagon above the center one, and the other hexagon below the center one.\n\n, The points of the half hexagons should fit between the points of the top and center, and bottom and center whole hexagons.\n\n, The points will face toward the center of the shell with the cut end facing the edge of the shell. Leave enough space between the scales to allow the dark green felt to create lines between the scales.\n\n, It may be helpful to design these shapes once the others are in place to make sure that they fit appropriately to cover the top and bottom edges of the shell while leaving space between the shapes to allow the dark green bottom layer to create lines between the scales. Glue these 6 shapes in place.\n\n, Glue the squares all the way around the edges of the shell to complete the scales. Leave enough space between the square to allow the dark green felt to show through and create lines all the way around the squares.\n\n\nIt is helpful to place the squares all the way around the shell before gluing them to make sure that you have enough space to fit them all completely within the edges.\nIf you don\u2019t have enough space when you complete your circle, you may need to cut one of the squares to fit the space available. Finish at the bottom of the shell.\n\n, Cover yourself in green from head to toe with green shoes, socks, pants and shirt.\n\n\nA green hoodie is a good option to cover your head in green. You can also try skull cap hat.\nYou may opt for green tights and a brown leotard to match your shell.\n\n, Don\u2019t forget your face when it comes to your costume. You can use as much or as little makeup as you choose.\n\n\nApply a full layer of green face paint to cover your face, neck and ears. Cover your skin in green a little past the collar of your shirt to make sure you\u2019re skin color won\u2019t show when your shirt shifts as you move. If you didn\u2019t find green mittens, you will also want to paint your hands.\nIf you choose not to completely cover your skin in green, you can opt to just do some green highlights like eyeshadow.\n\n, Put your arms through the straps and make sure it\u2019s snug. If the shell shifts around too much as you move, take it off and shorten the straps about an inch on each side.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":917}
{"text":" You will not see yourself represented well - unless enough people support, influence and help the right people into positions like city council, commissioners, district courts, legislators, elected judges -not just the executives (the mayor, county manager, district attorney or county judge's office, governor or even president)!\n\n, What changes will happen as a result of the reforms you vote for? Will these changes be for the better? Will there be some pain in the short run? Consider all of these carefully.\n\n, Sometime well before elections, contact the party or candidate that you support and volunteer to be a poll-watcher, if this is legal in your local election process.\n\n\nYou would receive instructions about the duties such as watching out for wrong deeds like electioneering (standing between incoming voters and the polling booths with propaganda of any kind). You would not interfere but only observe and report to designated authorities.\nYou should receive some identification for that candidate or party and the information about who you would call or contact, if you believe there are irregularities or lawbreaking in the polling place.;\n, These meetings take place for the purpose of deciding what will be on the agenda in the coming year, etc. They are often set up to be held at the end of the party primary-day so be at the polling place just before the poll closes to be admitted at each community voting place. (Some states use \"town hall or caucus\"--small convention style meetings--instead of individually balloting, so find out what time to be there to participate.)\n\n\nAt the primary precinct meeting your polling place officers are elected, as well as delegates to the county meeting (at the county meeting they elect county party officials and also state convention delegates, etc.) and your issues (initiatives) are sent to the next level to be agreed upon or dropped.\n\n, In many locales, the voters can wait or come back on the actual election day to the polling place just before the poll closes on that election evening and go to the meeting to watch the vote count, talk, and learn about the procedures and opportunities to get involved now or for next time.\n\n,,,, Plan for using a website; perhaps your county or state political party has a website on which you can get a webpage for your use.\n\n,, With individual work and effort, you reflect your values in local politics.\n\n, There will be another election soon, and you can try again.\n\n, Following a person is not going to change the core of your existence, but if you begin to suspect this is happening with someone you supported, admit you backed the wrong horse and withdraw your support immediately. The wrong person in an elected position can do great harm.\n\n, Then when elected don't just say: \"Oh it is worse than I knew, and we can not do those things right away. We'll do what we can.\"\n\n, Setting the example you hope will become the ideal is all you can really do. Don't engage in behaviors that, if discovered, will undermine all the work you (and others committed to the same cause) have done.\n\n, That will never come from bad politicians; rather, it will come from you and the your ideals. When you're talking about your views and it has engaged another person, then that individual will change the area around him or her. This can change the moral and social climate of any locale.\n\n, You will need twenty valid signatures, so get forty to be on the safe side. All your signers must be registered to vote in your assembly district. If you are lucky, seven or less candidates are running and you are elected. If eight or more candidates filed a petition, then your name will appear on the ballot and voters will vote for you in the primary. Once you are elected, then that gives you an opportunity to be a delegate to the annual state convention. You will also have an opportunity to run for the executive board of the county party. You will become well known by the activists and they are the ones you need to launch a political career.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":918}
{"text":";\n,, Some horses are not always trained to do flying lead changes. To train the horse, start by doing figure eights; canter one circle, slow down in the center to a walk, then go the other direction at the canter. Doing this helps the horse figure out that it is to switch leads when given a certain signal.\n\n, For example, spiraling in at the trot, 5 meter circles, etc.\n\n, Ask it to change direction normally (at a walk or trot).\n\n, For the purpose of clarity in this explanation, the article will say the horse's stronger lead is its left.\n\n, About 5 to 6 strides before the pole in the center, bring your horse down to trot, then once it trots over the pole, bend it to the left, push its haunches in with your inside (right) leg, then ask for a canter on the left lead. This is a simple lead change.\n\n, You want your horse to be strong with simple lead changes in one or two trot steps, before you attempt a flying change.\n\n, Once your horse is strong with simple changes with one or two trot steps, you can move on to flying changes. Similar to when you do a simple change, in a flying lead change you want to ask your horse to switch its leads over the pole.\n\n,,,,,, Younger horses especially may have difficulty with this if they hollow their backs.\n\n, If the horse did not change its canter lead, return to the trot at either A or C and begin again on the next long diagonal.\n\n\nThe most common reason a flying change will fail is because the horse will misinterpret the aids as an invitation to increase the speed rather than an aid to keep the horse balanced into the hand.\n\n,\n\n\nOnce your horse is 99 percent correct with its flying changes over the pole, remove the pole.\nWhen the horse gets the change, continue to canter for a few seconds, then bring it down to a walk and give it its head (for praise).\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":919}

Next, line the bottom of two 8-inch (20-cm) round cake pans with parchment paper and lightly coat them with butter and flour.You can use nonstick cooking spray instead of the butter to grease the parchment paper if you prefer.;\n, Add \u00bd cup (113 g) of softened butter and 1 \u00bc cups (250 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the two together on medium until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.You can mix the cake batter in a stand mixer if you prefer.\nYou can mix the batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort.\n\n, Once the butter and sugar are creamed together, add 3 large eggs to the bowl, one at a time. Completely mix each egg in on medium speed before adding the next.If you prefer, you can use egg substitute in place of the eggs.\n\n, When the eggs are fully incorporated, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract. Blend it in on medium until it\u2019s fully incorporated., Add 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (8 g) of baking powder, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they are fully blended.If you prefer a lighter, more airy cake, you can substitute cake flour for the all-purpose flour.\n\n, After you\u2019ve combined the dry ingredients, mix them them into the butter mixture alternately with 1 cup (237 ml) of milk. Beat the mixture on medium-low after each addition until the batter is fully blended.2% or whole milk works best for the cake.\n\n, Once you\u2019ve finished mixing the cake batter, divide it equally between the two prepared pans. Use a rubber spatula to spread the batter evenly throughout the pans., After you\u2019ve poured the batter into the pans, place in the preheated oven. Allow the cakes to bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and firm on top.You can be sure that the cakes are finished baking by sticking a cake tester or a toothpick inside the center. It will emerge clean when the cakes are done.\n\n, When the cakes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place the pans on a wire cooling rack, and let the cakes cool inside for 10 minutes., After the cakes have cooled for several minutes in the pans, run a butter knife around the sides to loosen the cakes. Carefully turn them out onto the cooling rack, and let them cool completely, which should take approximately 30 minutes.It\u2019s important to cool the cake completely so the frosting doesn\u2019t melt off when you ice the cake.\nBe sure to remove the parchment paper liners if they stick to the bottom of the cakes.\n\n, To get the right consistency for the frosting, it\u2019s important to chill your tools. Place a large bowl and the beaters from your handheld electric mixer in the freezer and allow them to chill for about 15 minutes.If you\u2019re using a stand mixer, place the wire whisk attachment in the freezer with the bowl to chill.\nIf you\u2019re mixing the frosting by hand, place a wire whisk in the freezer to chill with the bowl.\n\n, Once the bowl is chilled, add 8 ounces (225 g) of softened cream cheese, 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract to it. Beat the ingredients together on medium until the mixture is smooth., When the cream cheese mixture is fully blended, gradually add 2 cups (473 ml) of heavy whipping cream to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until firm peaks form.Make sure that the cream is extremely cold when you add it to the butter mixture.\n\n, Once the frosting is completely mixed, divide it between three bowls. You\u2019ll leave one bowl white, add blue paste food coloring to a second, and tint the third bowl pink. The amount of frosting in each bowl will depend on whether you\u2019re using icing or candy to reveal the gender of the baby.If you are using icing to reveal the gender, tint 1 \u00bc cups (283 g) of frosting blue for a boy or pink for a girl. Tint \u00bc cup (57 g) in the other color, and leave the remaining frosting white.\nIf you are using candy to reveal the gender, tint \u00bc cup (57 g) blue, \u00bc cup (57 g) pink, and leave the rest of the frosting white.\n\n, Set one of the cakes on a serving plate, and pipe all along the edge with white frosting. Next, spread 1 cup (226 g) of frosting in blue for a boy or pink for girl inside the circle.If you don\u2019t have a piping bag, you can simply spread some of the white frosting around the edge of the cake with a knife or offset spatula. Using the white border is just to ensure that the colored frosting won\u2019t be visible outside the cake.\n\n, After you\u2019ve covered the top of the first cake with the gender-appropriate frosting and a white border, place the second cake on top. Spread the remaining white frosting all along the top and sides of the cake., Once the cake is fully covered with white frosting, decorate it with the remaining blue and pink frosting. Pipe the colored frosting in dots, flowers, or stars around the cake in whatever design you like.A #8 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding pearl shapes around the cake.\nA #12 tip on your piping bag is ideal for adding dots to the cake.\nA #4 tip on your piping bag is ideal for writing a message on the cake, such as \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2026\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it.\n\n, Place one of the finished cakes on a serving plate. Use a large serrated knife to trim off the rounded top of the cake so it\u2019s flat and the second layer can rest evenly on top.To ensure that the frosting won\u2019t get on the serving plate, place several pieces of wax paper beneath the first layer all the way around the cake. If any frosting falls off the cake as you work, it will drop onto the paper, which you can pull away when you\u2019re done icing it so the plate remains clean..\n\n, After you\u2019ve flattened the first layer of the cake, use a large, round cookie cutter or a tupperware lid to serve as a stencil so you can cut a hole in the center with a knife. Remove the cake for the hole and set it aside.The round item that you use as a stencil should be at least 4-inches (10-cm) in size.\nThe cake that you remove from the center hole can serve as a tasty snack for yourself or friends and family.\n\n, Once you\u2019ve removed the cake from the center of the first layer, use some of your white frosting to ice the remaining edge all the way around. Next, use approximately 2 cups (406 g) of pink or blue chocolate candies in the gender-appropriate color to fill the hole.While you want to completely fill the hole with candies, don\u2019t allow them to overflow onto the edge of the cake.\n\n, When the center hole is filled with the candy, set the second cake layer on top of the first. Use the remaining white frosting to cover the top and sides completely., After you\u2019ve covered the entire cake with white frosting, use the pink and blue frosting to garnish the cake. Pipe it on in whatever shapes you like, such as flowers, dots, or stars.If you don\u2019t have a piping bag, you can put the frosting in plastic bags, snip off the corner, and pipe simple dots and swirls with it.\nYou can also use blue and pink chocolate candies to decorate the cake.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":920}

{"text":" This project is perfect for using up a bit of leftover acrylic in a bright color. Also choose a suitable hook.\n, Chain about two and a half to three inches' worth of stitches (7-7.5cm) for whatever yarn and hook you are using, perhaps 20-25 stitches. The length is more important than the number of stitches. The objective is to end up with a tube about an inch in diameter, or maybe a little bit more.\n\n, Do avoid twisting the chain.\n\n, That is, if the loop was about 1 inch (2.5cm) around, you should make it about 1 inch (2.5cm) tall. You're aiming for a rough proportion here, not any specific number of rows. It's all right to join rows, so that this part is a spiral.\n\n, However, do not crochet a turning chain. Each consecutive row will therefore decrease. If you know how to do a single crochet decrease, you can decrease even more. Tie off the colorful yarn, but leave the tails for now. Here again, the exact proportions are not critical.\n\n, Pinch the face together as you go to see how it will look., They'll take a little bit of extra time, but they have a bit more style and a better shape than anything you'll buy in the store. Leave the tails attached on the side of the eyeball and neatly tie off and trim the tails extending from the back.\n\n, Use a large tapestry needle. You will want the face open at this stage so that you can reach inside to stitch the eyes to the inside of the fabric and tie a knot, but you can pinch it closed with your fingers to see where the eyes should go.\n\n\nThe eyes go very close to the top of the face. They are basically symmetrical, but this is a goofy looking alien, so it's all right if they're a little lopsided.\nTie the loose ends tightly. You can even tie them to one another. Then trim them close so they don't show through the mouth.\n\n, Make sure all the tails inside are covered up, and tie in and trim any remaining loose ends of the tail.\n\n, You may wish to cut one or two pieces first to get the length right. Four feet (1.2m) is a good length to start with., On the end opposite the face, which is to say the bottom end, put a hook through any loop from the starting chain. Fold one of the cut lengths of yarn in half and grab the middle with your hook. Pull it through.\n\n, This creates a Larks Head knot, as shown in the first four photos under Steps in this article. You should now have two long tails with loose ends.\n\n, Leave your hook in this loop.\n\n, Make them fairly tight stitches; you want them to curl and you won't be crocheting into them. You may even want to use a hook that is a size or two smaller than the one you used for the rest of the body.\n\n,, This is one tentacle. Chain a tentacle from the second loose end. Continue adding tentacles all the way around the base of the body. You can also chain the bottom tail from making the initial tube, rather than tying it in.

{"text":" If a horse steps on a steel-toed boot, the metal in the front could slice into your toes. To protect your feet from a horse possibly stepping on you, choose boots made of firm leather. Soft leather boots, or tennis shoes, won't protect your feet at all. If you are riding, make sure your boots have a heel (usually about 2\" high). Don't wear lace up boots. The hooks will get stuck in the stirrups.\n\n\nWeight varies widely depending on your horse's size and breed, but typically falls between 880 to 1,870 pounds (400 to 850 kg).Having a quarter of that on your toes is still rather heavy, so take care when choosing safe boots.;\n, Choose a riding helmet with a retaining harness, and evidence that it's met safety requirements made no more than ten years ago.Look for labels from the SEI (Safety Equipment Institute), American Society for Testing & Materials (ASTM), or Kitemark.\n\n\nSome SEI-approved helmets include large ventilation holes that would not pass other tests, due to a possible increase in harm from penetrating injuries.\nReplace the helmet at least once every five years, and whenever it receives a major impact or shows signs of wear.\n\n, Avoid baggy clothing, which can get tangled in the horse's equipment. Most importantly, make sure you are easily visible before riding near roads. Fluorescent vests are recommended, especially during heavy rain, fog, or low light conditions.\n\n\nIf you are a beginning rider, learning to jump, or entering competitions, wear a body protector. The protector should fit comfortably, be less than five years old, and be approved by a safety standard organization.\nComfortable gloves and seam-free underwear and legwear can prevent sores and discomfort.\n\n, Anything dangling or removable can startle the horse or catch on his equipment. Take the following precautions:\n\n\nUse Peacock Iron Safety Stirrups. The safety stirrups will prevent you from hurting your feet and getting dragged. The stirrups include a break away band. Make sure you have extra bands as they break easily.\nRemove all jewelry. Even tight rings and bracelets can get snagged.\nTie back loose hair.\nHave non slip stirrup pads, a non slip girth, and a non slip saddle pad. The non slip girth and non slip saddle pad will keep your saddle from slipping. The non slip stirrup pads are designed to keep your feet from slipping while you're riding.\nWear a jumping vest. The jumping vest will protect your ribs and organs if you fall.\nSafety Cross Ties and a Breakaway Halter are a must. It's just as important for your horse to be safe as it is for you to be safe. You can use baling twine to attach your Safety Cross Ties to your barn. The baling twine will last longer than chains.\nAlways ride on a lunge line with a riding buddy to hold the lunge line. The lunge line will allow you to have extra control. This way if something goes wrong you'll be able to get off right away.\nNever ride alone. Riding alone will put you and your horse at risk for getting killed.\nDon't ride at night. It's harder for you to see in the dark.\nNo riding in the road. You or your horse could get hit by a car.\nCheck the weather before you ride. You don't want to get caught in a storm. It's too risky to ride if it's too hot or too cold.\nGo to the bathroom before you ride.\n\n, Check that all tack is the correct size and shape for the horse. Check all tack for wear and tear. This includes any cracking of stretching of the leather and the quality of the stitching. Anything that is close to breaking or snapping is a safety risk. Check before you mount, then again after riding a short distance.\n\n\nThe cinch should be tight enough to prevent the horse catching its leg, but not uncomfortably tight. Check again after mounting, after a few minutes of riding, and every few hours afterward during a long ride.You should be able to hold the reins without draping them over the horse's neck, or wrapping them around your hand.\nKeep all tack clean.\nMake sure that you have your stirrups set at the right length. When riding, you should be able to let your weight fall onto your heel.\n\n, During a jump or sudden movement, a neck strap is easier to hold onto than the horse's mane, particularly if the mane is braided. While neck straps are most often used for beginning riders, there is no harm in an additional piece of safety equipment. Nowadays, they are even used by some professionals., Keep at least one of each in your stables, and an extra one in the trailer if your horse is often on the road. Add a sturdy piece of paper with the contact information for a nearby veterinarian, human hospital, and (if possible) horse ambulance.Make sure someone in the area is trained in basic human first aid and equine first aid.\n\n, Check that all gates are closed before you let a horse into a field. Never let your horse loose near dangerous areas, such as roads or areas of treacherous ground.\n\n, Many horses learn how to undo simple latches and sliding bolts. Consider an eye bolt and\/or a commercial \"horse proof\" latch. For very bored or intelligent horses, add additional latches and\/or a wooden shelf to block the horse's access to the latch.If your horse is constantly trying to escape, she may need more companionship, exercise, or time spent outdoors.\n\n, Beginners should not be around horses without close supervision. As you grow in confidence and skill, you can handle a horse by yourself, but there should still be people close enough to hear or see if something goes wrong.\n\n, Horses have blind spots directly in front and directly behind. Approach from the side so the horse knows you're coming.\n\n\nEven in a small stall, try to get the horse to turn around. If the horse is tied up, approach from an angle, not directly behind.Speak to the horse calmly as you approach, to get the horse's attention.\n\n, Your hands are your primary communication tools with your horse. When grooming or tacking up, rest your hand on the horse's shoulder or hindquarters. This tells the horse you are there even if he cannot see you. It also gives you the best opportunity to push yourself away should the horse choose to kick. As you groom or tack up the horse, stand next to the horse's side with one hand on the horse whenever possible.\n\n\nPay attention to a sudden increase in tension. This may lead to a kick or lunge.\n\n, Tie the rope at the height of the horse's withers (the base of his neck), and make it no longer than your arm.Use a quick release knot so the knot can easily be undone. Never put your finger in the knot as you tie, since the horse could pull it closed.\n\n\nIdeally, you should tie the horse to a \"panic snap,\" not directly to a tie ring.The panic snap is a length of twine or string that the horse can easily break with a strong pull. Without a panic strap, the horse may fall if it gets startled, potentially injuring itself or you.\nNever tie the horse using its bridle reins.\n\n, Moving behind a horse makes you vulnerable to a powerful kick. If there is no room to walk outside its kicking range, walk right next to the horse, with one hand on the rump, and keep talking so the horse knows where you are. At this short distance, a kick will have much less force., Moving or standing in front of the horse is safer, but there are still risks. Never duck under the horse's belly (barrel), neck, or tie rope. This is almost guaranteed to spook him as your movement is quick, low and out of his sight. Both actions leave you wide open to being kicked and trampled on. From the front, he is also liable to rear and kick down on you.\n\n, Don\u2019t grab the halter itself, or you could be pulled off your feet when the horse startles. Never coil the rope around your hand or other body part, or let it drag on the ground where it could catch your feet. If this happens, the horse could pull the rope tight and cause major injury.\n\n\nFold the rope back over itself instead to reduce its length. Hold the rope by the middle of the folds, so you can easily drop it.\nNever loop extra lead rope around your hand\u2013\u2013your hand can be broken or even taken off if the horse spooks and tries to bolt, or you could be dragged behind the horse.\nDon't get into a pulling contest with a horse. The horse is much stronger than you and could easily pull you off your feet.\n\n, If the horse is very excited, put the food in a bucket instead. It may not be a good idea to feed the horse by hand regularly, as it may encourage nipping., If you need to examine the horse's hoof or leg, let the horse see what\u2019s happening and adjust to it. Put your hand on horse\u2019s shoulder or hindquarter, then move it slowly toward the leg. Squeeze the fetlock gently to get the horse to lift its foot, saying \u201cup\u201d at same time to teach this command.While holding horse\u2019s leg or foot, do not kneel or sit. Squat instead so you can easily jump away.\n\n, Pay attention to other horses nearby, not just the one you\u2019re handling. Don't walk behind other horses, or stand too near their feet.\n\n\nIn particular, avoid carrying food to the middle of a group of horses. They may crowd around and trap you in their excitement., Training a horse to enter a trailer for the first time can take weeks of patient communication, convincing the horse enter on its own first. Even when handling an experienced horse, make sure to tie or untie the horse with the trailer door closed. This prevents the horse from trying to exit before you are finished.\n\n, Beginning riders should always ride with a more experienced rider, although they do not need to share a horse. Riding in company is also a good idea if you are practicing jumps.\n\n, If a horse is acting wild or full of energy, have an experienced rider lunge (longe) the horse first.\n\n, Speak and behave calmly in the presence of horses. Horses work best with patient, quiet people. Never shout around the horse, as he may spook at the noise.\n\n, Check your surroundings constantly for possible sources of fear. This may include running children, an approaching car, or even a plastic bag blowing in the wind. If the horse's eyes widen and its ears point straight up, it may be scared. If this happens, calmly talk to the horse and try to move somewhere the horse can calm down.\n\n\n\nDesensitize the horse in a familiar setting if it is easily scared.\n\n, Horses are not always friendly when they meet for the first time. Touching their noses together can cause them to bite or strike.\n\n, Let the horse pick the pace when traveling over slippery ground, including ice, snow, and mud. When riding up or down a steep hill, keep the horse to a walking pace, even if it wants to go faster.Sticking to a walk is also a good idea at night or during low-visibility weather.\n\n, When near other riders, either ride abreast or stay far enough apart to avoid kicks. When looking between your horse's ears, you should be able to see the hind hooves of the horse in front of you.That said, when riding with a group, don't allow a horse to lag so far behind it has to gallop to catch up.A red ribbon on the tail is a sign of a kicker in some areas. Stay well back from these horses.\nWhen at the front of a group, shout back to inform other riders of possible dangers. These include broken glass, poor footing, and branches at head height.\n\n, Losing control of your horse can be a dangerous occurrence, especially if you don't know what to do. In most cases, the safest course of action is to stay on the horse and let it run until it calms down or tires out.Pulling back on the reins can limit the horse's vision and cause it to lose its footing.\n\n\nIf you practice with the horse beforehand, you can train it to step to one side, slowing it down. Without this training, pulling back on one rein may just limit the horse's vision and balance, or cause it to turn without slowing down.Do not jump off the horse unless it is headed to a road, cliff, or branches too low for you to safely pass under.\n\n, Since both you and the horse are a little more tired after a ride, it's helpful to follow a post-ride checklist to make sure everything gets done. Try this one:\n\n\nSlow to a walk before approaching the stable.\nAfter dismounting, tie the horse with a quick release knot.\nGive the horse a wash and groom.\nLead the horse back to the pasture or stall. Teach him early on to not rush off, but to stand calmly beside you with the halter on.\nRemove the halter. Pat and praise the horse for calm behavior. He should be able to remain standing by your side until you turn to leave.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":924}

{"text":" The better the grapes, the better the jelly. It doesn't matter if they are seeded or seedless, green, white or red. That said, seeded grapes usually have a stronger flavor, and the majority of jellies are made with red or Concord grapes.You can also use 5 cups of grape juice in a pinch.\n\n, You should have roughly five lbs of grapes to work with.\n\n\nIf you plan on canning all the jelly yourself, start preparing the cans now.\n\n\n, If you need a little extra to make sure that you have the berries covered, use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Raise the heat and put the cover on, letting the berries boil for ten minutes. Every few minutes give everything a nice big stir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Put about 2 cups at a time into the bag and let the juice drain. The jelly bag will collect the pulp, skin, and any seeds while the juice that you will use for the jelly drains out. You should have about 5 cups of juice at the end of this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSqueeze the juice through the bag with clean hands or by pressing it gently with a spoon. Empty and discard the pulp periodically if the juice is draining too slowly. Rinse the bag if needed.\nIf you don't have a jelly bag, try forcing it through a mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth., Get a vigorous, rolling boiling going for about a minute before moving on to the next step..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Keep the boil going for a quick, hard minute, stirring constantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Move quickly here -- you want the jelly to chill in the jars, not in the pot. Get the foam off with a slotted spoon and move on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a little different flavor, consider adding 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice here, giving your final jelly a bit of tangy-ness., This is why preparing the jars ahead of time is so essential. By letting the mixture cool out in the open, you open the possibility that the jelly will crystallize and turn to a chunky, unappetizing mixture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave roughly 1\/4 of an inch between the top of the jar and your fill line., Canning requires you to heat the jars (after the are filled with jelly) to sterilize them and preserve the fruit. You should have your hot water bath boiling at the same time as you jelly.The following method will help you if you do not have dedicated canning equipment. However, getting a canning set is almost always easier than using a homemade water bath.;\n, This allows you to work efficiently, as opposed to rushing around as the jelly finishes. If you don't have a dishwasher with a sterilize setting, wash them with soap and water. Then boil the jars for 10 minutes, leaving them in the water until you're ready to use them. The lids should be kept in hot (but not boiling) water for 5-10 minutes.\n\n\nThe jars need to be hot when you pour in the jelly, otherwise they may crack.\n\n, Canning jars have a lid and a ring. The lid needs to have an unbroken rubber seal along the outside edge, and these can only be used once for canning. The rims screw on top of the lid to close the jar completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, If you live above 1,000 feet above sea level, let them cook for the full ten minutes. Try to keep at least two inches of water above the top of the cans to speed up the process. Also, make sure that you have a tool capable of safely remove the hot cans from the boiling water before you begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live above 6,000ft above sea level, you should let the jars boil for closer to 15 minutes., Place the jars in a cool place (not the refrigerator -- that's too cold) and let them cool back to room temperature. After 1-2 hours, when they don't burn you when touched, loosen the rims on the jars a half turn or so to prevent it from rusting or sticking onto the jar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, It shouldn't easily pop up and down, and shouldn't make a noise when pushed. If it does then you don't have the jar completely sealed, and the preserves will quickly spoil if you're not careful. Properly preserved jelly should last up to 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":929}

This goes for competing sports teams, universities, or cousin rivalries.\n\n\nSay, \u201cWe can agree to disagree and leave it at that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d really rather not get into that here and I\u2019d prefer to have a great family gathering without this argument again.\u201d\n\n, If your grandfather says something offensive, ask yourself whether your comment will alter his perception or if it will spark a debate.\n\n\nSometimes you have to grit your teeth and say, \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion.\u201d\n\n, If you can\u2019t stand your relative due to a conflict, see if you can resolve the conflict between you and your relative. You may need to find time to sit down, be honest with each other, and clear the air. When approaching your relative, be kind, compassionate, and non-defensive.The sooner you resolve conflicts, the less resentment will build up.\nBe willing to forgive.You don\u2019t have to ignore the situation or pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but learn to forgive so that you can release the hurt in pain from within yourself.\n\n,), don\u2019t be afraid to say no. Remember that you have the right to say \u201cno\u201d. If you want to consider things before you immediately say \u201cyes\u201d, you also have the right to wait and think things over before you agree to anything.\n\n\nYou don\u2019t have to justify your response or give an excuse. Just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m unable to do that.\u201d You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation.\n\n, Perhaps your difficulties arise because of certain passive aggressive remarks from your relative comparing you to other grandchildren or nieces and nephews (\u201cWell, Jason got into the university but you did great going to community college\u201d). You may even feel manipulated by your relative by passive aggressive remarks or actions. If your relative is passive aggressive toward you, keep your distance as much as possible and don\u2019t interact more than you have to; remember that it\u2019s not about you and it\u2019s not personal.If you feel like you are being manipulated, find an exit strategy from the conversation (\u201cI\u2019m going to see if any help is needed in the kitchen\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to go play with my nephews, I haven\u2019t seen them for so long!\u201d). Don\u2019t engage the conversation.\n\n, If you struggle to enforce family boundaries with relatives, firmly let them know that family rules apply at all times. If you don\u2019t like how a relative treats your child (like bossing the child around or feeding foods that are unhealthy), let this relative know that the behavior goes against family rules, and family rules are enforced in and outside the home.\n\n\nBe upfront and matter-of-fact when discussing this with your relative. Say, \u201cAllison isn\u2019t allowed to play that game at home, and she\u2019s not allowed to play it here, either.\u201d\n\n, If a relative has done something unforgivable, enforce whatever boundaries allow you to feel safe. If that means not inviting this relative to family functions, fully avoiding him or her, or letting the family know that relationship is severed is up to you. Put the focus on feeling safe, and not on punishing the family member.\n\n\nUse your best judgment in telling other family members the situation. Keep in mind that while you feel the situation is unforgivable, your family may not feel the same way and continue a relationship with this family member.\nWhile you may want your distance from your family member for your safety, realize that estrangement can be really hurtful, both to you and your family members., If you know you\u2019ll be spending the day with a relative you dislike, make sure you come into the situation as prepared as possible. If this person brings out an aggressive or testy side of you, make sure you get a good night\u2019s sleep the night before. If you\u2019re feeling tired and grumpy at the family Christmas party, leave early. And make sure you\u2019ve eaten, too: if your blood sugar is stable, you\u2019re less likely to become angry or aggressive., If someone belittles you, talks down to you, or says mean things to you, it\u2019s important to remember that this is more a reflection of the person than it is of you.Stand firm and remember who you are. Do your best to tune out the words, and remind yourself, \u201cThis is not about me. This is my aunt\u2019s projection.\u201d\n\n\nPeople are often mean because they have their own personal issues they are dealing with. This can happen when people have low self esteem, anger issues, or stress.\nOther people might act a certain way and truly believe it is okay and normal. This can be caused by a number of factors, but one example might be a person who lets their competitive and cutthroat business style seep into their personal life.\nSome individuals simply don't have the biological tools needed to feel empathy. This may be brought about by genetic differences or by the way someone was brought up (i.e., the environment they grew up in)., There\u2019s likely nothing you can do to change the person whom you don\u2019t get along. You may have a fantasy of a happy family celebrating every holiday together, and when this relative comes, it crushes that fantasy. It\u2019s up to you to drop this fantasy and accept that this is the family you have, and that fantasy is nothing more than a happy and nice thought that\u2019s not based in reality., Instead of approaching this relative in judgment and disgust, practice being accepting and empathic. Listen when your relative talks and try to understand this person\u2019s point of view.Practice loving compassion for this person. Take a deep breath and look at your relative. Then think, \u201cI see you, and I see that you suffer and are in pain. I don\u2019t understand your pain, but I see that it is there and I accept that it affects me for the time being.\u201d, Maybe you\u2019re excited to see your nieces and nephews, or happy you get to cook (or not cook).\n\n\nFind things to be grateful for even before you arrive to the family function. That way you can go into the situation already feeling thankful.\n\n, If you have a hard time moving past the hurt and pain the relative has caused, you may benefit from therapy. A therapist can help you work through feelings, find coping mechanisms, see things from a different perspective, and help you work through underlying feelings of depression, anxiety, or other diagnoses.You may also consider family therapy if you wish to engage your relative in therapy with you. While it may be difficult, it can help you confront difficult topics and discuss them with your relative.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":930}

{"text":" You will want to wear clothes that will not restrict your movements or blood flow. Don\u2019t wear clothes which are too tight, especially around your joints. You will also want to wear clothing which is made of a material which breathes well, since you will sweat when doing many forms of exercise. Clothes specifically designed for exercise can easily be found.;\n, Just because we call them tennis shoes does not mean they are great athletic shoes. Shoes like Converse have little shock absorbency and can be terrible for your feet and bones. Get shoes which fit comfortably and are designed for the type of activity that you intend to do.\n\n, Drink lots of water before you exercise. Your body will need the water to help your muscles work and also to help you sweat. If you\u2019re dehydrated before you start, just think about how you\u2019ll feel afterwards!\n\n, Don\u2019t stretch before exercising. Contrary to popular belief, studies have shown that this is not helpful and will not allow you to perform any better. If anything, stretching before exercising will make you worse off: it\u2019s a great way to pull or strain a muscle and hurt yourself!\n\n, Though researchers cannot agree definitively on whether or not warm ups help you to perform better in exercises, they all agree that warming up certainly won\u2019t hurt.Warm up before exercising by doing a less intense version of your intended workout for 5-10 minutes. If you plan to run, jog first. If you intend to swim, swim slowly.\n\n, Certain conditions may make it a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise regimen. There are exercises for every health condition, but it\u2019s a good idea to know what to avoid. Exercising should make you feel healthy and good in your own body: not hurt you!\n\n\nIf you have diseases or conditions like asthma or lung problems, arthritis, diabetes or liver and kidney problems, or heart disease, definitely talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.If you notice certain problems, you will also want to talk to a doctor. These include things like pain or dizziness following physical exertion, shortness of breath after very mild exertion or when at rest, or swelling in the ankles.\nYou may also want to talk to a doctor simply to find out what kind of exercise they recommend for your particular goals and health conditions. You can also consult with a nutritionist and a trainer for more information on exercising and how you can best meet your goals.\n\n, Aerobic exercise is often called a \u201ccardio\u201d workout, since it is designed to increase and improve blood flow. These types of exercises are of a lower intensity but last for longer periods of time.\n\n, Climbing stairs is a great way to get your heart rate up. You can climb actual stairs or you can use a stair machine at a gym. Climbing stairs improves your leg muscles as well as your butt. Be careful if using actual stairs, however, as you do not want to fall and get seriously injured.\u00a0\n\n, This is not just a fun game for children but also an excellent workout. Working the arms, legs and core muscles, this is an exercise that you can easily do at home. It is also well known for improving balance and is excellent for people who intend to play sports.\n\n, Jumping jacks are an exercise performed by standing with the legs together, arms at your side, and then jumping to move the legs outward and raising the arm together above your head. Jump again to return to the starting position. These are great for getting your heart rate up and burning calories.\n\n, Walking and jogging are wonderful ways to get your heart rate up. Though jogging may be difficult on the knees for some people, walking is certainly an accessible exercise and should be done by those at every level. Studies have shown that walking an hour a day can help you maintain your weight over time and reduce your likelihood of certain conditions, like hypertension and obesity. , Swimming is great exercise and is fun to boot. This will work different muscles depending on the style of swimming you do. Swimming is frequently recommended for people with joint problems or those that are significantly overweight, as it can take a great deal of strain off of the skeleton while still raising the heart rate.\n\n, Riding your bike is an accessible, environmentally friendly, and very effective way to get exercise. Working muscles in most areas of the body, bike riding will get your heart rate up while it gets you somewhere! You can bike outside or you can get a stationary bike and stay at home.\n\n, Anaerobic exercises are those done at a higher intensity for shorter periods of time. These build strength and help your body to become accommodated to working hard. Paired with a healthy diet, these exercises can also help you to lose weight, as your body\u2019s caloric use will increase. These types of exercise are actually arguably better for burning fat than aerobic exercises. , Running is tough on the knees and bone structure but is still an excellent form of exercise. You can run locally around your neighborhood or around a track at a gym. Remember that running is different than jogging: it\u2019s much faster and much harder to do!\n\n, There are many different types of weights you can lift and ways to lift them, but doing this type of exercise will help you build a variety of muscles and increase your strength. Be sure to start small and work your way up, since trying to lift something which is too heavy is a common way to injure yourself.\n\n, Push ups are done by placing yourself with your stomach on the ground. Place your feet so that your toes are flat on the ground, then place your hands flat on the ground at face level, a shoulder\u2019s width apart. Then, keeping the line of your back and legs completely straight, lift your body with your arms by pushing against the ground so that your whole body is supported on your toes and hands. Lower yourself back down so that your nose is nearly touching the ground and then raise yourself back up. Repeat.\n\n, Squats are done by standing with your feet a shoulder\u2019s width apart, back straight, arms crossed in front of you, and slowly lowering yourself down as if to sit in a chair. Once in the sitting position, slowly raise yourself back up. These are a great exercise for your core and leg muscles.\n\n, Burpees (a common military exercise) are done starting in a standing position, then drop to a crouch, jump the legs back into push-up position, do one push-up (if you want), hop your legs back to the crouch position, and then jump straight upwards with hands raised to return to the standing position. This is a great workout as it exercises all areas of the body.\n\n, Core workouts develop the muscles around your abdomen. This has many benefits. With a stronger core, you will be less prone to back pain and injury and you will also be able to improve bad posture. Paired with weight loss, strong core muscles will also give you defined abs.\n\n, Planks are probably the most efficient core exercise. You can greatly improve your core strength with just a few minutes of this exercise every day. Planks are done by taking a position similar to a push up, but supporting the upper half of your body on your forearms and holding the position for as long as possible. It will surprise you how difficult it is if you\u2019ve never tried it but the exercise is extremely effective.\n\n, Crunches are another great core exercise, done by lying face up, knees bent, arms crossed at your chest, and lifting just the head and shoulder up towards the pelvis. Lower yourself back down and repeat.\n\n, Sit ups are similar to crunches and are done by lying face up, knees bent only slightly, and rolling your upper body into a sitting position. You can cross your arms in front of you or run your palms up and down your thighs as you move to guide your movement.\n\n, Bridges are a great core exercise because they also work on your bottom and lower back muscles. These are done by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your arms flat on the ground at your sides. Slowly roll your back and lift your hips until a straight line is created between your shoulders and knees, your back and thighs parallel, and then slowly lower it back into starting position.\n\n, T\u2019ai chi is a Chinese martial art, the forms of which are done in sequences of slow movements. Doing t\u2019ai chi will allow you to build better balance but it can also be very relaxing. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.\n\n, Weight shifts are a great starting balancing exercise. These are done by standing with both feet on the ground, hip width apart. Next, shift all of your weight onto one leg and lift the other slightly off of the floor. Hold the position, trying to maintain good form, for 30 seconds. Do the other leg. Repeat as much as you want. , These are done same as the above, with the exception that the lifted leg is bent backwards at the knee. This will work on your front-to-back balance, whereas the previous one focuses more on side-to-side. Both should be used in conjunction.\n\n, Pilates is a series of forms and movements which occasionally makes use of tools like exercise balls, weights, and resistance bands. This form of exercise helps train muscles with the correct movement patterns which can improve balance, core strength, posture and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.\n\n, Yoga is an Indian meditation technique and exercise which has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety (in turn aiding weight loss) and is excellent for building better balance and flexibility. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center. You can also find lessons online or DVDs which will allow you to practice at home.\n\n, Various forms of dance, such as ballet, are actually fairly rigorous exercise and can significantly improve your flexibility, as well as your coordination. Find a local group to practice with or take a class from a local gym or community center.\n\n, Stretches should be done after warming up or exercising, as this will help prevent muscle strain and injury. Stretching your muscles will help provide much greater flexibility and can reduce the likelihood of injury due to strain during other exercises later on.A basic stretch to try is a hamstring stretch. This is done by sitting, splaying your legs apart, and reaching forward to touch one foot at a time. You can bend the leg which is not being reached across.\nAnother basic stretch is a butterfly groin stretch. This is done by sitting on the floor and pulling both ankles in towards your crotch, getting as close as you can. Try to press your knees to the floor as you do this.\nTry a simple shoulder stretch. This is done by pulling your elbow across the front of your body towards the opposite shoulder. Press against your arm as you do this.\nThis wall stretch aids mobility in the chest, shoulders, abs, hip flexors, quads and calves. Face a wall standing about a foot away from it, then reach your hands up as high as you can flat against the wall, leaning forward into it with your chest and hips while keeping your feet in position flat on the floor.\n\n, You don\u2019t have to dedicate hours of your day to exercising. Anything helps, so find ways to fit exercise into the smaller \u201cin between\u201d moments of your day. You can do squats while you wait for food to cook or microwave or fit in a minute of planks when you first wake up. Look and you will find moments in your day to get a little more active.\n\n, If you spend most of your day sitting in a desk chair, you will find you have a lot to gain from finding an alternative. Using a standing desk or a standing desk in combination with a treadmill will get you burning calories while you work (it doesn\u2019t even have to be fast paced, though the harder it is the more you\u2019ll get out of it). If that\u2019s not for you, try an exercise ball instead of a desk chair. Some research has found that using these methods can help you lose over 40 lbs a year if you\u2019re overweight. , When getting to your apartment or office, skip the elevator and take the stairs instead. This is great because you can add a floor at a time as it becomes easier for you to get up the stairs. Eventually you can also run up the stairs for some added exercise.\n\n, Whenever you can, stop using your car if it is possible for you to get yourself where you\u2019re going on foot or on a bike. Turn grocery shopping into a workout by walking to the store a few times a week to pick up a smaller number of items. Take a bus to work and get off a few stops early to walk. Ride your bike to work if you can. If you have to take your car, park really far away from your building. This is a great way to introduce physical activity into your day. , This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.\n\n, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.\n\n, This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a few seconds, and then return.\n\n, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.\n\n, Sit in a chair, stand up and repeat. You can try doing these squats without the chair if you have the strength and balance to do so., This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.\n\n, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.\n\n, This will obviously need to be broken up. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for 30 seconds, and then return.\n\n, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets., This can be broken up into three 5 minute sets.\n\n, This can be broken up into two half-hour sets.\n\n, If you can, do these in one set. However, they can be broken up into 2-3 sets.\n\n, At this point you need to work in variations like the side plank and reverse plank as well. Simply keep the position for as long as you can, rest for a minute, and then return., You will want to choose weights and positions based on the muscle groups you wish to focus on. Break up the hour into three 20 minute sets and try to work different muscle groups in each set., This can be broken up into three 10 minute sets.\n\n, Interval training is any exercise done at a very high intensity for only a few brief minutes (2-3 at most) and alternated with either no activity or a slow paced activity. Interval training is widely regarded to be one of the most effective exercise regimens, since it is less time consuming but appears to produce identical effects., The most basic interval training routine would be to sprint for 2-3 blocks (or the equivalent of 400 meters) and then walk back to the starting point, beginning the process over again.\n\n\nAn alternative would be to combine this with an aerobic workout. Warm up by walking slowly for five minutes, quickly for ten minutes, sprint for three blocks, walk back two block, sprint for three blocks, walk back two blocks (and so on, lasting 15 minutes), and then walking back quickly to your origin point to cool down.\n\n, You can apply interval training to almost any exercise activity. Try cycling, swimming, many core exercises, and so on. Try to alternate between exercise activities on different days to ensure that all of your muscle groups get attention.\n\n, You will want to set your goal for exercising at least \u00bd an hour a day. Slowly, over time, you should draw this out to 1 hour. This time period, however, can be broken up into sections and spread over the course of the day, however, those sections should be no less than 10 minutes. When you begin, exercise at least 2 days a week. Over time you should increase your frequency up to 5 days a week., Walking is the best thing you can do for improving your health. As discussed above, a study found that a mixture of intense and relaxed walking in senior citizens decreased the likelihood of certain diseases by 20%. You can walk with your friends, family members, or by yourself. If you want to walk in the comfort of indoors, you can walk around the inside of your apartment building or you can walk the inner corridor of the local mall. You can also walk outside if you prefer.\n\n\nTry to walk for at least half an hour a day and go at a pace that gets your heart rate up. If you do not push your body at least a little, you will not gain nearly as much from the exercise.\n\n, As we age, we tend to lose a lot of our balance. This is normal. However, you will want to work on your balance to help ensure that you can move around without hurting yourself. Do balance exercises to protect yourself and prevent injury.A good, basic balance exercise is to try standing on one leg. Make sure to do both legs in turn and to also have a chair nearby to hold on to if necessary to prevent falling.\n\n, Muscles lose their elasticity over time, which can make it difficult for you to move around or get up if you fall. Do flexibility exercises like stretches to maintain your muscles and keep you safe and independent. , Lift small, 2lb weights (more if you can). This will help you maintain the strength in your hands and arms, allowing you greater independence for longer.\n\n, Cool down exercises, like warm up exercises, are a gentler exercise, meant to ease your body between working hard and being at rest. Cool down by walking for 5-10 minutes and (preferably) stretching. Stretching before exercising is likely to cause injury but stretching after exercise, when the muscles are warm and active, will help improve their tone and flexibility., When you exercise, your muscles use up and your body sweats out a number of essential nutrients. You need to replace these nutrients or you can hurt yourself or become sick. These nutrients, water, sodium, potassium, and sugar, can be consumed in a number of ways. You could try drinking water and eating a banana or drinking water and eating a protein bar, among a variety of other options. If you choose to drink a sports drink, it is best to dilute the drink at a ration of 6 to 1 (that is 6 parts water for each part drink) since these drink's sugar content is unnecessarily high.\n\n, Exercising, especially the kind that pushes your body beyond its comfort level (the good kind!), can cause muscle pain and discomfort. This is normal and a healthy sign of your body getting into shape and becoming stronger. You may want to manage the pain though. This can be done by taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen or using an ice pack.Intense pain with a fast onset is an indication that you have injured yourself. Consult with a doctor or nurse, especially if it is very severe or lasts for more than a few days.\nPrevent muscle pain to begin with by slowly easing into exercise, both in an individual routine but also over the course of time. Don\u2019t leap straight into a high intensity program but rather build yourself up to that level over the course of several months.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":932}

{"text":" You will need to be rested and your patience gauge must be full. Don't expect to do observing in the same night you start collimation if your telescope is way out of alignment, otherwise you'll rush things.;\n, Remember: a LITTLE hole. You can do it using a pointed scissor. Put it into the eyepiece.\n\n, You realize it needs collimation if you don't see the entire secondary mirror through the collimation cap and if you don't see the three locks over the primary mirror (the concave one, in the back of the scope).\n\n, So don't mess around with it unless you're certain of its misalignment! You may need to collimate the secondary if you bought the scope second hand or if you have already messed up with it.\n\n, Place a colored paper behind the secondary mirror, inside the tube of the telescope. For this step, you'll need to open your scope.\n\n, WARNING: keep your scope in a horizontal position, so the secondary mirror won't fall on the primary.\n\n, Now you need the center the reflection of the primary mirror in the secondary. Still using your homemade collimation cap, screw one of the three secondary screws, and start screwing the other two gradually until you see the three locks over the primary mirror. These locks are 120\u00b0 apart from themselves, so they're easy to spot.\n\n, It is a little easier then the secondary. Most new telescopes come with the exact center of the primary already marked, but if yours is not marked, you can do it by simply sticking a round piece of white paper in the exact center (take your time doing it: it must be the EXACT dead center). It won't trouble your observing as long as your piece of paper is smaller then the secondary mirror's diameter. I recommend using a piece of paper with half inch diameter (or 1 cm).\n\n, Use the screws under the primary to do that. In most telescopes there are six screws, grouped in pairs. In this pair, one them is a locking screw, and the other is the adjusting one. Take your time to learn how they move the mirror.\n\n, If your telescope has what we call a \"secondary offset\", the spider may be off center in the final results. But don't be bothered by that if the reflection of your eye is centered.\n\n, You may stop the collimation process here. But if you want to observe the planets in the Solar System and binary stars, you NEED to do a fine tuning in your collimation, in a process called \"star test\".\n\n, People in the Southern Hemisphere are not as fortunate, because finding a stationary star is way more difficult for them. But worry not: be smart! You can use any bright dot-sized light source to do the fine tuning, like antennae or far (really far) away street lights. This way you can do the fine tuning in cloudy nights and the light source is absolutely stationary. The results are the same.\n\n, Use your highest magnification lens. Focus it. Now continue gradually rotating the focusing knob until you see a pattern that resembles a target (it may be off center) or a Doppler-effect illustration. If your scope is way out of fine alignment, you won't see this effect. But any slight over-focus will do the trick.\n\n, Use the screws in the back of the primary mirror to do that. Be aware that your light source will MOVE A LOT and go out of view. Keep track of where it goes so you can find it again. This process may take a few hours of trial and error, but it is rewarding.\n\n, No need to buy a 50$ piece of plastic or an abhorrently expensive laser collimator (even this laser may need collimation!).\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":934}
{"text":" There are five basic types. All require periodic inspection and can need maintenance to fix any punctures, tears, cracks or cuts. They are all in rolls of 1 yard (91.44 cm), or in 1 meter width (39.4 inches) except for Single-ply Membrane which come folded:\n\n\nBuilt-up Roofing: This method, known simply as BUR, is done by overlapping rolls of treated felt using hot (molten) tar or asphalt. It becomes brittle and cracks up over the years.\nSingle-Ply Membrane Roofs: This type is excellent but requires propane torch heat to install the seams. The membrane may be injured, cut, etc. and with only the one layer that can be problematic.\nSprayed Polyurethane Foam: This kind of roofing material is sprayed, or squeegeed flowed onto the surface and may be protected by a special second coating.\nModified Bitumen (Asphalt) Roll Roofing: This is a method in which a single layer of asphalt-treated, granule coated felt is cold cement sealed or hot sealed to the primed decking or to a base sheet.\n\"SA\" Self-adhesive (SBS, APP or modified bitumen) rolls: These often include (1) both an SA base sheet and the SA cap sheet, both come in rolls -- or (2) only a single cap layer is applied to a primed decking. (The material has a split backing where after a length of it is rolled-out and aligned, then half the backing is pealed off and that half smoothed down; next the other half of backing is peeled and smoothed down as well.)\n\n, Different roof types require different materials. The amount of each material depends on the surface area of the roof.\n\n, Use a special scraper, square nose spade or shovel, or such to loosen the old roofing material., Check for and repair low areas because they will not drain well. The roof rafters are like joists; there is not much pitch, or incline, and they may warp and sag. Repair any sagging rafters and decking to prevent ponding\/standing water. Some roofs have drains, such as having walls around the roof and have drains to be keep cleared and intact.\n\n, Can't strips should have 2 45 degree cuts and be fitted into inside corners of the roof surface. The felt used in BUR cannot bend at right angles. The can't strips help ameliorate the problem.\n\n, It is made of paper, polyester OR fiberglass saturated with asphalt. It is set down with a 2 to 4 inch (5 to 10 cm) seam, or overlap, between sheets.\n\n\nFasten the sheets with special (large, thin-headed) roofing nails (in appropriate length for your process and thickness of deck or sheathing), spaced about 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart along the overlapped edges and staggered 12 inches (30.48 cm) apart elsewhere (\"in the field\"). The edge of roof nailing of roofing (if required) is staggered (to not split deck) close, 2 inch (~ 5 cm) spacing.\nCut the base sheet to fit around vents in the roof and lay it over the can't strips.\n\n, Flashes are material you apply around vents and other areas to prevent water damage. You can further protect the roof from water damage by applying plastic roofing cement at these sites.\n\n, There are several types of felt you can use to replace your roof. Most are either coal-tar or asphalt saturated paper or fiberglass fibers (all may be called fabric or felt). The felt material comes in rolls that are 36 inches (91.44 cm) or 1M (39.4 inches) wide.\n\n\nRead labels. Consider the type of roof and climate before choosing the felt and the asphalt, tar or other roof cement so that you select the correct types for your roofing process.;\n,, Asphalt works to seal the asphalt-saturated felt to make the roof waterproof.\n\n\nMop and lay another strip 12 inches (30.48 cm) wide, over the first such strip, forming a double thick, starter edge-seam.\nMop full width felt over that double thick 12 inch starter across the roof.\n\n,\n\n\nKeep the asphalt at optimum temperature as the roll is unrolled onto the mopped, hot, liquid asphalt little by little. It is important to immediately roll felt paper into it to ensure effectiveness, as that hot liquid is the adhesive, and becomes less liquid and finally solidifies as it cools.\n\n, You can repeat the entire process of laying the asphalt saturated felt and mopping each layer with hot asphalt 3, 4 or up to 5 layers over the entire roof.\n\n, To do this, give the roof a heavy final coating of hot asphalt and then cover the entire surface with crushed-granite aggregate. The covering protects the roof from the effects of the sun, and helps protect the roof from objects such as fallen limbs.\n\n\nAlternative covering: Sometimes the BUR roof is topped by spraying or rolling on a silver colored, metallic aluminum, asphaltic \"paint\".\nAnother alternative: White elastomeric (rubbery) plastic coating may be used to cover the BUR.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":935}

{"text":" Although few articles do exist of some theme parks, if you type in the theme park's name into the green search bar at the top of any wikiHow page, you can generally get to see if your given topic has already been written or not. If the search results come up with a list of articles, you'll need to compare your topic idea to the articles there to see if any of them meet the requirements for a duplicate title as the one you are proposing and to ensure your topic you began isn't deemed to be something that will one day need to be merged to prevent duplicate information in two different articles according to our Merge Policy.\n, Make sure to use the term \"Visit\" as part of the how-to title as written on this site at the very front of the title followed by the theme park name. If the theme park has more than one branch (such as Six Flags and similar), you'll need to add in it's name after the theme park name. If there are still several notable differences of multiple choices, you'll need to finish this title off with \"in\" and the city name in which this theme park itself is based., You'll need to know whether or not the park has several sections (or lands) throughout the park, the park has lands that are untitled but tend to be split into their own groups, or if the park is spread sporadically around a bunch of ungrouped lands focused around one or two soul footpaths with buildings on either side.\n\nIf the park has titled lands, you'll more likely to need to use the wikiHow Advanced Editor or Article Creation tool so you can establish the subsections of steps, so that each land can be portrayed accurately, and so that the reader doesn't lose their focus because it looked confusing to read to them. This will be described more in a few steps from here, so be prepared.\nIf the park has untitled lands, you'll more than likely need to designate some type of system to explain to the reader the direction of travel when the reader would be walking and how they'd come upon it. If the attraction is at the borderline between two untitled lands, you'll need to mention something along the lines of \"If you've reached (attraction name in second title), you've walked too far or reached into the next land\" upon the last attraction in the lands' section.\n\nIf you do not like (or do not understand) wiki-text languages, you can use the Article Creation Tool. However, using this will make the flow seem to go awful slow and you'll end up giving up a whole lot sooner.\n\n\nIf the park doesn't have titled lands or has no visible lands but a few soul footpaths, you can use the Guided Editor to begin your article, but you'll still have some work to do to establish a great article otherwise. Guided Editor will help form some of the wiki-text to form the items you talk about into Steps.\n\nFor most of these articles, you won't need to add substeps (of your main Steps) and many sub-tips of Tips which some users find difficult to understand the syntax of.\n\n\n\n, Although this will depend on how you want to get into the article and how your settings run, most users will want to click the \"Write an Article\" button from any page of wikiHow which will send you to this page where you'll have to input your proposed title. This is a double-check step to ensure none of the top five (5) articles match what the article calls for as a duplicate. Type your title based on our Title Policy and click \"Get Started\" then click the \"None of these are exactly the same as How to (title)\" and click \"Write My Article\"., The Article Creation tool, as was stated earlier can help, but you can also send the article to be written in the Advanced Editor from there, or you can deselect this option in the preferences page and write them from Guided Editor and switch between Advanced and Guided on the fly. For those who know front-end wiki syntax very well, you can (and should) use the Advanced editor and go from there, but each article's information will vary widely., The introduction of the article is the first place that will establish the first form of communication to get your reader psyched into visiting the park. However, it isn't there to spoil the user's vacation to the park or describe just what the article is bound to do. Shoot for three to four sentences for an introduction, as part of a paragraph to psych the reader to get them ready to read the remainder of the article., Although park maps will differ, park maps with all rides and attractions should be enough to formulate a good article that is ready to be researched. Experience in the particular park you are planning to write about is definitely a plus, but giving the reader the ability to see just how much there is to do in the park, makes for one excellent article - even if you feel that the ride was rather lame, let the others know that when they arrive at the step that they might want to either not ride or take things in stride or to skip the ride at all. (Even other shows and attractions should be written as their own step.), Anything that makes this attraction unique is a strong point to write down about the attraction and include in the Step inside the article. Either research the ride on Flickr (for static images) or YouTube (most widely-used researching choice for videos) to see just what each ride is like. With so many users on YouTube filming their on-ride POV videos (and even some with off-ride videos), you'll need to know just what the user should expect to encounter on their ride.\n\nEven if you've been to the park before, make sure you see spots where others might have recorded that show things others were thinking to see where your reader might not understand if given the article inside the park. Try to expand on others' mistakes from their filming and explain their wrongdoings.\n(Search using the exact ride name along with the theme park's name as well as a trigger word using \"on-ride\" or \"off-ride\" (or sometimes even the trigger abbreviation \"POV\") as these videos can take either of these two forms when searching. If the search returns no results (or few\/unrelated results), omit these trigger words altogether and try again. If this still produces none, you'll need to rely on other sources of information such as from this theme parks website which could list information about their rides.\n\nFor show attractions however, neither terms \"on-ride\/off-ride\" nor \"POV\" are ever used, so do your research without these triggers behind as your search term.\n\n\n\n, (i.e. Scrambler rides can be formed into Scramble, as well as shows being either Watch or Take in.). Try not to use the action verbs \"Go\" or \"Ride\" as they can be considered vague and the reader might not be in an understanding with those steps set that way or need to further question what to expect when they get there and will tend to venture away to find more information that you should have researched already. As you work through the park, focus on gathering an action verb to describe what the ride does, what types of scenery it provides and how the two elements interact to provide for a great ride experience and describe. Even if you have never ridden the ride or watched the attraction before, get to know exactly what all attractions are like., Make sure the reader understands some of the other theme park options of nearby theme parks that could be around or within a comfortable (30-90 minute) driving distance or in case they don't want to go to this park once they arrive), as well as noting the address of the park (which you'll need to cite where you reputably obtained the park address\/contact info from).\n\nGoogle has information, but you'll have to really deep-down delve to really understand where it's getting it's information. Bing has it set up so that once asked, the engine will give you your answers then relay you to the website it found the information from then send you to other possible search results if you still didn't find the information you were looking for.\n\n, But, please read on, as it's not all about those few steps to visit the park.\n\nDiscuss the parking situation. Although you don't need to grab directions from a nearby landmark like most websites mention (since everyone is coming from different places), you might want to discuss whether the park's parking options include an open lot or some sort of enclosed parking garage. If you can find the parking spot's exact address located online somewhere, provide an address as close as you can to the parking garage as well as it's price for a general 2-to-4 axle car. If you can't, provide it's nearest cross-streets nearest the entrance to the parking area.\n\nAlthough this should really be written by typing from a real-life perspective of what you'd find (as if you were the reader looking for these answers yourself), if you do enough research on your topic, this will take you a small amount of time - if you know just where to look for your answers.\nIf you have enough citable information as to the parking lot section names (few theme parks websites and apps list this information), provide these names and cite your source as to where you found these names. Don't just say that you found the list on (name major website here) and send the reader searching for answers or looking to prove your information to be inaccurate - no! - that doesn't tell the reader exactly where this information can be found and will more than likely send your reader looking elsewhere to gather the information they need on another website or competitors website (if one exists).\n\n\nExplain the entrance, or if the walkway to the entrance has something memorable that all readers will encounter when entering (that sets this park separate from the others), mention it! Again, best done by real-life instances that people know of, but could be done sometimes via looking at YouTube videos and Flickr images. Explain to your reader what the turnstile entrance entails - but not to the point where you'll be describing how the crank get's turned or the direction your entrance card gets you in (readers can already assume how these items work or can ask for help if needed when they arrive to that point). You can explain some of the signage on top of the entrance gates or even the theming of the paint scheme surrounding the turnstiles or similar ticket booths to let them know what they should be looking for to get them in.\n\n, Go the extra mile to get the reader psyched to know just what to expect when they get to the park. Even if the entrance of one ride and another is on opposite sides, as long as you group them together of nearby attractions, you can easily keep your reader thrilled and want to understand the step well enough.\n\nEstablish subsections of where the lands begin and end as the reader would walk through them. Set Steps up by themed land as with each land set as it's own subsection of the Steps top-level section of the article; Even if you can't read it or can't understand the best pattern of where the exits and entrances are - at least the readers can get a general idea of where the attractions are for themselves and can easily look to find the exact entrance pattern as they enter the park (of if they still can't find the item's entrance, can ask a nearby employee for help who should be able to give them better directions).\nIf you have an article that needs to be written that you have subsections for and don't know wiki-formatting all that well, rather write the article as is and leave out the subsection title headers and go back and add the subsections following these guidelines later using Guided or Advanced Editor formatting.\nParks not divided into individual lands can be set up as if the reader walks from one end of the park on one side to the back end of the park then coming back around and back to the main intersection where the turnstiles are.\n\n, For each remaining step that you set up, make sure they have information for each attraction - ride or show - that the park has. Although you want to avoid spoilers as much as genuinely possible, you can mention that there are certain areas that can't be missed and describe areas nearby the area that these rides show that this information could almost spoilers of, so the people don't miss them. Describe the ride or attraction using an action verb at the front. (Remember, some nouns can become verbs, but you'll want to catch yourself from using the better action verbs (by doing researching on the potential verb alone at first) to ensure the word can become a verb on it's own.)\n\nJust because some attractions aren't too famous, doesn't mean that it shouldn't be included. (Outside of food vendors) all attractions should be explained in some respect inside the article. (i.e. In SeaWorld parks, although roller coasters similar to Manta and the like are very popular, there are also rather minor attractions such as dolphin shows and the famous Shamu show along with Otter shows and tanks where different types of fish can be watched by the visitors that most people who write these types of articles often miss that really make the article informative.)\nIf you still need help describing the attraction, inside some theme parks, you can sometimes find theme-park fanatics who will go out and record rides and post them on YouTube as front-seat\/on-ride POV videos (as was described before).\n\n, If the park has any special fireworks or special daytime or nighttime parades, give them details into some of the parks' parades. Provide the location of the entrance point of the park and exit point and general parade route, if you have that information easily accessible.\n\nIf you have watched a recent showing of the parade and noticed a really great spot that was never crowded, provide this viewing spot referencing nearby attractions and from what side of the walking path you were on.\nDon't concern yourself on special fireworks or activities that only happen on select days. (i.e. While most readers will want information on the fireworks shows at the Disney parks (but these articles have been covered already), once you get into talking about the slight variations of Christmas and Halloween versions of the shows and their tweaks, you'll have lost your audience.)\n\n, At the very least, some great tips that fly well include well-sourced Tips about the date which this particular park opened (Grand Opening). Some of this information can be found and sourced from Wikipedia's information for the park. Other ideas to include can include these ideas.\n\nTips\n\nWhen 4-8 year old kids get antsy in this park and it seems like your day is lagging behind, give these kids some options. Even though this park has a few areas where kids can explore and run out all their excitement, this may sometimes not be enough. If you haul around a double-seat stroller, and warnings just don't work, give them time in the stroller. If they don't fit, you'll need to find some other way to draw out their energy. They will thank you for helping them \"take a load off their feet\". These youngsters tend to draw energy out more quickly, and become cranky quicker.\nKeep kids (under age 5) on \"leashes\" (arm straps) at all times. Don't allow your kids to remove them at any time. It's hard to see your kids leashed up like a pet, but with the large amounts of guests in the park at any time, security is of utmost importance, and their leashes will help immensely. Don't even remove them, when your kids are in their stroller, as it can take only a few seconds for the kid to get out and become missing (the leashes only would allow the child to go so far as you'd allow them to go).\n\n\nWarnings\n\nAlways ride the ride with safety in mind. Use all safety devices the ride operator provided for you and your family.\nRides occasionally close and change at this park. Don't fear if your favorite ride has changed or has become defunct. Something will be there to replace it over time. Their replacements might be just as good as the ride you once loved.\nEverybody's tastes are different. You can skip some rides if you don't have time or if the kids act up. Some kids might be too churlish to some rides, while other rides might be too intense for the younger crowd, so you may want to skip these rides.\n\n\n\n, Although all Disneyland and Disney World (USA)-based park Visit guides here have already been started as well as a few of the other named parks, categorize most of the Visit articles in Category:Carnivals Circuses and Theme Parks via either of these methods (dependant on your wiki-editor you are using). If you are using the Article Creation Tool, you will have to publish without a category and add it using the Guided Editor that is just as easy to use as the Article Creation Tool when editing an article; and which you'll find towards the bottom of the tool., Turn on the \"Sources and Citations\" section (for those who have had to cite their sources) in Guided Editor (check the \"Sources and Citations\" section towards the bottom of the page and publish) or if you are able to use the Advanced Editor, set up the \"Sources and Citations\" section and place the {{reflist}} template on the article in this section. If you are working from the Article Creation Tool, you must skip this and add this step's publication information manually from the Guided or Advanced Editors. Not doing so at any point of citing, will create cite (citation) errors which cause reader confusion.\n\nIf you have other research\/reference sources that are citable based on wikiHow's External Links policy, provide those in this section as well. Forego any eHow or About.com links as these are competitors websites which have been known to be from farm systems that can sometimes be unsuitable to be referenced on articles here due to those editors being paid to write their articles which can sometimes cause major gaps or inaccuracies\nDon't just say that the information is from a \"personal experience\"! If there was a webpage that gave you the idea to create it (besides this article) and this link doesn't violate this policy, provide it in this section with the notable words \"ideas from\" provided in the same line along with the website that gave you the ideas. (i.e. \"* ideas from (link URL here) \")\n\n, If you are using the Article Creation tool, you won't have this feature, however, once you publish and use the Guided or Advanced Editor, you can add Step-by-Step pictures in the article.\n\nThe Flickr tab in the Guided or Advanced Editor can be a lifesaver for most of people when they are in trouble, it can sometimes run you into trouble if the theme park isn't well-known or well photographed (such as theme parks outside of the United States\/Canada and some theme parks in Europe). Flickr tends to see people photographing rides from the outside (and sometimes inside) of famous (or can become famous later) rides. Include photos that have the main entrance (or close to main entrance) as the photo you'll use, but make sure the photo is specific to that specific park's entrance.\nUse the Local file tab to use pictures you yourself took of the ride. Click the \"Add Image to Steps\" button in Guided Editor or by clicking the add pictures button (which looks like a portrait of a mountain with a plus sign in the right hand corner of the portrait) on the tiny toolbar of icons at the top of the Advanced Editor (if you've chosen to utilize it for subsections) and utilizing the pictures under the \"Flickr\" tab and add the photo that way.\n\n, Although the Article Creation tool won't give you a place to explain what you are doing (and will automatically populate a field inside of the edits that need to be patrolled with this information), with the Guided and Advanced Editors, you'll need to add in an edit summary such as \"created new article\" or similar. Sometimes there will be another box that will help you populate these fields once you begin typing, but this helper object won't display unless you create them in the Guided Editor., Scroll down the page until you see the line of buttons and click the Publish button. It may take a few extra seconds for the article to compile and ask if you like what you see, but you can easily select Publish if you have all the necessary things this article has described here. If you aren't done with the initial publishing edit during this session, you can click the \"Save draft\" button.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":937}

{"text":" Pack the essentials: undergarments, shoes, a set or two of regular clothes, entertainment, medication and, for longer flights, basic toiletries. Some people fly as if they may never see their luggage again \u2013 and that has some merit. Keep in your carry-on the minimum of what you need to survive should you lose your luggage.\n\n\nMake sure to take all your medication and everything you need to be comfortable. Prescription and non-prescription medication are allowed. It\u2019s easier to get extra liquids through security if they\u2019re medically needed, like with saline solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to cut down on the amount of clothes to pack, choose items that are interchangeable. Stick to a few items that all go together, rather than completely separate outfits. Use accessories to spice up an outfit. For example, scarves are small and easy to pack, and can be used as a scarf, headband, or even a belt.\nTake your swimsuit if you are travelling by air, put it with in your vacation gear, especially if you are a woman. If your bags are lost when travelling by air, most items (such as shorts or T-shirts) can usually be purchased at your destination. However, if your bags are lost, swimsuits for women can be hard to shop for. If you do not have your swimsuit you may miss out on the beach, hot tub, or other vacation fun.\n\n\n\n\n\n;\n, Anything valuable should come with you in your carry-on. On the off-chance your luggage gets lost or damaged, your carry on should not leave your possession. If you'd be heartbroken if you lost it, take it in your carry-on if you take it at all.\n\nPack large electronics last, so they are easily accessible. You will not need to go digging around when time is of the essence.\n\n,\nThe TSA requires electronics to be screened \u2013 when they are all in the same place and easy for the agents to see, you won\u2019t be the one holding up the line at security.\n\n, In order to get on the plane, you need identification, such as a passport or driver\u2019s license. Do not forget your ATM card and credit card or AAA card. However, it is probably a good idea NOT to take every piece of plastic you own because you run the risk of losing the cards.\n\n\nIn an easily accessible pocket of your carry-on luggage, store your flight information: the airline, the flight number, your confirmation code, and the flight details. This comes in handy at the self-service check-in kiosks that so many airlines provide now at the airport.\n\n, You may not need to pack much, if any. Your Aunt Maria probably has shampoo, for instance, and Peru will likely have toothpaste. It may take an extra stop at a store on your travels, but by avoiding tons of bottles, lotions, and tubes, you save space for other, more important things.\n\n\nIf you do bring toiletries, in the United States the 3-1-1 TSA regulations still applies. You can fill as many 3 oz bottles of toiletries (100 ml) as you want into \u2018\u2019one\u2019\u2019 quart-size plastic ziplock bag (limit one per flyer), but you have to take out the bag at security screening.Go to www.tsa.gov for the full rules and regulations.\n\n, Sometimes flights can cause headaches, so have a pack ready just in case this happens to be that one. A few things you may want to pack:\n\n\nPainkillers\nBandages\nA sedative (if you are a nervous traveler)\nAnti-nausea medication\nChewing gum (for air pressure changes)\nTissues\nEarplugs (good for travel in general)\nMedication for anything you are prone to, such as allergies.\n\n, Remember you are not charged for the clothes you wear traveling, so dress with that in mind. Dress in layers so you can bring more with you. Instead of a T-shirt and jacket, wear a T-shirt under a long sleeved top under a sweatshirt, for example. Wear your hiking shoes and pack your flip-flops, especially when you are travelling for business., You can manage, which err n traveling by air, for a three month work trip, without checking any bags if you really want to. Checking luggage, for some, is a pain in the rear. You have to worry about packing it, dragging it with you, meeting weight requirements, likely paying extra fees that you did not know about, and then hoping the airlines do not lose it. If you are traveling for less than two weeks, consider it. It may be a challenge, but it is doable.\n\n\nFlight attendants and crew do it all the time. They can go over a week with just a carry on.If they can do it, so can you. You can then use the extra $50, if applicable, for whatever you please.\n\n, In addition to meeting the weight requirements, it\u2019s just easier to pack lighter \u2013 fewer things may get lost (via flying or when you leave them in your hotel room), it is a lighter bag to tote around, and you'll have plenty of room for souvenirs and impulse buys. And it'll take less time to repack.\n\n\nThough you should hold off on bringing too many shoes, you have to bring some. Shoe should be packed in plastic bags to avoid soiling your others goods unless they are brand new. Also, consider packing socks in your shoes rather than waste space.\n\n, Just in case something were to happen to your carry on, you forget to pack your carry-on correctly, or something unfortunate happens on your trip, put copies of important documents in your checked luggage. Scan your passport, visa, and anything else that you may need in the worst of circumstances. If you do it, you won\u2019t need it. But if you don\u2019t, you may.\n\n, If you are bringing toiletries with you, it is likely something will leak. Each item should be wrapped separately and stored in bags to make sure none of it gets on your clothes. Keep these in a separate area in your bag, too.\n\n\nTake the lid off of each bottle and plastic wrap the top; then put the lid back on. This means that even if the lid opens, you should still be fine., If you are not already rolling your clothes, get on the bandwagon. It prevents awkward square-shaped wrinkles and it saves room, so hop to it. Start with the heavier ones on bottom as lighter ones are generally more moldable to the shape of the top of your bag.\n\n\nThe tighter the roll, the more room you save. Even a little more compression here and there goes a long way.\n\n, Some airports are courteous enough to provide plastic bags for you, but if yours is not one of those, take them yourself. They are always useful, especially if you are traveling in a group \u2013 someone always forgets. And this way if your first round bags get soiled, you have a backup.\n\n\nThe zipper kind \u2013 the kind that literally has a zipper on it. The resealable ones are better than the non-sealable kind, but the zipper kind are best \u2013 the resealable kind can open when force is applied.\nHigh-quality zip-lock bags can also be used to pack your bag tighter. You can sometimes get to 1\/3 more room if your clothing is put in zip-lock bags, the air forced out, then sealed. It can also protect clothing from getting soaked in outdoor adventures and keep your dirty underwear away from your clean clothes.\n\n, To get the most out of your bag, you\u2019ve gotta pack it according to shape and size of your items. Start with the biggest, heaviest items on bottom and work your way up to the light items \u2013 this will make it easier to close your bag when all is said and done. If something is an odd shape, pack clothes around it \u2013 make it a point to never pack air.\n\n\nIn general, it's easier to back long, cylindrical items than odd shaped bottles and containers. In the future, to streamline your packing look for items that are of more basic shapes and sizes. They take up less room overall.\n\n, If you are planning to shop at fashionable Parisian boutiques on your travels, do not stuff your suitcase full of ordinary clothes. Leave room for your purchases in your bags., In some cases, it may be easier to ship your items by mail or by a service like FedEx or UPS. This may be very important if you are going on an extended trip or need special equipment, like winter camping gear., Your trip destination will determine the kinds of things to pack, and the length will determine how much of each item is to be packed. What days do you have special events planned? How can you use the same pieces over and over?\n\n\nIf you can, try to avoid needing a checked bag. More and more airlines are charging for that first checked bag, and a cheap flight can turn into an expensive one in a matter of no time. If flight attendants can live out of a carry-on for over a week at a time, so can you.\n\n, Checking before packing can help pinpoint what you really need. For example, Vermont typically has mild summers, but also has \"heat waves\" that can make it semi-tropical. Checking the weather will let you know if you really need to pack that tank top or that umbrella.\n\n\nTake a small amount of multipurpose items to deal with the climate of your vacation destination. For instance, one waterproof windbreaker takes less space than a raincoat and a jacket.\n\n, If you\u2019re going to a different country or overseas, odds are certain things will be different. Will you need an electronics adapter?\n\n, You may not be able to bring your Saudi host a bottle of wine, for example. Or take certain kinds of plant seeds to Australia.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":939}

{"text":" This game really requires more than about 10 people to play per team, that's why its commonly played at schools.;\n, A level floor playing surface is adequate enough, however, more often this game is played in a large gymnasium or other large open area where it is deemed acceptable to play a game similar to kickball.\n\n, Although you can use whatever \"base\" you'd like to use,as long as it's large enough for all the players to stand on the bases at the same time. The bases themselves tend to be gymnasium mats (thereby the reason why this game is called Matball).\n\n, Crossing that imaginary line makes the kicking player automatically safe. Most often times, this imaginary line is centered at the direct center of the area of the gymnasium floor - all so that the kicking player can have room to take action on the ball when it arrives.\n\n,, The kicker can either kick the ball and begin running the bases, or they let it slide past and into whatever is behind them. However, the outcome of missing this ball can be deemed to be either an out or just a miss, but must be based solely on the umpire or other officials officiating the game.\n\n, They can either run to the right (much like the current game of baseball) or towards the left and run from base to base until they reach home.\n\n, You can have many players on one single mat.\n\n\nSometimes, game officials give the teams an ultimatum when they reach base, in hopes that they are not called \"out\" at any time (outs are discussed a little later). They can continue running in hopes not to get stopped by any one baseball fielder near the mat, or they can stop and safely rest on the mat.\nRecognize what should happen in the case the player oversteps a base (even by just one foot). Most often times the game official gives players the opportunity to lead with their one lead foot, however, they must not come off the base or they can be thrown out to be considered \"out\". Most often times, once you leave a base, you can't return again to that same base.\n\n, Games vary from location to location and include (but are not limited to) these two universally-accepted rules.\n\n\nIf the ball is kicked behind home plate, it is considered to be a foul ball.\nIf the ball hits the ceiling of the location traveling forward, it is either a foul or out (dependent on location rules).\n\n, An out for a player is recorded when either the player has swung their leg and missed on several attempted kicks or when they swing and kick but the fielder catches with their hands, when the running player gets tagged while running the bases or during an altercation in the game that causes the out.\n\n, If the location's doors are open in front of home plate and the ball heads out the doors, some places consider the ball to be live at all times until the fielding team retrieves it, or it may be considered a home run. Sometimes if the game is played indoors inside a gymnasium and there are basketball hoops that have been raised and the ball travels into or through the baskets, it's an automatic home run, but that's only a general advisement and not a required idea to determine.\n\n\nRecognize that there are more scenarios than what are posed here, but vary widely upon each individual situation the location encounters.\n\n,, Sometimes, interference can be called in the field when some members of the fielding team are playing their position in or near the basepath and\/or to a certain extent so that the running player must collide with them to get to their next base. If this error is recorded, the player can safely be marked as safe on the next base, and the player who committed the error must sit out until the next inning or till the end of the game and can't be up to bat unless these players are elementary school age and are just learning the game.\n\n,, Sometimes, as long as theirs a ball in play and their is a runner on a base (or is running the bases) these teammates can continue running the bases. However, if you want, you can tell the teams that they have to stop after (x) amount of runs.\n\n, After several outs have been recorded by the kicking team, the side is out. If all players reach base without leaving any other players behind, you may end up waiting for someone to make a mistake and have all players leave their bases, but that won't happen very often.\n\n, Repeat this play after the two teams switch places (the kicking teams becomes the fielding team and the fielding team becomes the kicking team).\n\n, The team at the end of a few rounds or the one to record the most runs will win and the game will be over.\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":942}
{"text":" Such physicians are known as haematologists.\n\n\nTheir routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases, although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various haematological test results.\nIn some institutions, haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory.\nPhysicians who work in haematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases, referred to as haematopathologists.\nHaematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed.;\n, Haematologists may specialise further or have special interests, for example in:\n\n\nbleeding disorders such as haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\nhaematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia (onco haematology)\nhaemoglobinopathies\nthe science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank\nbone marrow and stem cell transplantation\n\n, Only some blood disorders can be cured.\n\n, Haematological analysis involves the determination of different blood parameters, which can be done using either the electronic quantification or the manual quantification.\n\n\nThe electronic quantification can be done with the use of the auto counter and these displace about 15 parameters, while the manual quantification of PCV for example, is by the use of the Micro haematocrit centrifuge. This Micro haematocrit centrifuge is used to determine the Packed Cell Volume (PCV), from which many other parameters can be obtained.\nThe best way to determine blood parameters is through the electronic device called auto counter because it gives accurate values and manual red blood cell counting is obsolete and inaccurate Although, the manual quantification is also used to confirm whether the values obtained from the auto counter correlate with it for PCV.\nThe haematocrit (Ht or HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF) is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. It is normally about 46% for men and 38% for women. It is considered an integral part of a person's complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and platelet count.\n\n, The term \"haematocrit\" was coined in 1903. Its roots stem from the Greek words hema- blood, and krites, judge - meaning to gauge or judge the blood.In mammals, haematocrit is independent of body size. The PCV of animals can also be determined, to know their anaemic state.\n\n\nElevated haematocrit - In cases of dengue fever a high haematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome.\n\nPolycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated haematocrit.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells. This increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia.\nProfessional athletes' haematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or Erythropoietin (EPO) use; the level of haematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in haematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the haematocrit level which causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks).\nIf a patient is dehydrated, the haematocrit may be elevated. Repeat testing after adequate hydration therapy will usually result in a more reliable result.\n\n\nLowered haematocrit - Lowered haematocrit can imply significant hemorrhage (for example, in an ectopic pregnancy).\n\nThe mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the red cell distribution width (RDW) can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal haematocrit, because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population. A low haematocrit with a low MCV with a normal RDW suggests a chronic iron-deficient erythropoiesis, but a high RDW suggests a blood loss that is more acute, such as a hemorrhage.\n\n\n\n, They include:\n\n\nInfants who may not have adequate iron intake\nChildren going through a rapid growth spurt, during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell mass\nWomen in childbearing years who have an excessive need for iron because of blood loss during menstruation\nPregnant women, in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron.\nPatients with chronic kidney disease, as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow.\n\n, This is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.\n\n\nIn newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.\nFoetal haemoglobin, (also hemoglobin F or HbF) is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.\nIn newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.\n\n, When fetal haemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult haemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of haemoglobin called haemoglobin S. This variety of haemoglobin aggregates, forming filaments that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped, which have a greater tendency to stack on top of one another and crowd blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are a hallmark of the disease.\n\nIf fetal haemoglobin remains the predominant form of haemoglobin after birth, however, the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and can be used to treat individuals with sickle-cell disease. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin\u2014rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone have been shown to further elevate haemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells.\n\n, This refers to the process of determining the genotype of an individual by the use of electrophoresis. Current methods of doing this include PCR, DNA sequencing, ASO probes, and hybridization to DNA micro-arrays or beads. The technology is important in clinical research for the investigation of disease-associated genes.\n\n\nDue to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial. That is, only a small fraction of an individual\u2019s genotype is determined. This experiment actually only determines the phenotype, not genotype.\n\n, Experiments with blood transfusions, the transfer of blood or blood components into a person's blood stream, have been carried out for hundreds of years. Many patients have died and it was not until 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered human blood groups, that blood transfusions became safer.\n\n\nMixing blood from two individuals can lead to blood clumping or agglutination. The clumped red cells can crack and cause toxic reactions. This can have fatal consequences. Karl Landsteiner discovered that blood clumping was an immunological reaction which occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells.\nKarl Landsteiner's work made it possible to determine blood groups and thus paved the way for blood transfusions to be carried out safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.\n\n, An adult human has about 4\u20136 liters (1.6\u00a0US\u00a0gal) of blood circulating in the body. Among other things, blood transports oxygen to various parts of the body. Blood consists of several types of cells floating around in a fluid called plasma. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. Red blood cells transport oxygen to, and remove carbon dioxide from, the body tissues. The white blood cells fight infection. The platelets help the blood to clot, if you get a wound for example. The plasma contains salts and various kinds of proteins.\n\n, The differences in human blood are due to the presence or absence of certain protein molecules called antigens and antibodies. The antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells and the antibodies are in the blood plasma. Individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules. The blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents.\n\n\nThere are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today, but the AB0 and Rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions. Not all blood groups are compatible with each other. Mixing incompatible blood groups leads to blood clumping or agglutination, which is dangerous for individuals. Nobel Laureate Karl Landsteiner was involved in the discovery of both the AB0 and Rh blood groups:\n\nABO blood grouping system - According to the AB0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups: A, B, AB or 0 (null).\nBlood group A - If you belong to the blood group A, you have A antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and B antibodies in your blood plasma.\nBlood group B - If you belong to the blood group B, you have B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and A antibodies in your blood plasma.\nBlood group AB - If you belong to the blood group AB, you have both A and B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and no A or B antibodies at all in your blood plasma.\nBlood group 0 - If you belong to the blood group 0 (null), you have neither A or B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells but you have both A and B antibodies in your blood plasma.\nRh factor blood grouping system - Many people also have a so called Rh factor on the red blood cell's surface. This is also an antigen and those who have it are called Rh+. Those who haven't are called Rh-. A person with Rh- blood does not have Rh antibodies naturally in the blood plasma (as one can have A or B antibodies, for instance). But a person with Rh- blood can develop Rh antibodies in the blood plasma if he or she receives blood from a person with Rh+ blood, whose Rh antigens can trigger the production of Rh antibodies. A person with Rh+ blood can receive blood from a person with Rh- blood without any problems.\n\n\n\n, According to above blood grouping systems, you can belong to either of following 8 blood groups:\n\n\nA Rh+\nB Rh+\nAB Rh+\n0 Rh+\nA Rh-\nB Rh-\nAB Rh-\n0 Rh-\n\n, You mix the blood with three different reagents including either of the three different antibodies, A, B or Rh antibodies. Then you take a look at what has happened.\n\n\nIn which mixtures has agglutination occurred? The agglutination indicates that the blood has reacted with a certain antibody and therefore is not compatible with blood containing that kind of antibody.\nIf the blood does not agglutinate, it indicates that the blood does not have the antigens binding the special antibody in the reagent.\nIf you know which antigens are in the person's blood, it's easy to figure out which blood group he or she belongs to! Application:\n\nA person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.\nA person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.\n\n\n\n, For a blood transfusion to be successful, AB0 and Rh blood groups must be compatible between the donor blood and the patient blood. If they are not, the red blood cells from the donated blood will clump or agglutinate. The agglutinated red cells can clog blood vessels and stop the circulation of the blood to various parts of the body. The agglutinated red blood cells also crack and its contents leak out in the body. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin which becomes toxic when outside the cell. This can have fatal consequences for the patient.\n\n\nThe A antigen and the A antibodies can bind to each other in the same way that the B antigens can bind to the B antibodies. This is what would happen if, for instance, a B blood person receives blood from an A blood person. The red blood cells will be linked together, like bunches of grapes, by the antibodies. As mentioned earlier, this clumping could lead to death.\n\n, Of course, you can always give A blood to persons with blood group A, B blood to a person with blood group B and so on. But in some cases you can receive blood with another type of blood group, or donate blood to a person with another kind of blood group.\n\n\nThe transfusion will work if a person who is going to receive blood has a blood group that doesn't have any antibodies against the donor blood's antigens. But if a person who is going to receive blood has antibodies matching the donor blood's antigens, the red blood cells in the donated blood will clump.\n\n, This is the localization of antigens or proteins in tissue sections by the use of labeled antibodies as specific reagents through antigen-antibody interactions that are visualized by a marker such as fluorescent dye, enzyme, or colloidal gold. There are numerous immunohistochemistry methods that may be used to localize antigens. The selection of a suitable method should be based on parameters such as the type of specimen under investigation and the degree of sensitivity required.\n\n, Cancer occurs as a result of mutations, or abnormal changes, in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy. The genes are in each cell\u2019s nucleus, which acts as the \u201ccontrol room\u201d of each cell. Normally, the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth: healthy new cells take over as old ones die out. But over time, mutations can \u201cturn on\u201d certain genes and \u201cturn off\u201d others in a cell. That changed cell gains the ability to keep dividing without control or order, producing more cells just like it and forming a tumor.\n\n\nA tumor can be benign (not dangerous to health) or malignant (has the potential to be dangerous). Benign tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal in appearance, they grow slowly, and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous. Left unchecked, malignant cells eventually can spread beyond the original tumor to other parts of the body.\nDuring the immunohistochemical staining of a tissue, antigens are usually expressed if the tissue stains positive. These antigens can either be breast cancer antigens or non-breast cancer antigens\n\nBreast Cancer Antigens under investigation\n\nA. Estrogen Receptor (ER)\nB. Progesterone Receptor (PR)\nC.

To better understand breast cancer, it helps to understand how any cancer can develop. The term \u201cbreast cancer\u201d refers to a malignant tumor that has developed from cells in the breast. Usually breast cancer either begins in the cells of the lobules, which are the milk-producing glands, or the ducts, the passages that drain milk from the lobules to the nipple. Less commonly, breast cancer can begin in the stromal tissues, which include the fatty and fibrous connective tissues of the breast.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":943}

Send out an email or have an in person discussion asking for feedback on any possible hazards in the workplace.Ask specifically about hazards that your employees think could result in significant harm, such as slips and trips, fire hazards, and falling from heights.\n\n, They can help to explain the hazards and put them in perspective in terms of how the equipment was made to be used and how misuse can lead to hazards.The manufacturer's instructions will likely be on the labels of any equipment or substances. You can also check the manufacturer's manual for more information on possible hazards associated with the equipment or substances.\n\n, These documents will help you identify less obvious hazards, and any hazards that have occurred before in the workplace.If you are in a management position, you can likely access these records for your company online or in the company files.\n\n, Long term hazards are hazards that will have an impact on workers when they exposed to the hazards for a long period of time.\n\n\nThese could be exposure to high levels of noise, or exposure to harmful substances over a sustained period of time. This could also be safety hazards through the repetitive use of equipment, from a lever on a work site to a keyboard at a desk., Depending on your country, you can access practical guidance on hazards in the workplace via a government health and safety guidelines website. These sites have a list of hazards and possible ways to control them, including recognized hazards such as working at height, working with chemicals, and working with machinery.\n\n\nIn the U.S., you can access the government health and safety guidelines website here: https:\/\/www.osha.gov\/.\nIn the UK, you can access the government health and safety guidelines website here: http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/.\n\n, You are creating an overview of all potential individuals at risk, so avoid listing every worker by name. Instead, make a list of groups of people in an environment.\n\n\nFor example, \u201cpeople working in the storeroom\u201d or \u201cpassers-by on the street.\u201d\n\n, You then need to identify what type of injury or ill health might occur for each group.\n\n\nFor example: \u201cshelf stackers may suffer back injuries from repeated lifting of boxes\u201d. Or, \u201cmachinery workers may suffer joint pain from repeated use of a lever.\u201d\nThis could also be more specific injuries like \"workers may be burned by the printing press\" or \"cleaners may trip over the wires under the desks\".\nKeep in mind some workers may have particular requirements, such as new and young workers, new or expectant mothers, and people with disabilities.\nYou will also need to account for cleaners, visitors, contractors, and maintenance workers who may not be in the workplace all the time. It\u2019s important to also identify any possible hazards to the general public, or \u201cpassers-by\u201d.\n\n, If the workplace is a shared space among several workers or several hundred workers, it\u2019s important to reach out to your employees and ask them who they think is at risk. Think about how your work affects others present and how their work affects your staff.\n\n\nAsk your staff if they can think of any group you may have missed when identifying who is affected by certain hazards. For example, you may not realize that the cleaning staff also has to deal with lifting boxes at your employee\u2019s desks, or you may not be aware that a certain piece of machinery is a noise hazard for pedestrians on the street.\n\n, Risk is a part of everyday life and through you might be the boss or the person in charge, you are not expected to eliminate all the risks. But you need to make sure you are aware of the main risks and you know how to address and manage these risks. So, you need to do everything \u201creasonably practicable\u201d to protect people from harm. This means balancing the level of risk against the measures needed to control the real risk in terms of money, time, or trouble.Keep in mind you do not need to take action that would be considered disproportionate to the level of risk. Don\u2019t go overboard on your risk assessment. You should only include what you could be expected to know, within reason. You are not expected to anticipate unforeseen risks.\nFor example, a risk of a chemical spill should be taken seriously and noted as a major hazard. But smaller risks, like a stapler harming someone using it or the lid of a jar hitting someone, are not considered \"reasonably practicable\". Do your best to identify major and minor hazards, but do not try to account for every possible hazard in the workplace.\n\n, For example, maybe you provide shelf stockers with back protectors and safety gear (also known as PPE, or Personal Protective Equipment). But ask yourself: Can I get rid of the hazard altogether? Is there a way to rearrange the storeroom so shelf stockers do not have to lift boxes from the ground? If this is not possible, ask: how can I control the risks so that harm is unlikely? Practical solutions include:Trying a less risky option. Such as having the boxes on a raised platform or ledge to reduce the distance the shelf stockers will have to lift from.\nPreventing access to the hazards, or organizing the workplace to reduce exposure to the hazard. Such as rearranging the storeroom so the boxes are placed at a level that do not require lifting by the shelf stockers.\nIssuing protective equipment or protective practices to your workers. Such as back guards, PPE, and information on how to complete an action safely. For example, you could educate shelf stockers on how to properly lift a box from the ground, bending at the knees, with a straight back.\nProviding welfare facilities, such as first aid and washing facilities. If your workers deal with chemicals in the workplace, for example, you should provide washing facilities and first aid close to their workstations.\n\n, Improving health and safety does not necessarily mean spending a lot of company money. Simple adjustments like placing a mirror on a blind corner to prevent vehicle accidents, or holding a brief training session on how to lift objects properly are all low-cost precautions.In fact, failing to take simple precautions can cost you a lot more if an accident does happen. The safety of your workers should mean more than the bottom line. So if possible, spring for higher-cost solutions if they are your only option. Spending money on precautions is a better choice than having to take care of an injured worker.\n\n, Many of these groups come up with risk assessments for particular activities, like working with heights or working with chemicals. Look at the National Institute for Occupational Safetyand websites that focus on a certain sector, like miningor administration.\n\n\nTry to apply these model assessments to your workplace and adapt them as necessary. For example, a model assessment may have suggestions on how to prevent a fall from a ladder in the workplace. Or a suggestion on how to make loose wires in the office more safe for employees. You can then apply these suggestions in your own risk assessment, based on the specifics of your workplace.\n\n, It\u2019s important to involve your workers in the process of evaluating the risks and coming up with possible precautions. This will ensure that what you propose will work in practice and won\u2019t introduce any new hazards into the workplace., The assessment should cover the hazards, how people might be harmed by them, and what you have in place to control the risks.\n\n\nIf you have fewer than five employees, by law you do not have to write down a risk assessment. But it\u2019s useful to do this so you can review it at a later date and update it.If you have five or more employees, you are required by law to write down the assessment.\n\n, There are several templates available online, based on the type of workplace you work in.A basic risk assessment should show that:\n\n\nA proper check of the hazard was made.\nYou asked who might be affected.\nYou dealt with the obvious, major hazards, and took into account the number of people who could be involved.\nThe precautions taken are reasonable and practical.\nThe remaining risk is low and\/or manageable.\nYou involved your employees in the process.\nIf the nature of your work changes often or the workplace changes and develops, such as a construction site, your risk assessment may have to concentrate on a broad range of risks that can be anticipated. This could mean the possible state of the site your workers will be building on that day, or the possible physical hazards in the area, like fallen trees or rocks.\n\n, If your risk assessment identifies a number of hazards, you need to rank them in order of importance. For example, a chemical spill in a chemical plant will likely be the most serious risk, and a back injury from lifting a barrel in the chemical plant may be a less serious risk.\n\n\nThe rankings of the hazards are usually based on common sense. Consider the hazards that could lead to serious injuries like death, the loss of a limb, or a serious burn or cut. Then, work down from the most serious to the least serious.\n\n, This could mean better spill prevention for the chemical plant, or a clear evacuation procedure in the event of a spill. You could also provide high quality PPE for workers to prevent exposure to the chemicals.\n\n\nNote if these improvements or solutions can be implemented quickly, or even with temporary fixes, until more reliable controls can be put in place.\nRemember that the greater the hazard, the more robust and reliable the control measures will need to be.\n\n, Your risk assessment may include the need for employee training on a safety practice, like picking up a box from the ground properly, or for training on how to deal with a chemical spill.\n\n, Another approach is to use a risk assessment matrix, which helps you determine how likely or unlikely a risk may occur in your workplace. The matrix will have a column for \u201cConsequence and Likelihood\u201d, which is divided into:\n\n\nRare: May occur only in exceptional circumstances.\nUnlikely: Could occur at some time.\nPossible: Might occur at some time.\nLikely: Will probably occur in most circumstances.\nAlmost Certain: Is expected to occur in most circumstances.\nThe top column will then be divided into sections for:\nInsignificant: Low financial loss, no disruption to capability, no impact on community standing.\nMinor: Medium financial loss, minor disruption to capability, minor impact on community standing.\nSerious: High financial loss, some ongoing disruption to capability, modest impact on community standing.\nDisastrous: Major financial loss, ongoing disruption to capability, major impact of community standing.\nCatastrophic: Mission critical financial loss, permanent disruption to capability, and ruinous impact on community standing.\nA copy of an example risk matrix can be found here: https:\/\/intranet.ecu.edu.au\/__data\/assets\/pdf_file\/0017\/207080\/how-to-write-a-risk-assessment-and-management-plan.pdf.\n\n, You are not required by law to share the risk assessment with your workers but it may be a good practice to share the completed document with them.File a hard copy of the risk assessment and keep an electronic copy on the company's shared drive. You want to have easy access to the document so you can update it or adjust it accordingly.\n\n, Few workplaces stay the same, and sooner or later, you will bring in new equipment, substances, and procedures that could lead to new hazards. Review your employee\u2019s work practices on a daily basis, and update the risk assessment. Ask yourself:Have there been any changes?\nHave you learnt anything from accidents or near misses?\nSet up a review date for the risk assessment in a year\u2019s time. If there is a significant change at your workplace during the year, update the risk assessment as soon as possible.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":944}
{"text":" Most people don't know what cheerleading really is. If your parents think that cheerleaders are mean people that do nothing but wave pom-poms, explain to them what you really want to do, how much you love cheerleading, and that all-star cheerleading is not the same thing as cheering for your school or football. Make sure you aren't putting them on the spot. Make sure they agree with you and you aren't pressuring them. They will more likely help you if you stay calm and show them your mature.;\n, Be happy, smile, make friends, don't be mean, laugh a lot, and be sporty! Remember that being mean and rude to other teammates could get you kicked off the cheerleading team, so remember to be nice to everyone in your team and outside our team. Also make sure that you pick a good team.\n\n, Before you become an all-star cheerleader, you need to know what all-star cheerleading is. Look up videos on Youtube or visit the USASF (US All-Star Federation) website to see how it's like being an all-star cheerleader. Know all the rules and levels so you'll have an idea what level you'll be on and what you'll be doing. And be sure to know the difference between all-star cheerleading and football\/basketball cheerleading before you sign up!\n\n, If you're tall and strong, you'll probably be a base or backspot. If you're short, flexible, and agile you'll probably be a flyer. If you're a combination of both, maybe you could be two things at a time!\n\n, Look on the website for pictures, look on youtube for videos, and see if on the website they have requirements for the team you want to try out for. For previews on competitions go to websites like Jamfest or U.S. Nationals. Remember to find a good team. If the team only has seven girls or goes in only two competitions a year, you might not want to join if cheerleading is your passion. Make sure you join a good sized teams with plenty of levels and that goes on competitions! And if possible, try joining a team that goes to Worlds.\n\n, Don't be lazy! You should practice a little everyday. Stretch and exercise.\n\n, Believe it or not, the more flexible you are, the less you'll get hurt, because your body will be so used to bending. Stretch every day and do a couple of strength exercises like crunches, lemon squeezes, and push-ups about three times a week.\n\n, Run at least once a week. Being strong can help you get better at a lot of cheerleading things, like jumping, tumbling, stunting, or maybe even dancing if your team's dance is fast and difficult.\n\n, Do tumbling, private lessons, or a be in a recreational team for about two months before you actually do the real thing, and remember that you must know the basics. Those classes will teach you all the basics. If you already took something like gymnastics or tumbling before, you don't really have to. The better you are at tumbling, the more likely you'll be able to make a higher level in your team.\n\n, Practice in front of the mirror and remember to squeeze your body the whole time. While doing motions, keep your fists straight up and tight, not bent! The better your basics are, the better your tumbling will be.\n\n, Practice every day and when you're sitting down, be in the position of the jump you want to learn\/improve. When you jump, whip your legs and arms as hard as possible and keep your arms tight (that's why basic motions are important in cheerleading).\n\n, It may sound silly, but dance is important in all-star cheer. If you don't know how to dance, you'll be all messed up while your teammates are doing great in a competition, and all all-star cheer routines have at least one dance part in them. Your dance moves should be clean and tight, and remember to do facials\/smile while you dance.\n\n, They are very important cheerleading skills. Remember that in most tumbling passes, a cheerleader will do a roundoff\/roundoff back handspring before she does the final trick. Even thought a back handspring is essential, don't attempt one unless your coach already gave you permission to, because if you did one by yourself and fell, that could lead to serious injury.\n\n, If you fall backwards, just do a candle rock with your arms straight above your head, and stand back up. If you fall forwards, tuck your chin in and roll.\n\n, If you have a fear of going backwards, just practice jumping backwards on a mattress and doing bridges. Remember that tumbling can sometimes be scary\/dangerous, so be prepared to fall, because it's impossible to never fall!\n\n\nDon't be scared in any position you take. If you're a base, make sure you get under your flyer and don't be scared. If you're scared then the flyer will be scared as well. Be confident. If your a back-spot, don't be scared as well. Make sure you're catching your flyer if you do cradles or baskets. You need to grab the flyer's ankles or the base's wrists and pull up to relieve some of the weight. When doing cradles or baskets, help push then step aside to catch.\n\n, Facials give you more points in competitions and just make your team look better while performing. You need to look like you're having fun in a competition, because if you look bored, you're probably gonna lose.\n\n, Once you feel prepared, sign up for try-outs. Don't worry, you always make the team when you're an all-star!\n\n, Smile all the time and don't attempt anything you can't do or anything too dangerous. Be confident and always stretch first. Wear comfortable clothes. Look at the judges\/coaches in the eye and pretend you're just at home and no one is watching!\n\n, Don't make cliques in your team and don't try to mess anyone up! Also, don't laugh at someone if they fell or they can't do a tumbling trick everyone else in the team can do.\n\n\nDon't cry, be upset, or be too hard on yourself. Always be positive, because all cheerleaders are supposed to have a positive attitude.\n\n, Granola bars or energy drinks can be good, but don't drink too much caffeine or you'll get too hyper and will not be able to tumble!\n\n, Even if you already have a back handspring, using a barrel\/roller will make your back handsprings even better than they already are.\n\n,,\n\n\nDon't be afraid. The more you're afraid, the worse it may be. Stay clam throughout your routine, keep your composure, and work on facials. Facials is what wins the judges over.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":945}
{"text":" a plastic bottle. You can use any you like, but 3 liter (0.8\u00a0US\u00a0gal) cider bottles would be better if you wanted a bigger biodome.;\n, The heavy, black plastic bottom has groves which add strength to the bottom shape. The oval dome lid snaps tightly onto this bottom.\n\n\nAfter enjoying the chicken, wash the container lid and bottom completely. (The big label sticker on the outside can be removed with a little Gumout or WD40). In the bottom fill the deeper grooves with coarse sand or fine, washed pea gravel.\nAdd real soil scooped out of your backyard with a spoon, building up about 1 inch (2.5\u00a0cm), patted down. Now, in your backyard or a city waste lot, find some small, low lying plants that are only a few inches high. Wet the area around each such wild plant with a cup of water. Then use a larger tablespoon to dig down and under the roots of the little plant you have watered, and gently lift it out.\nMany common weeds that are mowed, burned over or stepped on are fine. 2 examples would be wild strawberry, ordinary grass, or plantain. Even newly emergent seedlings, if they are small enough, will work.\nTaking care to keep as much of the roots and soil around them as possible when you lift them out, place them into the layer of soil you have put into the bottom. Now gather a few more such plants.\n\n, Even shingles on a roof often have moss on them that can be carefully scraped off. So after adding some compost soil or topsoil put some moss on the top and arranged around the little plants as a top ground cover. If the plants wilt a little at first, they will be fine when you water them if you have gotten most of the fine roots into the soil. Now sprinkle water gently until the soil, moss and plants are well watered. Your bottom plastic base will let excess water, and eventually the plant roots drain down into the deeper grooves.\n\n, Here you have to be careful no soil or plant parts are in the area you have to snap together. When you have snapped the lid. on correctly it will be tight and snug.\n\n,,, So, with a heated sewing needle (from a candle flame or match) you are now going to punch the hot needle through the upper sides of the dome roof in clusters of about 6 - 10 needle sized holes. #*Do this at each upper end, and the middle of each upper side. This will allow some moisture to escape so that the entire dome doesn't cloud or \"fog\" up. (The needle holes will be too small for bugs to escape.)\n\n, Once sealed up, these little biodomes will not need more water added for many months, even most of a year.\n\n, Cut 3 sides of the door only, so that the door can be opened and closed as needed, and use a tab of mending tape to keep the lid closed. For bugs, try to avoid earthworms. Small beetles or crickets or sowbugs are fine. Lacewings are good, and fruit flies will work too, if you can catch them.\n\n, Remember, you can also use a larger, fancy cake tray and dome that many grocery stores sell in the deli or bakery. The main thing with a larger such deli dome, is that you need the black plastic bottom tray to have enough rigidity and grooves for the sand and excess water.\n\n, But, what the heck - even if you have to eat the whole cake, it only weighs 3 - 4 pounds. Invite someone to help you eat it.\n\n, Firm it down to help stop bacteria.\n\n, Consider putting in these plants:\n\n\nFruit producing plants\nPerennial plants, plants that don't need much water\nSelf fertile plants\nPlants that produce a large amount of seeds.\n\n,,\n\n, Then, leave the seedlings (you should have about 3 or 4 evenly spaced) until they have covered most of the compost.\n\n,, If you want to be extra sure there are no gaps, put something like superglue around the joint.\n\n\nThe crickets or beetles will produce carbon dioxide that the plants will take in and give off oxygen as a by-product. The crickets will breathe the oxygen and the cycle goes on. The plants will be eaten slightly by the crickets, but, making sure they are fast growing, they will give the crickets or beetles the supply they need.\nOf course, the plants will take in the water you gave them, and they will respire and the water will just evaporate and condense, and will give the give the crickets something to drink and the plant something to drink. The crickets or beetles will get rid of the water one way or another, so it goes on.\nThe plants will get energy from the soil and light, the leaves will die off through time (replaced by new ones) and will rot into the soil, recycling nutrients and giving back the water that was retained in the leaves.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":946}

Balance your free time to include hobbies, family, and friends.\n\n, Just as you're growing physically and emotionally, you're also growing intellectually. Try reading books from different genres, from classics to science fiction. Try hobbies from arts and sciences. What is fun to you?\n\n\nLook for articles online about topics that you enjoy.\n\n, The media can have discouraging messages, such as hypersexuality, mean behavior, and rude and incorrect stereotypes. This is not healthy. Surround yourself with media that celebrates your values, and the type of person you want to be.\n\n\nLook for media that supports your self-esteem, especially in fighting negative stereotypes. A girl who loves robots could watch TV with women in STEM, a girl who uses a wheelchair could read books about people with disabilities, and plus-size girls can look at pictures of stunning women of the same size. Remind yourself that people like you exist and have worth.\n\n, Even the kindest, most cheerful people have bad days sometimes. It's okay to feel sad, get a bad grade on a test, or lose your cool every once in a while.

Hear them out, and then explain your point of view as calmly as you can. Work together to figure out a good approach.\n\n, When you see your parents or siblings looking like they need help (struggling with packages, doing chores, etc.) say \"Is there anything I can do to help you?\" Open doors for them, help carry things... little things can make a big difference.\n\n, The next time you see your parents or older siblings doing chores, try asking them to show you how. The two of you can do it together. You'll practice and help out at home, and then you'll be good at it when you're an independent adult. Learn how to cook, do laundry, do housework, and other basic tasks. Help out your parents and anyone you see who could use a hand.\n\n\nTry yard work like mowing your lawn, taking care of the plants, and weeding.\nTry your hand at basic engineering tasks, such as auto repair, changing a flat tire, and fixing a leaky tap.

If you see messes that are not yours, you can still help clean them up. Sweep, vacuum, put away clutter and dirty clothes, and clean things like windows and mirrors.\n\n\nCleaning up other people's messes is nice, and optional. Don't feel obligated if you don't have the energy.\n\n, Look for the things that you have in common, and have fun together. Speak politely to them (even when they annoy you!), and respect their boundaries\u2014they'll probably do the same to you in return.\n\n\nLet them have space when they need it.\nIf you can't handle your siblings right now, then don't.

Participate in class for even more points towards your grade.\n\n\nTeachers love it when you raise your hand in class, whether it's to give an answer or ask a question. If you give a wrong answer, it's okay.\n\n, Do your homework promptly every night and do the best job that you can on it. This will give you better grades, and it will also help you become more disciplined and responsible.\n\n, Cramming for three hours straight isn't good for your health, and you won't learn as much. Start working early to make it easy on yourself. Then you can take lots of study breaks and feel less pressured.\n\n\nDon't stay up late studying before a test. You need your brain to be fresh and alert, so get plenty of sleep in order to prepare.\n\n, Look at the teacher, face front, and focus on note-taking and listening.\n\n\nDon't chat, text, pass notes, or use your phone in class. These are disrespectful to your teacher and your peers who are trying to learn.\nIf you have a disability that causes you to fidget or appear inattentive to non-disabled people, let your teacher know. Find ways to accommodate your needs so you can focus.\n\n, Learn to ask politely for help if you are struggling in your classes. Most people love to give advice and be helpful, and your teachers want to see you succeed. Explain that you're struggling and ask for help. Their advice can help you, and they'll respect you more for it.\n\n, Remember the platinum rule: treat others the way they would like to be treated. This means being respectful and considerate.\n\n\nAs a general rule, don't say something behind someone's back that you wouldn't feel comfortable saying in their presence.\n\n, It's normal to have wants and needs, so be assertive and ask for things. Use \"I\" statements like \"I would like...\", \"I think...\", or \"When you ____, I...\"\n\n\nBeing passive might feel kinder, but it isn't. Hinting or beating around the bush will only confuse or frustrate people.\n\n, Listening and validating people's feelings are tremendously useful skills. This means treating them like what they say and how they feel is important (even if you don't agree with them). People will feel much better and start opening up to you if you do this.\n\n, Whether it's small like holding a door for someone, or big like creating a picture book for your little brother, random acts of kindness are a great way to be and feel good. Look for opportunities to make people smile.\n\n, If you think your friend's shirt is awesome, let him know. If your sister made a really cool science project, tell her how much you like it. Even a random compliment from a stranger can brighten someone's day.\n\n\nSometimes it's a bad time\u2014for example, you wouldn't stand up in the middle of a concert and shout \"I love your singing!\" You can wait until a good moment (e.g. after the concert), or tell other people about your thought. People always feel happy when they learn you've been saying good things about them behind their back.\n\n, Everybody has positive traits, so look for them in each new person you meet. Treat them with the assumption that they are well-meaning and intelligent in their own way. They may just rise to meet your expectations.\n\n\nKeep doing this, and you will be a ray of sunshine that inspires others to be their best.\nA few people are mean and rude no matter what you do. Keep a safe distance from these people, and continue being positive. It may rub off on them, or it may not.\n\n, It can be tempting to write people off as \"weird,\" \"stupid,\" or \"stuck up.\" Don't. Everyone has a story, and is struggling in a way that you might not notice. Treat everyone like they are good at heart.\n\n\nBe respectful to everyone, including the people you don't like. They may warm up to you.\n\n, Courtesy will show others that you are considerate and mature. Use the phrases \"please\", \"thank you\", and \"may I\". Let other people go first. Get a book on everyday etiquette, or ask someone who appears to be particularly knowledgeable on it.\n\n, People may say things that don't make sense to you\u2014but they probably have a good reason. Instead of giving up or getting mad at them, ask questions. This works in a variety of perplexing situations, from a person who is acting strange to someone who is being mean.\n\n\n\"That's interesting. Why would you say\/ask\/do that?\"\n\"I don't understand. Could you explain it?\"\n\"I'm surprised that an educated and considerate person like you would stereotype transgender people like that.\" (Compliments can defuse rude behavior.)\n\n\n, Nobody can truly \"win\" an argument. Calm yourself down, or excuse yourself if you don't think you can handle it calmly. You can always continue the discussion later when you have a cooler head.\n\n\n\"I need to take a break.\"\n\"I don't know how to respond to that.\"\n\"I'm so upset, I don't know how to handle this. I'm going to take some quiet time.\"\n\n, You won't get along perfectly with everyone, and that's okay. Spend your time and energy on the people who build you up and make you feel good. They can help you feel happy and remind you of the person you want to be.\n\n\nYou're allowed not to be best friends with everyone. If you feel upset when you're around someone, be polite to them, and focus your attention elsewhere.\n\n, A good girl doesn't rush into romance, and makes sure that she is ready before trying something new. Communicate with your partner, and talk about kissing and intimate touching before you do them.\n\n\nLearn how to say no. An \"I don't want to,\" \"Not tonight,\" \"I'm not ready for that,\" or just plain \"no\" makes it clear to your partner how you feel.\nLearn to recognize danger signals. Some people are disrespectful: they push your boundaries, laugh off your discomfort or worries, or trash-talk other people. Steer clear of them.\n\n, When someone does something kind for you, let them know you're grateful with a simple smile or \"Thanks!\" Give them a hug or some kind words sometimes, so they know how much you care.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":948}

{"text":" Thrush, or oral candidiasis, is caused by an overgrowth of a type of fungus, or yeast, called candida albicans. Candida is a normal part of the body.Candida albicans is naturally found throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. Candida is also a normal resident of the skin.A thrush infection happens when the candida albicans yeast cells find a source of nutrients they like, and grow beyond what is considered normal.;\n, White, patchy areas on the tongue, and other parts of the mouth are the most common symptom.Additional symptoms include inflamed, or reddened, areas in the mouth, accompanied by soreness. This can cause a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and a loss of taste.Some areas might bleed slightly if they are scraped.Cracking, itching and pain at the corners of the mouth is common with oral thrush., Understand the risks of untreated thrush infections. Candidiasis infection, like thrush, left untreated can result in serious health problems.Candida is normally present on the skin, and throughout the gut, and causes no health problems.However, when an overgrowth occurs, it is important to treat the condition before it spreads further, and gains access to the systemic circulation. A systemic candidiasis infections is called invasive candidiasis.Realize the seriousness of an invasive candidiasis infection. Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the candida infection spreads into the systemic circulation, called candidemia.This type of infection is a serious condition, and can affect the blood, heart, brain, eyes, bones, as well as other parts of the body.People with weaker immune systems are the ones primarily at risk of developing invasive candidiasis. This type of infection requires hospitalization, involves added expense, and, in some cases, results in less than desirable outcomes.Invasive candidiasis is a major type of infection acquired by patients being treated in a hospital or facility setting for other reasons.See a doctor early. Seeking medical attention early and taking a prescription medication are the best ways to effectively manage the initial symptoms of a candida infection.This is the most effective approach to prevent invasive candidiasis and candidemia., It is somewhat rare to see oral thrush in healthy children, adolescents, and adults. But anyone can develop thrush, and the infection is easily treated.Since this condition is considered unusual in healthy people, there may be an underlying cause for the thrush to have developed.In addition, some conditions may look like candida, such as oral cancers or precancerous conditions, so make sure to see you doctor if you are haven't had thrush before or if it does not go away with treatment.\nIt is recommended that cases of thrush be evaluated by a doctor to provide both effective treatment, and to be sure there is no change in the person\u2019s overall immune system., According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thrush, or candida, infections that develop in the mouth or throat require the use of prescription medications for effective treatment.The exact medications and the length of treatment will vary depending on the person\u2019s age, general health status, currently prescribed medications, and immune system strength.Make sure that you complete the full prescribed course of medication, or else the thrush may return.\n\n, Treating oral candidiasis is often done by using a product that can be applied topically. This is especially true for infants and young children.Liquid products, such as nystatin oral suspension, are applied topically by either swabbing, or \u201cpainting\u201d, the suspension onto the surfaces infected. Nystatin is effective at treating the infection, and is safe if swallowed.In addition to using liquid forms, antifungal creams, ointments, and oral doses such as troches, deliver the medication in a topical manner.Use dissolvable prescription products. Some products are made in dissolvable forms, called troches, that are placed in the mouth to dissolve.This method of administration allows the medication to come into direct contact with the infected areas., In some cases, the medication may be prescribed in a tablet, capsule, or liquid form, that is intended to be swallowed.The antifungal medication works through systemic absorption, just like taking an antibiotic.Some examples of medications prescribed to treat thrush include fluconazole, nystatin, itraconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, posacanazole, and miconazole.These medications can interact with other medications, so be sure to tell your doctor what medications you conditions you have. They can also have side effects, so call your doctor if you develop any new symptoms while taking these medications.\n\n, Infants that develop a thrush infections typically have the white, patchy, lesions, in their mouth. They may have trouble feeding, and be more fussy and irritable.The infant can pass the infection to the mother, then they continue to pass it back and forth, until the infection is effectively treated.The mother\u2019s breasts can become unusually sensitive and reddened, with cracked and itchy nipples. The circular area around the nipple, called the areola, can turn shiny, with flaky skin areas.The mother may experience pain during nursing or notice pain in the nipple area between feedings. The discomfort may also feel like stabbing pains deeper within the breast., Tell your doctor if your baby has a diaper rash also, as candida may also cause a diaper rash, and your baby may need different treatment for this. If your doctor considers the case to be mild, he or she may recommend just using good hygiene measures, and watching the areas in both baby and mom for a few days.Treat the baby. If treatment is warranted, the medications can be easily and safely applied.In many cases, an antifungal product called nystatin suspension, can be prescribed. This is a liquid medication that can be applied directly into the baby\u2019s mouth to the areas involved.\nThe applications are often recommended several times a day for about a week.Treat mom. To allow the mother to continue breast feeding and disrupt the cycle of passing the infection back and forth, the same medication, or a similar one, may be prescribed.\nTopical antifungal creams or ointments are applied to the affected areas of the nipple on mom\u2019s breast. Applications are usually recommended several times a day, for about a week, until both baby and mom are symptom free.You may also want to consider using disposable nursing pads to avoid passing the infection to your clothing.Talk to your doctor about cleaning or boiling items such as bottles and nipples, pacifiers and any detachable parts of a breast pump to reduce the chance of the infection coming back.\n\n, People that are diabetic, are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids, take certain types of antibiotics, and people that wear dentures, develop oral thrush infections more often than otherwise healthy adults.Some people with serious illnesses that involve weakened immune systems more commonly experience oral candidiasis.These groups include people with HIV or AIDS, people receiving cancer treatments, and people that have had organ transplants., Make an appointment as soon as possible to have the thrush infection evaluated and treated.The doctor will choose the appropriate prescription medications based on the overall health and existing medications of the person with thrush.People that are elderly, have asthma or COPD, and people with weakened immune systems require quick intervention to prevent the thrush from spreading into their bloodstream.\n\n, The at-risk groups are more challenging to treat since most are already taking a combination of medications that can sometimes interact with antifungal drugs.\n\n\nThe doctors know how to properly combine the antifungal medications needed, with their current prescribed drugs, to quickly and effectively treat the thrush infection.In some cases, intravenous therapy and hospitalization may be the safest course of action., One scientific research study looked for evidence of efficacy for natural and herbal products claiming efficacy in treating oral candidiasis. Unfortunately, the researchers were not able to find any evidence to support the claims.This does not mean the natural and herbal products do not work. The study results suggest that further studies, following proper scientific research methods, are warranted in order to show efficacy for these treatment approaches., When you have a thrush infection, warm saltwater rinses may provide some relief.Ask your dentist or doctor about using saltwater rinses to be sure it is the best option for you.To make a saltwater rinse, dissolve \u00bd teaspoon of salt in 1 cup of warm water.\nSwish the rinse around in your mouth. Be sure to spit out the rinse and avoid swallowing it. Repeat this several times a day., Scientific research has shown that probiotics containing the lactobacilli species can help to control the overgrowth of candida albicans in some situations.The study authors recommend additional research in this area, but the initial work done in a controlled research setting was promising., The scientific literature suggests this to be possibly helpful in treating thrush. However, products available are not adequately regulated and exact dosing recommendations are not available.Talk to your doctor about specific products or sources, recommended by him or her, to treat thrush in this manner.Yogurt containing live or active cultures of the lactobacilli species are difficult to find. Yogurt products are now required to undergo processes like pasteurization that kills the live cultures.\n\n, If you choose to try gentian violet, talk with your doctor first, then proceed carefully. Since safer and easier products are available, using gentian violet is often considered to be unfavorable option.\n\n\nGentian violet is effective in the topical treatment of fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, but the product is difficult to use. The product should not be swallowed, and will stain the skin and clothing.Side effects of gentian violet include redness, and irritation at the site where it is applied. Gentian violet should not be swallowed. Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting can result. If gentian violet is swallowed, call a poison control center.One study found that gentian violet applied topically using a 0.00165% product was somewhat effective at treating oral thrush and did not stain the affected areas., See your dentist regularly, and follow recommendations provided by your dentist or your regular doctor.General recommendations to prevent thrush infections include brushing your teeth at least twice each day, floss once a day, and never share your toothbrush., Some people have trouble reaching all areas of their mouth with a regular toothbrush.Talk with your dentist about switching to an electric toothbrush if this will help you to more effectively clean your teeth., If you have recently had a thrush infection, you may want to replace your toothbrush several times.Use new toothbrushes, and discard any contaminated ones, until you are comfortable that the infection has been effectively treated, and your new toothbrush has not been contaminated., Some mouthwashes and rinses can alter the normal flora in your mouth, and allow for the candida infection to get started more easily.Talk to your dentist to be sure. Many dentists recommend the use of mouthwashes and mouth rinses., Sugary foods, and foods and beverages that contain yeast, can encourage the growth of candida.\n\n\nLimit the amounts of these foods that you eat or drink, and be sure to brush your teeth after eating., People that wear dentures at a higher risk of developing oral thrush infections.Your dentist can suggest different products and equipment to use in cleaning your dentures if this is happening to you., By maintaining tight control of your blood sugar levels, you can reduce the amounts of excess sugars that are found in your saliva.This helps to limit the sugary food source in your mouth area that helps the candida yeast to grow., Research has provided good evidence that this can help reduce the risk of oral candidiasis infections in people receiving cancer treatments.The most commonly prescribed prescription strength mouth rinse contains a solution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate., Some people with lung conditions, like asthma and COPD, regularly use inhaled corticosteroids.If you can, use a spacer (or aerochamber) attached to your inhaler. This greatly reduces oral thrush from using inhaled corticosteroids. Both children and adults should use spacers. In addition, they help the medication go deeper into the lungs instead of to the back of the mouth.\n\n\nPeople that use these products can reduce their risk for getting thrush by rinsing their mouth with water, or a doctor recommended mouth rinse, after each use of their inhaler.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":950}

At the beginning, you will start on straight paths: later go where there are some crossroads too: you will repeat \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\" any time you turn one or another direction.\n\n, If you are not sure, ask your vet about any doubt! Then, over weeks, slowly add speed and duration. Again, if in doubt, ask your vet, and anyway, better do less than the dog could do, than doing more and hurting him.\n\n,, Keep on praising and encouraging him when he runs in front if you, pulling you. If you notice he is unsure about what to do, increase your speed to make him understand he does have to run in front of you, faster than you, even if you are slowing down.\n\n, At the beginning, do not ride the bike, but run by its side: once the dog will fully understand how to behave, you can start actually riding\n\n, This step is not much different than passing from jogging to biking, but sled for sled dog are difficult to handle if you are not used to. Also, to pull one, you need at least three dogs, of the same size and weight.\n\n, Also, this is a demanding activity so it is important your dog is fit and well muscled to avoid injuries.\n\n, Also follow his\/her warnings on how to proceed.\nwhen you start, start with something that is not more demanding than your dog's usual activity: if he is used to walking for 5 minutes a day, start with a 5 minutes walk.\nadd difficulties gradually and slowly: a general rule is that when the dog, once home, stops being as tired as usual but only appears satisfied and still ready to go, it is time to add duration\/speed. For example: you start off with a 20 minutes walk, and once home your dog is not willing to do anything more for the whole day; let's say that after 2 weeks, he comes home tired but after, say, 6 hours he is ready to play and run again: then, you can start adding difficulties, for example from 20 to 25\/30 minutes walk\ntrain your dog for many activities: only doing one kind of activity\/training and nothing else is unhealthy and can lead to injuries ( it happens with humans too ). Instead, alternate sled dog\/running training with at least 2 other completely different sports, like disc dog ( lots of jumping ), agility ( jumping and sprinting ), swimming, etc. Also, teach your dog \"tricks\" ( things like: roll on the floor, give paw, etc. You can find many examples if you search for \"dog tricks\" on youtube ): they develop strength, agility and flexibility in dogs, which lead to less injuries, better performance, longer life and better health for the dog.\ndo not overtrain your dog: learn and respect his limit, never force him to do something he is scared of, uncomfortable with. Always bear in mind that doing a bit less than your dog could, will cause no damage, while doing only a little bit more, might cause serious injuries, that might take very long to heal.

The particles in the liquid layer are more often half to a tenth or smaller of the size of the particles in the solid layer of the rumen.\n\n, They are hard to feel for, however, as they are much softer and pliable projections of the rumen than things like pimples or muscles. The papillae are round-shaped projections with a narrower base near the wall of the rumen, and are responsible for absorption and uptake of nutrients into the cow's bloodstream.\n\n, There are two main contractions: primary and secondary.\n\n\nThe primary contraction is the most pronounced and can be the most startling if you've never felt it before: the smooth muscle of the rumen contract in on themselves to mix digesta and microbes together to increase digestion ability.\nThe secondary contraction is less defined and may be harder to notice until you've identified it after the 2nd or 3rd contractions.\n\n, You may have to go in up to your shoulder, especially if you have short arms, to feel this.\n\n\nThe esophagus is basically a \"hole in the wall\" with sphincter muscles, and is located above the reticulum into the rumen.\n\n, The reticulum is always located in front of the rumen below the esophagus, and can be identified by feeling for the skin making a sudden peak from the rumen towards the front of the cow.\n\n,,\n\n\nIf you are the last one to examine the cow, the plug must be replaced soon after to keep stomach contents from being expelled.

{"text":" If you're new to an area, you can ask the county planning department whether your home is at risk for flooding.You can also check government sites for flood maps. Be sure to check back every so often; the maps are sometimes redrawn as conditions change.The main factor determining your risk is whether you are in a floodplain or not, which you can check with flood maps.Several other factors put you at risk for floods. For instance, if your main floor is below the base flood elevation in an area, you're at risk for flooding. You're also at risk if your near a body of water, such as a lake or a river. You're especially at risk near the ocean.;\n, That is, know the best ways in and out of your neighborhood and other areas of the city when it's flooded. You'll need to stick to higher ground if you need to evacuate. Also, have a planned meeting place for your family members if you get separated. Have the plan written down. Go over it together so everyone knows what to do.The best way to plan an evacuation route is to use flood maps, which will show where the worst flooding will be in your area.When planning your evacuation route, have an established place to go. For instance, you can set up a plan with a friend ahead of time to evacuate to his or her house, or go to your workplace if it is out of the flood zone. Many communities also have areas designated for emergencies where you can go.\n\n, That is, show them the emergency numbers you have displayed in your home. Show them how to dial the numbers, and go over what they need to say in an emergency. Also, have a safety contact in the neighborhood that they can go to if they have a problem., Designate one person who is not in the immediate area as the person your family checks in with. That way, at least one person will have all the information who is not in immediate danger., When thinking about how you will evacuate, don't forget to include your pets in your plan. Have enough carriers for all your pets so that you can evacuate them with you if needed.Carries keep pets contained so you can evacuate them without harming them.Don't forget to include other items for your pets. They'll need containers for food and water, as well as food and their normal medications if you evacuate. Remember, not all emergency shelters will allow pets. Also, try to take something that will remind them of home, such as a toy or blanket.If you must stay in your home, move your pets to the highest point in the house with you., If possible, buy flood insurance so that you can recover from the damage of flooding. If you live in an area with low risk, insurance shouldn't be too expensive. If you live in an area with higher risk, it will be more expensive, but it will be worth it if flooding ever destroys your home. In fact, you are required to have it in a high risk area if you have a federally insured loan.You can get insurance through a federal program, the National Flood Insurance Program, by filling out forms on their website., For water, that means packing enough for each person to have a gallon per day. For food, pack non-perishable foods like canned goods that you don't need to cook. Keep these supplies in a waterproof container.Don't forget to include a can opener with your food, as well as some utensils for eating.Also, remember your pets need to eat and drink, too, so take them into account., You'll need a multipurpose tool that includes items like a screwdriver and knife. You also need extra phone chargers and a spare set of keys., Keep a first aid kit in your box, along with a supply of soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, and other toiletry items. Antibacterial hand wipes are also good to keep on hand., These items can include things such as sunscreen, bug spray, emergency blankets, and rain boots., That is, have a weather radio with extra batteries. You'll also need to keep friends and family informed, as well, so remember to have emergency contact information on hand., As noted earlier in the article, you can ask the your county planning department about the frequency of flooding at a potential building site.If you have no choice about where you build and you're located in a flooding area, you need to build an elevated, reinforced house to protect against flooding., Your furnace, air conditioner, electrical unit, and hot water should all be lifted above the ground to keep them from being flooded.Also, electrical outlets and wiring should be a foot above any flooding that's likely.You should have a professional perform these tasks.\n\n, Make sure you have copies of all of your insurance policies, pictures of your possessions and home, and any other important documents in a safe place. You either need to keep them in a waterproof box in your home or in a safety deposit box., A sump pump pumps out collected water, usually in basements. If you're home is prone to flooding, put one in your home, and be sure it has a battery back up in case your electrical goes out., These valves prevent flood waters from coming up drains., Have a professional evaluate your home and create barriers around your home that will prevent water from entering your house., If you have a basement, have the walls sealed with a waterproof sealer, which will help keep water out of that area., Turn on the weather radio for reports on flooding in the area so you can stay informed., If you have standing water, turn off the electricity by flipping the main breaker switch to your house's electricity. You should also turn it off if you plan to leave when there is flooding or if you see power lines on the ground., You should locate it ahead of time. Generally, you turn the handle a quarter of a turn until it is perpendicular to the pipe to shut off the gas. You'll need a crescent wrench to make the turn., Usually, you will need to turn a small valve to the right several times to turn it off., Wash the areas with a bleach solution, and rinse them clean. Fill them up to have clean water available to you. Also fill up any other pitchers or containers you have with water., If you have furniture or grills, bring them inside or tie them down to secure them., If you have enough warning, move any important items, such as electronics or valuable furniture to higher ground, such as upstairs or in the attic.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":953}

If so, what is the best treatment option for the pain?\nWill your child need to be temporarily admitted to the hospital?\nWhat are the procedures for you and your child before, during, and after the surgery?\nWhat are some things that you'll need to bring with you to the hospital (insurance information, emergency contact numbers, etc.)?;\n, No two children are alike, regardless of whether or not they're autistic, and you'll need to make sure that the doctor is aware of any potential medical afflictions that could cause complications with your child's surgery. Even if your child has no other health issues except for the one resulting in the surgery, you may need to tell the doctor about things like your child's contact lenses or any past surgeries or medical treatments. Oftentimes, you'll fill out a form detailing your child's medical history, but ask the doctor if there's anything else they need to know.\n\n\nMention any health issues or requirements to their doctor. For example, if your child is prone to seizures, has any allergies, or has a medical condition such as diabetes, the doctor will need to know.\nBring up pre- and post-surgery needs, too - for example, medications your child may need to take in the morning, or if their diet should change after the surgery.\nIf your child is on any existing medications and will need to go on a new one after the surgery, work with the doctor to find a medication that won't potentially conflict with your child's existing medications.\n\n, Autistic people may struggle with the change in environment or certain factors of the environment in the hospital, and the doctors and nurses want to help accommodate them and make them more comfortable. Ask about accommodations that your child could be given before and after their surgery, and during a hospital stay. A few examples of these accommodations are:Can your child be sedated before administering an IV?\nIs it possible to remove unnecessary equipment from the pre-operative room to prevent high anxiety?\nCould the doctors and nurses remove laboratory coats before entering the child's room?\nWould it be possible for very few people to come in at a time, to avoid scaring your child with the amount of doctors or nurses?\nIf your child can reliably communicate, can your child speak or use AAC instead of you communicating for them? If they use AAC, what kind of AAC can they use?\nCould your child be in a post-operative room that does not have harsh, flickering, or buzzing lights? Can the lights in the room be dimmed, as an alternative?\nCan the nurses make sure you're in the room when your child wakes up?\nCould you and your child tour the hospital so that your child can be more familiar with the setting?Discuss comfort objects with the doctor as well. For example, you could say something like, \"My child is autistic and needs to carry a stuffed fox to keep calm. Can we make sure that she has her fox when she falls asleep and when she wakes up?\"\n\n, Autistic people can have an unusual recovery time compared to neurotypical people,and even if your child recovers at the typical pace, they'll still need time to rest and recover. Do everything possible to avoid scheduling the surgery on a week that's busy for either you or your child, whether it's because of their school, your work, their therapy, or any outside activities that may potentially conflict with the surgery or the recovery period.\n\n\nThere are four types of surgery - major surgery (such as to correct issues caused by birth defects), minor surgery (such as correcting a bone fracture), elective surgery (when you schedule the surgery beforehand), and emergency surgery (such as for a potentially fatal heart defect).Depending on the type of surgery, your scheduling options may be limited, or you may not be able to schedule it yourself.\nIf the child's surgery can't wait until there's a break from school, then you will need to discuss your child's surgery with their teacher and school attendance.\nIf you absolutely can't avoid scheduling their surgery when everyone is busy, then cancel any non-important events that you can, move your child's therapy appointments, arrange to pick up their schoolwork, and make sure that there's always an adult able to care for your child. Your child's recovery is more important than their speech therapy.\n\n, Even if your child is nonverbal and never appears to be paying attention to you, they can still listen and understand what you're saying, and it's important that they know what's going on. While it's recommended to talk to toddlers and preschoolers early due to their limited concept of time, and to older children as soon as possible so that they have advance warning, consider your child's memory and skills at changing their routine when it comes to talking to them about the surgery.\n\n\nTry using social stories, a picture schedule of what will happen at the hospital, or reading age-appropriate books with your child about surgery, and exposing your child to the sort of equipment they may see while at the hospital with toy medical kits.The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has a slideshow for autistic children that explains what happens at the hospital, which can be accessed here.\n\n\nBe careful about the language you use. Don't say things like, \"The doctor will cut you open\", \"You'll be put to sleep\", or other language that may be associated with a scary or sad event. Instead, say things like, \"The doctor is going to fix your stomach so that it won't hurt any more\", or \"They'll help you sleep for a few hours. When you wake up, I'll be there with you\".Portray the hospital workers as kind and helpful people, not as people who will punish your child for misbehaving.If your child is a literal thinker, try to avoid using figurative language at all, to lessen the risk of confusion.\n\n, Your child may be very frightened of the upcoming surgery and regress to younger behaviors or start using harmful stims. Be patient and be there for them. Remember that it's normal for any child to regress to younger behavior when under stress, and that they need your support and care right now.\n\n\nIf your child is verbal or has access to complex AAC, encourage them to share their concerns with you. This can help you comfort your child about the things they feel worried about.\n\nValidate their feelings and make sure they understand that they aren't getting surgery as a punishment.Tell them that it's okay for them to cry and be scared.Try encouraging them to engage in therapeutic play, such as \"playing hospital\", before the surgery, to make the process more known and less scary. It will also help your child learn the routine of a hospital setting.\nDon't lie to your child to relieve their fear - they'll figure out that you were lying. If they ask if something is going to hurt, say something such as, \"Yes, it will hurt, but it will be over quickly\"., It's often recommended to feed your child soft \"safe foods\" after surgery, even if the surgery wasn't oral or gastrointestinal, and they're going to need some help managing their pain. Before your child's surgery, make sure that you purchase foods and pain relief medications, pick up any prescriptions, and any medical supplies that they may need (such as ice packs or bandages). Check with your child's doctor to see if there are any necessities.\n\n\nYour doctor may recommend getting over-the-counter drugs for your child's pain, such as Tylenol, or give you a prescription. Avoid aspirin-based OTC medications, and check with the doctor about whether ibuprofen is safe to use.\nGo shopping with your child, if they can handle it, to help them pick out foods and drinks that they'd like.\nPick out clear liquids and smooth, bland foods for your child. Examples include non-textured ice cream, pudding, apple or white grape juice, soft noodles, soup broths, and applesauce.\nYour child may be disappointed that they can't eat foods that they normally would eat, or that they have to eat only bland or smooth foods. Empathize with them and remind them that once they feel better, they'll be able to return to their typical diet.\n\n, Your child will most likely need rest afterwards, so find things they can do. A child who is hyposensitive to pain will need activities to help them stay resting, while a hypersensitive child may be in a lot of pain and will benefit from distraction.\n\n\nStop by your local library for books and movies.\nVideo games may or may not be appropriate, especially if you have a big-screen TV where your child can lie down while playing games.\nConsider buying your child a gift they can enjoy while relaxing, such as a new book about their special interest, or a relaxing video game. This will cheer them up.\n\n, Hospital passports are a strategy used to help accommodate autistic children in the stress of a hospital environment. Write down your child's likes, dislikes, sensory sensitivities and cravings, communication methods and strategies, ways to help them adjust, and things that your child is interested in.This can help the doctors and nurses work with your child, and gives information to anybody who gets involved in the situation a bit later than anticipated.\n\n\nTry making a few copies of the hospital passport, so that you can give them to nurses. You can also put one in your child's suitcase if they need to be admitted.\nYou may want to put other information, such as your child's medical history or emergency contact numbers, on the hospital passport.\n\n, In the cases of some surgeries, your child may need to be admitted to the hospital while they recover to ensure that there are no complications. If your child will need to be admitted to the hospital, pack the bag with them, and tell them what you're packing. Pack them a bag that contains things such as:Clothes and\/or pajamas\nShoes or slippers\nSmall travel-sized toiletries, such as shampoo\nToothbrush and toothpaste\nStim toys, preferably low-energy ones\nObjects or activities that the child enjoys, such as books, stuffed animals, or movies\nPreexisting medications - sometimes. Check with the hospital on whether to bring them.\nBe careful with bringing electronic devices. Some hospitals don't allow things like cell phones and tablets, and they're easy to lose or break. However, if your child needs an electronic device to communicate, talk with the hospital staff to see if they'll make an exception.\nDon't pack anything that you or your child would not want to get lost or broken, as things can get lost, damaged, or accidentally thrown away in the hospital.\n\n, If your child has siblings, they'll need to be informed of the upcoming surgery and that your child will need to rest and recover. When discussing the surgery with the child's siblings, explain to them as much as they can understand, and encourage them to ask questions and express their emotions.Don't leave them in the dark about it, or they may become confused, scared, or betrayed - be upfront and honest.\n\n\nSiblings in particular may be feeling a range of emotions about your child's surgery, and may express them in ways such as acting out, trying to get attention (whether by constantly pestering you or pretending that they're sick), not eating or sleeping as much, withdrawing from friends or family, or requiring more attention than they used to.These are signs that they are under stress, and should be addressed.\nYour child's siblings may be worried about home life changing and them not being cared for as much. To combat these fears, set aside blocks of time for you to spend with your child's siblings, and keep the care routines as normal as possible. Offer extra encouragement and praise for them when they do good things., Your child's surgery will undoubtedly be stressful for you, too, and it's important to get support from others. Seek out help from friends, your parents or siblings (if possible), and\/or your partner. If necessary, talk to a mental health professional about your fears. Don't let your fear and stress eat away at you.\n\n\nRemember, it's completely normal to be worried about your child during this time. You aren't being silly or having unjust fears.\nIf you have friends or family members who have also had a child who has undergone surgery, ask if they can give you some advice. While techniques for neurotypical children may not work for autistic children, there's some advice that is universal, such as the type of comfort objects your child should have, or how to ease your worries during the surgery.\n\n, In many cases, your child will not be able to eat or drink anything starting from midnight of the night of the surgery, so it's best to make them a meal that they'll eat a lot of. Make sure they drink enough, too. Encourage your child to eat as much as they'd like, and maybe give them a treat for dessert afterwards.\n\n\nSome surgeries require that your child is on a specialized diet before the surgery.If this is the case, then you're unfortunately not going to be able to follow this step, unless there's something in the restricted diet that your child especially enjoys.\nIf your child has poor impulse control, hide the food away and stay with them to make sure they don't try and sneak food. If your child eats or drinks before the surgery, the surgery will have to be postponed or rescheduled.If your child needs to take medication in the mornings, discuss with the doctor whether or not they can take their medication on the morning of the surgery.\n\n, This doesn't mean to put their clothes on for them if they don't need that kind of help, but to help them pick out clothing that is comfortable and won't get in the way. Choose clothing that is light, comfortable and can be easily slipped off, as they may have to change into a hospital gown.\n\n\nIf your child wears contacts, encourage them to wear their glasses instead.\nBring a jacket or sweater for your child. Hospitals are often cold. However, be careful with a sweater if you think your child will resist changing from their clothes to a hospital gown - it can be difficult to get them to take them off.\nIf your child has long hair, encourage them to leave it down. Buns and high ponytails can interfere with the ability to rest their head comfortably on the pillow. However, low-hanging hairstyles (such as side ponytails or braids) can help keep your child's hair out of their face and look great as well.\n\n, Autistic children often stim to express emotions or keep calm in stressful environments, and it's not considered unusual for children to carry around a comfort blanket, toy, or object. Allow your child to pick out something that they can carry with them for comfort, and request that the doctors and nurses don't suddenly take it from your child.\n\n\nIt's best to take something big, rather than a small fidget toy, as these are less likely to be lost.\nFocus more on your child's comfort than whether the toy looks age-appropriate. It's okay for anyone of any age to be carrying around a big stim toy or stuffed animal if it helps them keep calm.\n\n, You will probably not be able to leave the hospital while your child is undergoing the surgery, so bring things that can keep you occupied during the waiting period. Hospitals sometimes have reading material in waiting rooms, but consider bringing things like:\n\n\nWritten games (crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc.)\nElectronic devices, if they're permitted, and any chargers for these devices\nWork projects\nBooks or magazines\n\n, When your child is being checked into the hospital for their surgery, make sure to mention any health problems that your child may have, and bring up their needed accommodations to the nurses working with them. It can be helpful to the nurses to remind them of your child's needs, which, in turn, helps your child.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to bring up your child's autism. If your child will need extra support because of their autism, it's actually best to bring it up so that the nurses are aware and can give your child some extra support and accommodations.\nIf you're bringing up your child's autism, say \"autistic\" or \"autism\" rather than \"Asperger's\" or \"PDD-NOS\". It's entirely possible the nurses aren't familiar with diagnoses of anything other than autism.\nAsk the nurses to avoid restraining your child under any circumstances to avoid panicking them.\n\n, Since your child is under stress, it's quite possible that they may lose some of their abilities. Be extra patient with your child, and keep an eye out for things they might be struggling with.\n\n\nIf you suspect your child may lose their verbal ability, bring a form of AAC that they can use.\nThe stress may be especially overwhelming to your child if they get aggravated by sensory input, broken routines, or even just having not eaten for several hours.\nDo everything possible to help your child avoid a meltdown or shutdown.\n\n, During the pre-surgery preparations, you and your child may need to wait, which can result in your child becoming anxious. Stay with your child and keep them company, and do whatever they find calming, whether that means that you don't say anything as they play with a stim toy or that you talk with them until the doctor arrives.\n\n\nRemind them that they will be okay, and that you'll be there when they wake up.\nIf your child is in pain, do what you can to distract them from the pain. That can be anything from distracting them with a TV show on the hospital TV, to offering deep pressure through a hug or rubbing their back or hand.\nHelp them redirect their stims if they begin using agitated and harmful stims.\n\n, Many children are scared of needles and IVs, and it can be tough to get any child to cooperate with you when needles get involved. Distract them from the process by offering a stuffed animal, a stim toy or encouraging them to infodump while the IV is inserted. If your child is nonverbal, talk to them about a happy event or something that you know they really enjoy.\n\n\nIf your child is receiving anesthesia or sedatives through a mask, they may try to pull the mask off their face. Talk to them throughout the process and try to hold their hands (but don't restrain your child).\n\nNever pin your child down - restraining your child will result in them becoming fearful or panicked and fighting you, and these practices have been proven to not be beneficial.All autistic children are different. A hyposensitive child may not even feel the IV going in, while a hypersensitive child may attempt to jerk away from the IV in fear.\n\n, Many autistic children find comfort in having a familiar person nearby, and parents are often encouraged to stay with their children before the surgery process anyway. You don't need to talk to your child (though it's recommended, to calm them); just being in the room with them can be a big help.\n\n\nYou will not be allowed in the operating room, which may frighten your child if they're still awake. Tell them that you'll be there when they wake up.\n\n, When your child wakes up after their surgery, they'll likely be confused and disoriented. Talk softly to them and make sure they know you're there. It can take some time for your child to wake up fully, so be patient with how long it may take.\n\n\nDon't wake your child before they're ready, despite how much you might want to. They need rest, not only to heal faster, but to also allow administered pain medications to kick in.Some parents report their autistic child trying to pull the IV out of their arm.While the nurses are trained to deal with children doing this sort of thing, you may want to stay near your child during the wake-up process.\n\n, When your child comes home, they're going to need different care than is normal for them, and you aren't going to be able to remember it all off the top of your head. You may either get this information during or after your child's surgery, but be sure that you receive post-operative care information in a written form so that you aren't left scratching your head in confusion when your child needs later treatment.\n\n\nPrint-outs from the doctor detailing post-surgery care can be useful, if they're available.\nTake notes on how to treat your child's wound, what activity they can and can't engage in, what they should and shouldn't eat, who to call if there's an issue, who the follow-up appointment will be with, and what symptoms are and aren't normal.\nWrite down the doctor's phone number in case you need to call them about your child's treatment.\n\n, Many surgeries no longer require your child to stay for an extended period of time at the hospital to recover; however, some do, or there may be potential complications or health problems that result in the need for a longer stay. It's quite possible this will distress you and your child, especially if an unexpected event has resulted in the need for admittance, but keep it in perspective and explain it to your child. Remember, the hospital workers are trying to help your child get better, not take them away from you.\n\n\nMany hospitals will allow you to stay overnight with your child during their hospital stay. However, if that isn't the case, make sure they have comfort objects, enjoyable activities, and things that remind of them of home.\nIf you need to leave the hospital while your child is there, tell them where you are going, why, and when you should be back.If you need to be gone for long periods of time, have another family member (such as your partner) stay with them.\nConsider creating a schedule for your child if they need to be in the inpatient ward for more than a day, so that they have a routine., Your child may still be very tired from the anesthesia, but even if they aren't, it's important to make sure they rest to help the healing process. For the first few days, encourage them to rest as much as possible and to only get up to use the bathroom, and to let you know when they need something that requires getting up.\n\n\nWhen your child wants to sleep, roll them onto their side. It's not uncommon for children to vomit after having been under anesthesia,and if they're on their side, they're much less likely to choke if they vomit in their sleep.\nMake sure your child is resting, even if they feel capable of performing normally. A hyposensitive child may try to go about their life as normal, which can potentially injure them or slow their healing.\nIt's common for children to sleep more than usual for a few days after surgery, or to be wobbly and unsteady at first. Constipation, gas, urinary retention, nausea, sore throats or jaws, and dizziness are also common. These symptoms should wear off within a few days., If your child is still stressed out and is unable to communicate reliably, or if their surgery affected their mouth or throat, they may not be able to speak. Autistic children who can normally use one form of AAC may also need to temporarily regress to a simpler form of AAC while they recover. Pick out a form of AAC that would work best for your child, since they'll need to be able to communicate with you during recovery.\n\n\nA child of any age can try ringing a bell or pressing a button to call for you.\n\nThe Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), or cards with request words (e.g. \"drink\", \"toilet\", \"lonely\", \"hurt\") written on them, can be useful for requests or even expressing basic emotions, but can't be used for conversation.\nCommunication boards can be used to express emotions and requests, but they can't be used for conversation. It can also be hard for a child to use them if the surgery or effects of anesthesia have affected their motor skills.\nComplex AAC apps, writing, and typing can work for school-age children who have developed enough fine motor skills to use them.\n\n, Early on in the recovery process, it's discouraged to give your child solid foods, but it's still important to keep your child hydrated. Make sure they have clear liquids easily accessible to them - such as water, apple juice, ginger ale, or Popsicles- so that they stay hydrated. It may be a good idea to keep a sealed cup with a straw by your child's bed, so that there's less of a risk of your child accidentally knocking it over.\n\n\nIf your child isn't vomiting, then you can try giving them a light meal, such as soup or crackers.Make sure that your child can tolerate the food's texture or flavor.\n\n, Your child will probably not be able to do most things on their own, even if they're normally fairly independent. They may need round-the-clock care, or need to be checked on periodically. Make sure that your child is being cared for and checked on often enough, and that you're nearby so that they can call for you or otherwise get your attention.\n\n\nIf you need to leave the room for a short amount of time, get another person to watch over the child, or give them an object such as a bell to ring if they need you. Older children who have cell phones can be advised to text you.\nRotate caregivers. Maybe your spouse could watch over your child while you run out to the store or pharmacy, and your child's siblings could spend time playing board games with your child while you're making dinner.\nBring your child their box of stim toys if they feel the urge to stim.\n\n, Your child may need to take medications, use ointments, have a hot or cold compress applied to the surgical site, have bandages changed, or otherwise need special care. Be sure to follow these instructions to help your child heal and prevent infection or illness.\n\n\nTalk with the child while helping them with these procedures, so that they aren't caught by surprise and they understand what's going on. For example: \"I'm going to put an ice pack on your neck now. It's going to be cold, but it will help your throat feel better and help you heal faster.\"\nDon't restrain your child during these processes, even if they struggle. It will just result in your child becoming fearful of these times. Work with them to find a way to make it manageable for them. If your child really will not cooperate no matter what you try, however, contact their doctor and ask if there's an alternative way of treating your child.\n\n, Figure out who is in charge of the child's medicine, and make sure that everything is administered as instructed and according to schedule. Even if your child is older and more responsible, someone should be with them when they are taking their medicine, to make sure they are doing it correctly.\n\n\nDo not expect the child to keep track of their own medicine, even if they're normally able to. The exhaustion of surgery may make an otherwise-responsible child unable to reliably take medicine according to the doctor's orders.\nTry keeping a checklist to track what has been taken already.\n\n, If your child is curious about things, they may want to explore the surgery site and its stitches. While you shouldn't discourage your child's curiosity, make sure they understand that they shouldn't touch the stitches or prod at the area around it. Tell them that if it itches, they need to not scratch, as it can break the stitches. Encourage them to learn about surgery by showing them age-appropriate books or websites about surgery and stitches.\n\n\nIf you suspect that your child will pick at or excessively touch their stitches, put soft pads or gauze over the stitches to prevent them from pulling the stitches out.\nBe especially cautious if the surgery was in an area that might be frequently touched on a regular basis (e.g. their hand or mouth). Help your child with tasks that involve this area so that they don't accidentally injure themselves or reopen the wound.\nPick pajamas and clothes for your child that are less likely to potentially rub against the surgery area and cause discomfort, or snag on stitches.\n\n, Especially if your child's surgery requires an extended period of resting, it may be easy for them to get bored or restless, or they may want a distraction from the pain. Offer them activities that require minimal energy, such as:\n\n\nWatching TV or a movie\nReading books\nUsing a computer or tablet for games\nColoring in a coloring book, or drawing\nStimming with low-energy stim toys\nEngaging in their special interest, such as researching or using low-energy toys\nIf your child is further along in the recovery process, it may be okay to give them some higher-energy activities or stim toys. However, don't allow them to engage in intensive activities, sports, roughhousing, or any other activity that may potentially injure your child., Surgery can be very painful and stressful for an autistic child, so spend time with them and calm them down. If your child is struggling emotionally, it can help to have a loved one nearby.\n\n\nRead to them.\nHave conversations, if they are up for it.\nSit next to them while you do everyday things, like reading or fiddling with your phone.\nOffer cuddles if your child likes them.\n\n, Hypersensitive children in particular may be extremely sensitive to pain and struggle with pain management after surgery. If distraction isn't enough, then you may need to administer pain medication, whether it's over-the-counter or prescription medication. Pain medications often exist in both liquid and pill form;choose what your child is capable of taking and tolerating, and follow the instructions on the prescription or on the post-surgery care instructions. Contact your child's doctor if your child is still in pain when the medication has kicked in.\n\n\nRecognizing pain in autistic children can be difficult, especially if they're hyposensitive or nonverbal. However, if your child seems extremely subdued or shows less interest in their activities than normal, is crying, is \"protecting\" the pained area, is expressing pain or making noises that suggest pain, is grinding their teeth, or is unable to use a part of their body (e.g. unable to stand after their leg was operated on), they may be in pain and need medication.Avoid giving your child ibuprofen or other NSAIDs unless their doctor says it's okay; these medications can cause stomachaches or diarrhea, and can cause potential health complications if your child has kidney issues, blood clotting or heart problems, or asthma.Check on your child's pain periodically. While some autistic children may have trouble using a plain 1-10 scale that's often used to describe pain, it may work to write down what the numbers would entail (for example, writing under 10, \"I hurt so much that I can't focus on anything else\"). It's best to give your child pain medication when the pain isn't extremely intense, since it can take longer for the medicine to take effect when the pain is extreme., If your child's school isn't on break, they'll most likely need to get the classwork and homework assignments that are being assigned. You or another caretaker of the child can pick up their homework and bring it home, or a friend or sibling who attends the same school can talk to your child's teacher and drop off the homework. It's best to not let it pile up until your child returns to school, since it can be immensely stressful to your child to receive a large stack of papers on a single day.\n\n\nEncourage your child to rest rather than do homework in the early days. Your child may be worrying about missing a lot of schoolwork, but after surgery, recovery is more important than schoolwork. It's often encouraged to prevent your child from doing heavy lifting (such as lifting backpacks or textbooks) after surgery, anyway.\nUse the internet to your advantage. Some teachers will offer homework assignments, lessons, or the daily schedule online, especially in the later grades. Others may be willing to send photocopies of the assignments over email.\nDepending on how long they are out of school, ask if they can record the day's lesson to review and catch up later.\n\n, If your child has siblings, those siblings may get bored or frustrated more easily when your child is recovering from surgery, especially since your time has to be unequally divided between your children. To avoid your other children getting agitated or being unkind to your recovering child, involve them and have them help out and spend time with your child. Help them understand how your child is feeling and encourage them to play with and talk with your child to help them feel less lonely.\n\n\nOlder siblings may be able to help out with some mild care tasks, while younger siblings can help by playing games with your autistic child. Both age ranges can come and get you if your child needs something.\nDon't overwhelm them with sibling time - just set up a block of time for your child's siblings to spend with them (e.g. half an hour every few hours) so that your autistic child doesn't feel lonely and that their siblings are more involved. Be prepared to cut the time short, too.\nYounger siblings may pester your autistic child about the surgery and why they can't do what they can normally do, which can be a source of frustration for your autistic child. Make sure your younger children understand that they should talk to you about the more technical aspects of the surgery and recovery, and leave the personal questions (e.g. \"What was the hospital like?\") to your child.\n\n, Your child may take some time before they feel they're ready for more than just liquids, and that's okay. However, when they're ready, try serving the soft foods you bought to your child to adjust them to eating more solid foods. Don't force your child to eat if they don't feel ready, though - just make sure they get enough fluid intake.Stay away from giving them food that has to be heavily chewed, food that's very spicy, or something that could otherwise interact with the surgical area and dislodge a blood clot.\nYour child may reject foods that don't align with their sensory preferences, or refuse to eat things that they may eat when not under stress. Don't take it as a cause for alarm - it's normal for autistic children to refuse certain foods under stress, and eating enough is more important than eating well.\n\n, It's normal for your child to be disoriented or slightly groggy after the surgery. Hypersensitive children may also report frequent and intense pain. However, most of these symptoms should wear off a from few days to a week after surgery; if your child is not showing any signs of improvement, speak with the doctor as soon as possible, as illness after surgery may indicate a serious problem. Contact the doctor immediately if you notice that your child has any of the following symptoms:Fever or chills\nExcessive bleeding (however, oozing blood on bandages is often normal)\nPersistent vomiting, lasting for several days\nExcessive swelling around the surgical site\nSigns of infection - extreme pain to the touch (more than what's typical for your child), leaking pus or drainage, redness, hot to the touch, or a bad smell\nSigns of a poor or allergic reaction to a medication\nDifficulty breathing\nIrregular heartbeat\nSigns of shock - dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness, clammy skin, severe sweating, low to no urine output, chest pain, anxiety or agitation, blueish lips or nails, and a rapid yet weak pulse, As your child recovers from surgery, they'll begin to feel more capable of taking on certain tasks, like working on their schoolwork or getting back into sports or clubs. However, they'll still need to rest, since their body isn't finished healing yet. Make sure that your child doesn't overwhelm themselves with work, and encourage them to do their activities slowly and cautiously, even if they feel like they don't need to go slowly.\n\n\nSet up allotted time for your child to work on a given activity, such as working on their homework. When the time is up, encourage them to rest, or give them a low-energy activity to do, like watching their favorite movie.\nMake sure they take breaks from daily activities, even if they feel like they don't need them. Returning to normal activities before the healing process has completed can be detrimental to your child's health.\n\n, The recovery process can be frustrating, upsetting, or painful for any child, and your child may be moody, distraught, or irritable while they're recovering. You may be frustrated, too, whether because your child is irritable or because the recovery process is stressful. Remember, though, that your child can't magically make themselves get better and that taking out your frustration on them will upset them and make them feel guilty or like they're burdening you. Do your best to be patient with your child during the recovery process, without snapping at them or doing actions that would otherwise upset them.\n\n\nContinue getting support from family and friends. You're allowed to be frustrated or upset, and you don't need to feel guilty about it; it just isn't the best idea to express that in front of your child. Talking to others gives you an outlet without potentially upsetting your child.\nRemind your child when they're frustrated that they will get better, and that it's okay for them to be upset or annoyed at the recovery process. If they're verbal and lash out at you, don't take it personally - many people say things they don't mean when they're aggravated or upset.\nIt will be okay - your child will recover, even if it's not on the schedule that most people would expect, and they won't be in pain forever. Don't stress!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":955}

{"text":" And just like anything we do in life, fear comes from \u2018not knowing\u2019. So imagine what you could accomplish if you could perform home wiring safely and confidently. Imagine saving thousands of dollars over the years, if you could do-it-yourself!;\n, It\u2019s very important that you do not get in a hurry. Make sure that you have planned your project adequately, and that you\u2019ve allowed plenty of time to complete your project, or at least if you have to pull off of it and come back to it later, that you find a suitable stopping point, and that you can do without the circuit that you\u2019re working on.\n\n, It\u2019s not only dangerous. It is lethal. Shut the power off to any circuit that you are working on. (This means turn the power off at the circuit breaker panel. Just switching off a wall switch does not turn off the power in the wires.) Confirm the power is off with a simple pocket tester, a multi-meter, or lamp, blow dryer or another similar appliance.\n\n,, Fiberglass ladders are non-conductive. Don\u2019t use an aluminum ladder. Spend the money for a good fiberglass stepladder.\n\n,, Never work barefoot or in socks or slippers, and don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s safe to work without rubber-soled shoes on concrete floors. Concrete is conductive, particularly when it\u2019s damp (a good reason to never load or unload your washing machine while you\u2019re barefoot).\n\n, Even if by definition it\u2019s called an insulator. (A conductor allows the flow of electrons, and an insulator resists the flow of electrons).\n\n, OSHA requires us as contractors to lock it off, and tag it out with a procedure called lock out\/tag out. It involves red tags and devices that will lock the breaker off to prevent it from being turned on. (If you have your panel cover off, remember that even when you turn breakers off, there are still energized components in the panel itself!).\n\n, or \u201cDanger\ufffd?, or something similar, so anybody who approaches that panel will see that, and immediately know what\u2019s going on.\n\n,, Put your other hand either in your pocket or behind your back, and that\u2019s a good practice to develop anyway. What that does is keeps you from grabbing a circuit with two hands and providing a path for the electricity to flow through your heart.\n\n,, It is well worth spending a little extra money to purchase quality tools. I\u2019m referring to hand tools like your lineman pliers, screwdrivers, wire strippers, and other hand tools that you will use for electrical work. For instance, Good wire strippers will prevent you from nicking or skinning the wires. Good screwdrivers will prevent slipping out of screw heads or rounding them out. You get my point; good tools not only improve the quality of your workmanship, but improve your confidence as well. So don\u2019t skimp on tools. You can stock your tool pouch with good quality tools for $100 or less.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":957}
{"text":" Although you can stack cakes of any shape, traditional layer cakes are round. 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9\u00a0cm) round pans work best.;\n, Layer cakes often bring together complimentary cake and frosting flavors.

{"text":";\n, When VBA works with data, execution speed is partially a function of the number of bytes that VBA has at its disposal. Thus, the fewer bytes used by data, the faster VBA can access and manipulate the data.\n\nThe Decimal data type is rather unusual because you can\u2019t actually declare it. It is a subtype of a variant. You need to use the VBA CDec function to convert a variant to the Decimal data type.\n\n, The following list contains some examples of assignment expressions that use various variable types. The variable names are to the left of the equals sign. Each statement assigns the value to the right of the equals sign to the variable on the left.\n\n\n\nDataEntered = True\nDateStart = #04\/18\/2015#\nInterest_Rate = 0.025\nLoanAmount = 2000000.00\nMyNumber = TheNumber * 1.25\nUserName = \u201cTerrence O'Malley\u201d\nx = 10\nx = x + 1\n\n\n\n, If you attempt to use one of these words, you get an error message. For example, although the reserved word Next or True might make a very descriptive variable name, the following instructions generate a syntax error: Next = 64; True = True., If an instruction produces a strange error message, check the VBA Help system to ensure that your variable name doesn\u2019t have a special use in VBA. If the Auto Syntax Check option is turned on you get the error: Compile error: Expected: variable. If Auto Syntax Check is turned off, attempting to execute this statement results in: Compile error: Syntax error. It would be more helpful if the error message were something like Reserved word was used as a variable., For integer calculations, you can use the Integer type which is limited to values less than or equal to 32,767. Otherwise, use the Long data type. Using the Long data type even for values less than 32,767 is recommended, because this data type may be a bit faster than using the Integer type. When dealing with Excel worksheet row numbers, you want to use the Long data type because the number of rows in a worksheet exceeds the maximum value for the Integer data type., Data stored as a Variant changes type, depending on what you do with it.\n\nThe following procedure demonstrates how a variable can assume different data types:\n\nSub VariantDemonstration()\nTheVar = \u201c124\u201d\nTheVar = MyVar \/ 2\nTheVar = \u201dAnswer: \u201d & TheVar\nMsgBox TheVar\nEnd Sub\nIn the VariantDemonstration procedure, TheVar starts out as a three-character string. Then this string is divided by two and becomes a numeric data type. Next, TheVar is appended to a string, converting TheVar back to a string. The MsgBox statement displays the final string: Answer: 62.\n\n\nTo further demonstrate the potential problems in dealing with Variant data types, try executing this procedure:\n\nSub VariantDemonstration2()\nTheVar = \u201c124\u201d\nTheVar = TheVar + TheVar\nTheVar = \u201dAnswer: \u201d & TheVar\nMsgBox TheVar\nEnd Sub\nThe message box displays Answer: 124124. This is probably not what you wanted. When dealing with variants that contain text strings, the + operator performs string concatenation.\n\n\n\n, Here\u2019s a modified version of the previous procedure. This version displays the data type of TheVar at each step.\n\nYou see that it starts out as a string, is then converted to a double, and finally ends up as a string again.\n\nSub VariantDemonstration3()\nTheVar = \u201c124\u201d\nMsgBox TypeName(TheVar)\nTheVar = TheVar \/ 2\nMsgBox TypeName(TheVar)\nTheVar = \u201cAnswer: \u201c & TheVar\nMsgBox TypeName(TheVar)\nMsgBox TheVar\nEnd Sub\n\n\n\n, A user-defined data type can ease your work with some types of data.\n\nFor example, if your application deals with customer information, you may want to create a user-defined data type named CustomerData:\n\nType CustomerData\nCompany As String\nContact As String\nRegionCode As Long\nSales As Double\nEnd Type\n\n\n\n,, Usually, you define an array. For example:\n\nDim Customers(1 To 100) As CustomerData\nEach of the 100 elements in this array consists of four components (as specified by the user-defined data type, CustomerData).\nYou can refer to a particular component of the record as follows:\n\nCustomers(1).Company = \u201cAce Tools\u201d\nCustomers(1).Contact = \u201cTim Roberts\u201d\nCustomers(1).RegionCode = 1\nCustomers(1).Sales = 150000.00\n\n\nYou can also work with an element in the array as a whole. For example, to copy the information from Customers(1) to Customers(2), use this instruction:\n\nCustomers(2) = Customers(1)\n\n\nThe preceding example is equivalent to the following instruction block:\n\nCustomers(2).Company = Customers(1).Company\nCustomers(2).Contact = Customers(1).Contact\nCustomers(2).RegionCode = Customers(1).RegionCode\nCustomers(2).Sales = Customers(1).Sales\n\n\n\n, You refer to a specific element in the array by using the array name and an index number. For example, you can define an array of 12 string variables so that each variable corresponds to the name of a month. If you name the array MonthNaming, you can refer to the first element of the array as MonthNaming(0), the second element as MonthNaming(1), and so on, up to MonthNaming(11)., You can also specify the number of elements in the array. You do so by specifying the first index number, the keyword To, and the last index number \u2014 all inside parentheses.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s how to declare an array comprising exactly 100 integers:\\\n\nDim TheArray(1 To 100) As Integer\n\n\n\n,\n\nTherefore, the two statements that follow have the same effect:\n\nDim TheArray(0 to 100) As Integer\nDim TheArray(100) As Integer\nIn both cases, the array consists of 101 elements.\n\n\n\n, If you would like VBA to assume that 1 is the lower index for all arrays that declare only the upper index, include the following statement before any procedures in your module: Option Base 1, VBA arrays can have up to 60 dimensions, although you\u2019ll rarely need more than three dimensions (a 3-D array).\nThe following statement declares a 100-integer array with two dimensions (2-D):\n\nDim TheArray(1 To 10, 1 To 10) As Integer\nYou can think of the preceding array as occupying a 10-x-10 matrix. To refer to a specific element in a 2-D array, you need to specify two index numbers. For example, here\u2019s how you can assign a value to an element in the preceding array:\nTheArray(3, 4) = 125\n\n\n\n,, A dynamic array doesn\u2019t have a preset number of elements.\n\nDim TheArray() As Integer\nBefore you can use a dynamic array in your code, however, you must use the ReDim statement to tell VBA how many elements are in the array. You can use a variable to assign the number of elements in an array.\nOften the value of the variable isn\u2019t known until the procedure is executing. For example, if the variable x contains a number, you can define the array\u2019s size by using this statement:\n\nReDim TheArray (1 to x)\n\n\nYou can use the ReDim statement any number of times, changing the array\u2019s size as often as you need to. When you change an array\u2019s dimensions the existing values are destroyed. If you want to preserve the existing values, use ReDim Preserve. For example:\n\nReDim Preserve TheArray (1 to z)\n\n\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":959}

{"text":" These stages could more accurately be described as cycles. You may skip stages, never experience other stages, and you can find yourself stuck in stages. But you may experience some or all stages in waves repeatedly. These stages are:Denial and isolation: This stage involves denying the reality of the situation. It is a natural response to overwhelming pain caused by grief.\nAnger: This stage emerges once the denied pain starts to surface. Anger can be aimed at inanimate objects, strangers, family or friends. You may feel angry at the person who died or left, and then you may feel guilty for feeling angry.\nBargaining: In this stage, you may feel like you need to regain control from feeling helpless. You might worry about how you should have been a better person, or you should have gotten help sooner, and so on.\nDepression: This stage brings sadness and regret that comes with the realization that the loved one is truly gone. You may feel overwhelming sadness, crying, and so on.\nAcceptance: This stage may be characterized by reaching a state of calm and withdrawal. Some people may never reach this stage of grief.;\n, The relationship has, in fact, died. Therefore, it is okay to feel as though someone precious has died. You are entitled to feel your loss. Ride the waves of grief without getting pulled under or lost in them. Don\u2019t fight them. Recognize them for what they are: waves of emotion that will take you through some strange currents for a season all the while giving your heart space to heal. Grief is part of healing.\n\n\nEven if no one else in your life knows what you are experiencing, you can still acknowledge your own pain to yourself. When you feel down, take a moment and say, \u201cI\u2019m sad, and it\u2019s okay. It gets better.\u201d\n\n, While those around you may not understand the depth of what you are feeling, don\u2019t be afraid to share your grief with a couple of people you know you can trust.\n\n, If you are concerned that you may be grieving unhealthily or that you are depressed, you may want to seek professional help. A therapist can help you understand your grief and whether you are becoming depressed.\n\n\nRead \u201cHow to Get Rid of Depression\u201d to better understand depression.\nIt can be useful to talk with a therapist even if you\u2019re not depressed. A therapist can help you understand how to work through your grief.\n\n, The old adage \u201ctime heals all wounds\u201d is true.However, healing is promoted by realistically facing the emotion and giving yourself time to recover. We may want a quick fix, but ultimately quick fixes don\u2019t exist where real love did. Accept the healing time offers and commit to not rushing yourself.\n\n, Tackle that mountain of time in small bites. You can push the pause button on planning long-term goals. This is truly a time for one day at a time.\n\n, You may still feel pain, but you may soon notice that it is less intense. Recognize the monumental step of healing for what it is. It\u2019s a promise of better days.\n\n, Find the balance that is healthiest for you of allowing sad moments while letting in new happy ones. When a wave of negative emotion hits, give yourself a moment (literally maybe just a single minute) to feel what you feel. Then, choose to move your thoughts on to something more positive.\n\n\nFor the record, it\u2019s okay to laugh when grieving. Your emotions are merely recalibrating. Believe it or not, your emotions are doing exactly what they should be doing. That said, sometimes the recalibration process hits a snag and we may find ourselves dealing with depression, which is a serious matter.\n\n, Once you get over the initial grief of losing this person, it is a good time for a truthful look at your former relationship. Start by recognizing what existed. If you have lost the loved one because of death and are trying to move forward with your life, you may discover that you have idealized your relationship with your loved one, overlooking the times that weren\u2019t so great in favor of the times that were. You are not dishonoring your loved one by recalling these less than ideal times. You are, instead, remembering the real and true person. If love existed between you, then part of what made the love so special was all of the in-between moments, and the ways you were able to work through differences.\n\n\nDon\u2019t place this person unnecessarily on a pedestal in death. Holding him up so high can keep you from holding him close in your heart and moving forward, which is not what he wanted for you.\nIf, your loss was relational rather than from someone passing, the same applies. Your relationship was not perfect. If it had been, you wouldn\u2019t be trying to move on. Even if they were the one to cut things off, it still reveals some frailty to the relationship, and that is okay.\n\n, Your relationship, like most, probably had a series of high and low moments. If you were not the one to end the relationship, you may find yourself idolizing it a bit. It is okay to look back and remember the good times. But it\u2019s important to be realistic. There were not-so-good times as well.\n\n\nAppreciate the positive aspects of the relationship, and how the other person contributed to who you are now.\n\n, It\u2019s important to acknowledge the characteristics of the relationship that brought out the worst of you. This doesn\u2019t mean that the other person was bad. But it can show you that there were some toxic elements when you were together.\n\n\nOnce you have recognized these toxic elements, you can appreciate the chance to \u201cdetoxify\u201d a bit. This will give you a chance to work on avoiding those pitfalls in other relationships. It will also help reframe your perspective of what you have lost. It helps you to give it a proper place in your thinking so you are free to move on.\n\n, Being honest about the relationship and the other person is important in reconciling your current emotions and your attempt to let go and move on. But it is important to avoid vilifying the other person, even if he treated you poorly. Too much dwelling on the past can be harmful.Assigning negative connotations or dwelling on particularly darker moments can strengthen emotional ties to the thoughts of that person, making them hard to let go. In fact, your love can turn to resentment. This doesn\u2019t free the person from your heart. It only frees him from your kindness. You deserve to be totally free to move on, so be cautious about giving him even the negative pieces of your heart.\n\n, Isolation is normal and okay for a short time. But it is vital that you don\u2019t isolate yourself from your closest supports for more than a short time. They love you and need to know you are alright. They know you better than you do yourself at times. They can help you get back to who you are at your best.\n\n\nThese are the people who know how to be silent with you and know when to push you to step out and have fun. They know how to make you laugh, and they are supportive when you need to cry. You don\u2019t have to let everyone in, but trust those closest to you.\nThese people can also help you recognize if your grief goes into depression and if you need professional supports.\n\n, Your friends and family might tread over the topic of the other person without realizing how much you are struggling. It is okay to let friends know when you need a change of subject. Just be honest and let them know that you need time. Be specific about what hurts you and what you would like to avoid for the time being., It\u2019s important to know your pain threshold and protect yourself. Perhaps you agreed to be friends with your former loved one, but the \u201cfriendly\u201d phone calls are painful. Be honest about how you\u2019re feeling. You may need to totally separate while you give yourself time to heal.\n\n, Most likely you have coworkers, classmates, or even friends and family who are just outside of the \u201cclose supports\u201d category. They may not be the ones you spill your guts to, but they still play a part in your life. It is perfectly fine to turn down your coworker\u2019s invitation to lunch for a spell, but then it will be time to let these people be the lighthearted, friendly, distraction-from-life they were before.\n\n\nThese supports generally come with natural boundaries you have already established. You tend to avoid deeply personal conversation, and keep things fun and on the surface. They won\u2019t expect you to trudge into emotional trenches over your 30-minute lunch break.\n\n, This isn\u2019t about replacing what was lost. Rather, it\u2019s about moving on. Once you find yourself dealing less and less with your grief, you find your mind less preoccupied with the person you\u2019re letting go of. Now it is time to be open to new people. New people are exciting.You do not, under any circumstances, have to get out there and date in order to move on. In fact, even thinking that way may terrify you at the moment. So let\u2019s dial back the intensity and reframe this in a comfortable way. Instead of diving into the dating scene, dive into the possibility of new friendships. Friendships can take on so many wonderful forms. Some friends are more like family. Sometimes friends move past friendship and become romantic partners. Sometimes friends simply remain friends. Regardless of where a new friend fits, you can\u2019t go wrong by being open to having more of them.\n\n, Emotions can overwhelm and even silence a person. It is time to find your voice. Talk things over with a family member, friend, counselor or minister.\n\n\nThere are times when something is so personal that it can be hard to open up to those who know us. You may consider making an appointment with a counselor or clergy member. Feelings have a way of jumbling up, making them difficult to articulate. An objective third party individual can help by asking you the right questions to untangle your emotions without inserting their own opinions.\nThe important part here is to simply start talking, rather than getting stuck in your own head where there is no one to help validate or correct your thoughts.\n\n, Write a letter to your loved one. Then, let it go to signify your own mental choice to let him go. Some people find it cathartic to burn their letter, signifying a definitive end. Or you may prefer something more considerate of the place this person will always hold in your heart. This may be more appropriate if you are letting go because this person has passed.\n\n\nYou might prefer placing your message in a helium filled balloon and setting it free.\nAnother option is creating a sky lantern with words of love written on it and sending it off as though mailing your loved one.\n\n, You may also choose to journal your feelings. Give space to the feelings you feel now, as well as the ones you hope to restore.Journaling allows you to be completely honest with yourself because your words are for your eyes only.\n\n\nThis practice also helps you to identify patterns in your thinking, your actions and behavior.\n\n, Changing even the slightest thing in your life can help you feel refreshed and remind you that life is still fun. Rearrange your furniture. Try a new haircut. Drive a different way to work. Eat dessert first. Whatever you choose to change, no matter how small, pick something enjoyable. It may only be a temporary mood lifter, but that may be all you need to remind yourself that you can still smile and enjoy life.\n\n, You\u2019ve grieved and you\u2019ve used your time to honestly consider the relationship. You have learned to honor your emotional limits as well as to challenge them. You have begun to let people in and you have found your voice. Now it is time to move on. Honor your loved one\u2019s life by living your own. His love impacted you because of how he lived, not how he died. Continue his legacy of love and live by giving yourself to the paths of love and life in front of you.\n\n\nToo often, people allow their grief to drain them of the best characteristics they shared with the one who passed. Instead, let their love with you continue on by allowing them a happy place in your memories. Learn to smile again and laugh again when recalling your loved one. They can continue to bring you joy in those memories. Humor heals., While it is important to give yourself time to heal from the broken relationship, at some point you will feel ready to let someone else in. However, you don\u2019t want to be the one carrying old baggage into a new relationship, whether the relationship is friendship or romantic. Think about whether you are free from thoughts about this former love. If you still think of him even a couple of times a day, then you could still find yourself in a rebound relationship. Even rebound friendships can be a problem because you are experiencing a temporary gap in your emotional needs and may be gravitating to someone who fills that need. But this relationship will not likely be a good overall fit. In fact, he truly may have nothing else to offer you.\n\n, Are you able to go to places you used to frequent with your former love and not immediately think of him? If your world still screams his name, then you probably need more time.\n\n, Until you are ready, it is okay to avoid places that still sting of the person you are learning to let go of. But keep in mind that pain is layered. While avoidance is okay in the beginning, eventually you\u2019ll want to challenge yourself to heal completely. Consider revisiting old venues with a trusted friend. Then you can start to create new memories and associations. Start with where you are comfortable, and slowly begin to rewrite your own memories and stories. Those places can still be special.\n\n\nWhen that one song comes on the radio, do you still think of that person? If so, it may be too early to move on. You may need to reclaim that memory by tying it to new experiences. Try sharing the song with your friends and ask them to help you give it new meaning. Make it funny. Remember, humor heals.\nIf you love the view from a certain restaurant, then meet a few of your best friends there. Laugh, enjoy yourself and start connecting that place to joy again. Peel back the layers bit by bit, and give them new and positive meanings in your life.\n\n, When someone says your former loved one\u2019s name, do you still feel a stab of pain? When you notice that feeling of pain, remind yourself that you wish him well. It may seem silly, but this can help reprogram your automatic thoughts about that person.\n\n, If you were to run into your former love with his new love, how strong would your emotional reaction be? Would seeing him happy feel hurtful for you? Are you free to be happy for him? Have you let him go?\n\n\nA little bruising is to be expected, and like a physical wound, you may be healed, fully functional and ready to get back out there. Just make sure it\u2019s no more than a little bruise before you do.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":961}

{"text":" Turkeys come in various sizes, so you will want to pick a turkey whose size can feed the number of people you plan to serve.\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is to buy 1 pound of turkey for every person you plan to serve. However, this does not allow for leftovers. If you would like to have leftovers, then you should plan to buy 1 \u00bd pounds of turkey per person.For example, if you want to serve eight people without leftovers, then you should buy an 8-pound turkey. However, if you want to have leftovers after serving those eight people, then you should buy a 12-pound turkey.;\n, It is important to avoid contaminating the turkey, so before beginning to gut it, you should be sure to thoroughly clean your work space.\n\n\nUse an antibacterial cleaning agent to wipe down the counter, and be sure that any other tools you plan to use, such as a cutting board and knives, are also cleaned with antibacterial dish washing liquid. Alternatively, you can wash down these surfaces and tools with hot, soapy water.Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds prior to handling the turkey. Also be sure to wash under your fingernails, if necessary.\n\n, Make sure that you have all necessary materials that you will need for gutting the turkey either on your person or within reach.\n\n\nCutting board\nKnife or knives\nBowls\nGloves (note: latex-free gloves would be a good option, due to latex allergies in some people)\nApron\n\n,\n\n\nThis step is only necessary if your turkey still has the neck. If it does not, you can skip this step and move onto the next.\n\n, Do this carefully, since you have already made one cut in the turkey. Flipping the turkey over prepares you to make the cuts that will enable you to pull out all of the innards safely.\n\n,\n\n\nTake care while making this cut so that you do not puncture any of the innards.,\n\n\nSome organs will be able to be kept and cooked as offal, which is highly nutritious. These include the heart, liver, and gizzard.Other organs will have to be disposed of in a proper way.\n\n, This loosens the intestine so that you can pull it out, along with the other digestive organs.You need to take care while doing making this cut because the digestive juices inside these organs will break down any meat on the turkey if they touch it.\nThese are not organs that can be kept to cook, so set them aside in their own bowl to await proper disposal after you finish gutting the turkey.\n\n, Again, this step is only necessary if your turkey has a neck.\n\n\nYou can pull out these parts through the pelvis, since they are loosened from the neck.Alternatively, you can pull these parts directly from the neck after you have made a slit., The crop refers to the sac in the turkey's breast that stores the food it was eating.A store-bought turkey likely no longer has its crop, but it would be worthwhile to verify.\n\n\nCut a slit in the turkey where the neck meets the chest and carefully pull it apart. Inside, you should see the crop. Clean it out completely., Be sure to use strong water pressure to rinse the turkey well, inside and out.\n\n\nIt is important to remove any remaining blood and lung tissue before preparing the turkey for cooking.Use cool water in order to avoid bacteria growth, which will happen with heat.\n\n,, Seal your turkey in a turkey roasting bag or a shrink wrap bag in order to store it.Only keep it in the refrigerator for a day or two before cooking; if it will be weeks or months before you plan to cook it, it should be stored in the freezer until you are ready.\n\n, You must again use antibacterial cleaning agents or hot, soapy water to clean all of your work space and tools, such as the knives and bowls. Wash your hands with warm, soapy water again to rid them of any bacteria.\n\n, When you gutted the turkey, you set aside its innards in different bowls based on whether they could be cooked later or needed to be disposed of.\n\n\nGizzard\nHeart\nLiver\nNeck, if you have it on your turkey, can also be cooked and served., Depending on how quickly you plan to cook and serve the giblets, the freezer is likely the better option.If you plan to cook the giblets within a day or two, then wrap them securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the refrigerator until you cook them.\nIf you want to save them longer term, wrap them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store them in the freezer. It is also a good idea to put them inside a freezer-safe bag for extra protection, up to four months.\nBe sure to get these items into the freezer before the \u201cbest by\u201d date on the turkey's wrapping.\n\n, If you have a cat or dog all parts of the turkey that you won't use can be fed to them, or you can give them to your pet owning neighbor.\n\n\nOtherwise, place the remaining innards in a trash bag for disposal. It would be best to double-bag these parts in order to prevent leakage if the first bag rips. You should include all of the innards that you are not keeping to cook later, such as the lungs, intestines, and gallbladder.\nIf your community has a green bin program, put them in one of the disposable bags and keep it in the freezer until trash collection day, and then put it in the green bin or if not available dispose of the innards in a dumpster or outdoor trash can. The innards will likely start to smell foul, so it is best to take them directly to a dumpster, if possible, or to throw them away in an outdoor trash can that has a lid.\nNote that wild animals, like raccoons or bears, might try to get into the trash if they can smell the innards and other waste. Secure your outdoor trash can, if possible, so that they do not make a mess by spilling it.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":964}

{"text":" There are variety of different accordions out there, but some are more well-suited for beginners than others. The more information you gather the better equipped you will be to successfully learn to play the accordion. Here is the most suitable option for beginners:\n\n\nPiano Accordions. These are the most popular kinds, with the power of a regular piano in a highly portable size. They have between 25 and 45 piano style treble keys on the right hand. On the left, they are equipped with a bass-chord keyboard. This accordion system is called the stradella, and typically has 120 brass buttons.;\n, Your accordion is composed of several parts, all crucial to the accordion's sounds:\n\n\nMelody Keys. These are buttons on the keyboard part of the instrument.\nBellows. These are the folds on the instrument that allow it to expand and contract.\nHarmonic, Base, Air Valve. These buttons provide air to escape, adjusting the tone of sound.\nRight Hand Strap. This is the main strap of the instrument that allows you to secure it onto your chest.\n\n, Children and teens or adults will need to start off with different sizes due to the difference in hand and general body size.\n\n\nChildren should start with the lowest number of bass buttons, 12 bass and 25 treble keys.\nTeens and adults should start with a 48 bass accordion. This amounts to 48 bass and 26 treble keys.\nThe 48 bass Piano Accordion is very light weight, and easy to use and handle. Plus, you can play lots of different music on it, which will make you want to hang on to it even if you outgrow it.\n\n, When you begin handling your instrument in the next section of the article, your left arm will move horizontally and vertically, while your right hand will only move vertically. For now, just hold it and see how comfortable or uncomfortable it is.\n\n, Some people prefer to stand while playing and others like to sit with their instrument. All that matters is your sense of comfort and confidence, so try out a few different positions until you feel at ease.\n\n, Your body posture is very important when playing this instrument and slouching will cause you to be inaccurate in your balance and consequently in your performance.\n\n, The accordion is relatively large and requires a little bit of familiarity when holding it. Being able to maintain proper balance is crucial. The more evenly balanced you manage to keep the accordion's weight, the better you'll be able to play because of the added control. And the more control you have, the less uncomfortable the weight will feel.\n\n, Slip your left arm under the strap of the instrument. You'll want to hold it as if you were putting on a backpack on your chest. The piano keys should be to your right and your left hand goes underneath the bass strap - the small strap on the left side of the instrument.\n\n\nNote that there is usually a thumb wheel on the left side to adjust the strap.\nMake sure that your accordion fits tightly enough not to move at all while you move.\n\n, An additional strap can be very useful. The back strap keeps the shoulder straps together so that the accordion doesn't move.\n\n\nNote that if the back strap is too far down it alleviates weight from the shoulders, making the straps loose on top. This, in turn, causes your straps to move and slide.\nKeep the back strap higher up, or secure it diagonally.\nRemember that when the straps stay in place, so does your instrument.\n\n, The buckles can be found on the top and bottom of the instrument. Take care not to push or pull the accordion yet.\n\n, Don't bend your right wrist while keeping your elbow close to your side. It'll be a bit awkward at the beginning but you'll be able to achieve better accuracy as your hand's circulation won't be impeded.\n\n\nThis applies the right arm only.\n\n, You right hand should be free and resting above the piano keyboard.\n\n, Press the button down softly, and pull your instrument with your left arm. You'll hear a hissing noise as the air goes into the accordion and the bellows open.\n\n\nNote that it's important to use this button when you open and close the bellows while they're moving.\nDon't press down on the keyboard while you're opening and closing the bellows.\n\n, No matter how many bass buttons your accordion has, you'll soon notice that they produce the chords, or vamps, automatically. This is due to the accordion's mechanism.\n\n\nThe term chord refers to the sound produced by a group of notes played together.\nKeep the bass buttons pressed for only a short time. Imagine they were on fire, and take your finger off quickly.\n\n, This will be quite difficult at first, but do your best not to look at where your fingers go, or need to go.\n\n, If your accordion is a larger model, then look for the note C in the second row.\n\n, For now, your only concern should be getting comfortable with your instrument, and focusing on the first two rows of bass buttons.\n\n\nRegardless of how many bass rows your accordion has, you'll only be looking at the first two rows.\n\n, Then, tuck your thumb under your index finger and push on the button right below the note C. This button will be slightly off center, but right below the button that your index finger is pressing.\n\n, Then, press the two buttons alternately to produce a chord. You'll generate a sort of of oom-pah sound.\n\n\nTry to pull the bellows smoothly for the best sound effect.\n\n, The beat for the Waltz goes 1, 2, 3--1, 2, 3. Play the C note on the the first beat, and push the button right below the C on the second and third beat.\n\n, This is how you can generate a simply accompaniment, or vamp.\n\n, Now try to pull the bellows in as you alternately press the four buttons you just learned. Repeat this several times to practice.\n\n, Let's try another easy scale exercise that will help you produce your first, controlled sound sequence:\n\n\nExpand the instrument's bellows.\nSoftly and evenly push it back together, and hold the 1st key down.\nKeep pressing the note key while you change directions by pulling the instrument in opposite directions.\nGo to the next key, push in and pull apart.\nJump to the next key, and you have now played Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La.\n\n, This exercise has two chords, and you can leave your fingers on the keyboard. Place your thumb on the C, and pinky on the G: begin with the third finger on the E.\n\n, Coordination might seem a little difficult at first, so it's important that you become very familiar with the necessary movements. Repeat the above exercise until you feel confident and can move on to more advanced practices.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":966}

{"text":" You will most likely need it to disassemble and reassemble various parts. Also verify that your model is equipped with a timing chain and not a timing belt. These two parts perform the same task, but replacing them can be quite different. This procedure is only for replacing a timing chain.;\n, Having your engine clean allows you to better locate any leaks or worn parts. It also makes the job less messy overall. Never clean or work on your engine while it is hot.Keep in mind that the degreaser and oils you are washing off of your engine can kill your grass and pose an environmental threat. This should be done somewhere that is properly set up to drain and filter the chemicals used., This may be stamped directly on the engine (either on the cylinder head, valve covers, or intake manifold) and sometimes listed in the owner\u2019s manual specifications.You can also use a service manual to determine firing order.This will be necessary to know because later you will need to check your number one cylinder (the one that fires first in the firing order).\n\n, You should not work on your engine with the battery plugged in. First remove the ground cable (negative terminal) and then remove the positive terminal.\n\n, This will allow the coolant to be drained from the system.\n\n, The drain cock is located near the bottom of the radiator and is a plastic screw or pull cap that you can release. Engine coolant is a mix of water and antifreeze. It is very toxic and should be stored in a plastic container with a screw-on cap. An old antifreeze bottle is ideal., Trace the radiator hoses from the radiator back to the engine. Squeeze the hose clamps with pliers and slide them back onto the hose. Wiggle the hose to break it free and move it out of the way.\n\n\nThere is no need to remove the radiator. The hoses need to be loosened and the coolant drained for the purpose of removing the water pump in a later step.\n\n, This can usually be found posted underneath the hood of your car or in your service manual for serpentine belts (S-belts). If you drive a much older car, you may have a multi-belt design (V-belt). Either way, if you cannot find a routing diagram you should take a picture or draw one before removing the belt(s).\n\n, For serpentine belts this is done by compressing the spring loaded tensioner. Some tensioners can be compressed with simple hand tools such as a wrench, and others may require a special tool. V-belts can be removed by adjusting the position of one of their pulleys to release tension.\n\n, Once tension is released, the belt should slide off of the other pulleys easily.\n\n, If your model has heater hoses attached to the water pump, loosen the hose clamps with a screwdriver and slide them back onto the hose.Wiggle the hose and pull it off of the water pump.\n\n, Take out any bolts that hold the water pump to the engine. Usually there are three to five bolts to remove. Once the bolts are removed, you should be able to pull the pump off with your hands., Remove the bolt and washer in the center of the pulley. Put the bolt partially back in the bolt hole and use a harmonic balancer removal tool. The tool should not be a jaw type tool, but instead should apply all of the removal force to the center of the assembly. This protects the rubber ring in the harmonic balancer., Unbolt the timing chain cover from the engine block. Note that the bolts are different lengths so have a system in place to remember which bolt goes where when you put the cover back on. One good method is to put them back into their proper holes in the timing chain cover and set it off to the side.\n\n, These gears are connected by the timing chain so that the position of the piston (connected to the crankshaft) correlates directly to the opening of the fuel and exhaust valves (operated by the camshaft) to keep your engine running smoothly. These gears should each be marked to help you reference their relative position.\n\n, These links are brighter than the other links and are used to align your engine.\n\n, To get your engine to top dead center, line the bright links on the timing chain up with the marks on your camshaft and crankshaft gears.Remember that the crankshaft can be set to top dead center both on the compression and exhaust strokes of the piston.You want top dead center for the compression stroke, so you can insert\n\n, This can be done by loosening the tension gear with a wrench or ratchet. Next slide the chain off of the gears.\n\n, Using a little gear oil now will help to ensure that your chain and gear perform optimally for as long as possible.\n\n, You want the bright links on the new chain to line up exactly with the marks on the gears just like the old chain did. This will allow you to locate top dead center if you ever need to.\n\n, Some chains are tensioned by adjusting either the crankshaft gear or the camshaft gear, while others have an automatic tensioner. This will vary by make and model of your car. The important thing is to make sure that your timing belt is as tight as it should be.\n\n, This is the rubber seal around the crankshaft and the timing cover.\n\n, The seal should be seated into the correct place on the timing cover. It will seal when the cover is bolted onto the engine.\n\n, It is necessary to coat the seal with oil to ensure proper functioning when the seal is compressed., The bolts are varying lengths. Remember the system you set up to keep track of which bolts went where and be sure to use the proper bolt in the proper location.\n\n, There is only the one bolt in the center that fastens the harmonic balancer into place. Check you owner\u2019s manual or service guide for proper torque specifications.\n\n, Replace the bolts that fasten the water pump to the engine block.\n\n, If you removed heater hoses from your water pump, you will need to slide them back onto the water pump. Once the hose is on the pump you can squeeze down the hose clamp with pliers and slide it up over where the hose and pump connect. If the clamp has a tightening screw, tighten it with a screwdriver. This will secure the hose to the pump.\n\n, If the lower radiator hose is still removed or if you removed the upper hose for any reason, put them back on the radiator now. Once the hose has been slid onto the radiator, use a pair of pliers to move the clamps up the hose to the place where the hose and the radiator meet. This will fasten the hose to the radiator.\n\n, If your coolant looks dirty or if it has been more than a year since you last changed the coolant in your vehicle, use new coolant. Dilute the coolant as specified in your owner\u2019s manual or service guide and fill to the mark that says \u201ccool\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d on the tank. If your coolant is clean and relatively new, you can pour the old coolant back into your radiator.\n\n, You should use the routing diagram stamped on your hood or printed in your owner\u2019s manual to make sure that the belt is run properly. Pulleys with grooves are intended to meet the grooved side of the belt, but some flat pulleys are meant to be driven by the flat backside of the belt., This can be done by releasing the tensioner in a serpentine design. If you are working with a V-belt design then you will need to tension the belt manually. A good rule of thumb is that the belt should have a maximum of 1\u20442 inch (1.3\u00a0cm) of movement in the middle of the belt's longest run.Check your vehicle manual for more information. If in doubt, consult a mechanic.\n\n, You do not want to start your engine without all of the appropriate accessories hooked up. Take a second look over everything and make sure that all is well before moving on.\n\n, Connect the positive cable first, and then connect the ground cable.\n\n, Turn the key and start the engine.\n\n, Look under your hood and under your car to make sure that no fluid is dripping or leaking. If you are leaking coolant, check to make sure all hoses are connected properly to the radiator and water pump. If you are leaking oil you might have to replace the crankshaft seal again.\n\n, This ensures that all cylinders are firing at the correct time and that the valves are opening and closing properly in relation to the piston\u2019s position.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":968}
{"text":" An electric arc is formed at the tip of the welding rod when a current passes across an air gap and continues through the grounded metal which is being welded. Here are some of the terms and their descriptions used in this article:\n\n\nWelding machine. This is the term used to describe the machine which converts 120-240 volt AC electricity to welding voltage, typically 40-70 volts AC, but also a range of DC voltages. It generally consists of a large, heavy transformer, a voltage regulator circuit, an internal cooling fan, and an amperage range selector.The term welder applies to the person doing the welding. A welding machine requires a welder to operate it.\nLeads, or Welding leads. These are the insulated copper conductors which carry the high amperage, low voltage electricity to the work piece that is being welded.\nRod holder, or stinger is the device on the end of the lead that holds the electrode, which the person welding uses to accomplish the welding task.\nGround and ground clamp. This is the lead that grounds, or completes the electrical circuit, and specifically, the clamp that is attached to the work to allow the electricity to pass through the metal being welded.\nAmperage, or amps. This is an electrical term, used to describe the electrical current supplied to the electrode.\nDC and reverse polarity. This is a different configuration used in welding with an arc\/electrode system, which offers more versatility, especially in overhead welding applications and for use welding certain alloys that do not weld easily with AC voltages. The welding machine that produces this current has a rectifier circuit or has the current supplied by a generator, and is much more expensive than a typical AC welder.\nElectrodes. There are many specialized welding electrodes, used for specific alloys and types of metals, such as cast or malleable iron, stainless or chromoly steel, aluminum, and tempered or high carbon steels. A typical electrode consists of the wire rod in the center covered with a special coating (flux)which burns as the arc is maintained, consuming oxygen and producing carbon dioxide in the weld area to prevent the base metal from oxidizing or burning away in the arc flame during the welding process. Here are some common electrodes and their uses:\n\nE6011 electrodes are a mild steel electrode with a cellulose fiber coating. The first two numbers in the electrode identification is the tensile strength, measured in pounds per square inch times 1,000. Here, the yield of the electrode would be 60,000 PSI.\nE6010 electrodes are a reverse polarity electrode, commonly used for welding steam and water pipes, and are particularly useful for overhead welding, since the metal holds its position while in a liquid state, being drawn into the molten weld pool by the flow of the direct current from the electrode to the workpiece.\nOther specific purpose E60XX electrodes are available, but since E6011s are considered a standard, general purpose rod, and E6010s are considered the standard for reverse polarity DC welding, they will not be covered in detail in this article.\nE7018 electrodes are low hydrogenflux coated steel rods, with a high yield tensile strength of 70,000 PSI. These are often used in assembling structural steel used in the construction industry, and in other applications where a strong filler material and higher strength weld is required. Note that, although these rods provide greater strength, they are less forgiving in respect to achieving a clean, high-grade weld at incorrect amperages and with dirty (rusted, painted, or galvanized) steels. These electrodes are called low hydrogen due to every attempt to lower the hydrogen content. These electrodes must be stored in an oven with a temperature between 250\u00baF and 300\u00baF. This temperature is above the water boiling point of 212\u00baF at sea level. This temperature keeps the moisture (dew)(H2O) in the air from collecting in the flux.\nNickel, Castalloy, Ni-Rod electrodes. These are special rods made for welding cast, ductile, or malleable iron, and have more yield, to allow for the expansion and contraction of the iron material being welded.\nDissimilar metals rods. These rods are made from a special alloy and give better results when welding tempered, hardened or alloyed steels.\nAluminum rods. These are a more recent technology and allow arc welding aluminum with a conventional welder, rather than using a special gas-shielded wire feed welder like a MIG (metal, inert gas) or TIG (tungsten, inert gas) welding machine, often referred to as heliarc welding, since helium was the gas used to shield the arc flame while welding. The official names created by the American Welding Society (AWS)for this arc type welding are Shielded Metal Arc Welding (stick), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (tig)and Gas Metal Arc Welding (mig).\nElectrode sizes. Electrodes come in a variety of sizes, measured by the diameter of the metal center of each rod. For mild steel rods, a diameter range of 1\u204416 inch (0.2\u00a0cm) to 3\u20448 inch (1.0\u00a0cm) is available, and the size used is determined by the amperage of the welder, and the thickness of the material being welded. Each rod performs best at a given amperage range. Selecting the correct amperage range for a given size rod will depend on the base material and the desired penetration, so specific amperages will only be covered for the welding described further in this article.\n\n\nSafety equipment. A critical part of welding safely is having, and knowing how to use, the correct safety equipment for the job. Here are some typical items that are required for welding safely.\n\nWelding shield (hood). This is the mask which is worn to protect the person welding from the bright flash of the arc, and from sparks being thrown during welding. Standard arc welding lenses are tinted very darkly, since exposure to the arc flash can cause flash burns to the retina of the eye. A level 10 darkness is the minimum for arc welding. Welding hoods with a flip up lens was once preferred, as the dark lens can be lifted up, and a separate clear glass lens will protect the welder from bits of slag while the weld is chipped. The newer self darkening welding shields are the most desirable welding shield now sold. These welding shield lens are very light colored for grinding and torch cutting. When an arc is struck the automatic self darkening lens will change to a preset #10 shade. Even newer on the market are the variable shade automatic self darkening lens.\nWelding gloves. These are special, insulated leather gloves that reach about 6 inches (15.2\u00a0cm) above the wrists, and protect the hands and lower arms of the welder (the person welding). They also provide limited protection from accidental shock if the person welding comes into contact with the electrode accidentally.\nWelding leathers. This is an apron like leather jacket that covers the shoulders and chest of the welder, used for overhead work where sparks might ignite the welder's clothing, or cause burns.\nWork boots. The person welding should wear at least a 6 inch (15.2\u00a0cm) lace-up type boot to prevent sparks and hot slag from burning his feet. These boots should have insulating soles made from a material which does not melt or burn easily.\n\n;\n, Welding is more than dragging a welding rod across a piece of steel and gluing it to another one. The process begins with properly fitting and securing the work pieces, or metal to be welded, together. For thicker pieces, you may want to grind a bevel so subsequent beads can be placed in the groove to fill it completely with a solid weld. Here are the basic steps for completing a simple weld.\n\n\nStrike the arc. This is the process of creating an electric arc between the electrode and the workpiece. If the electrode simply allows the current to pass directly into the grounded work piece, there will not be enough heat produced to melt and fuse metal together.\nMove the arc to create a bead. The bead is the metal from the melting electrode flowing together with molten metal from the base metal to fill the space between the pieces being joined by welding.\nShape the weld bead. This is done by weaving the arc back and forth across the weld path either in a zig zag or figure 8 motion so the metal spreads to the width that you want your finished weld bead to be.\nChip and brush the weld between passes. Each time you complete a pass, or trip from one end to the other of your weld, you need to remove the slag, or the melted electrode flux material, from the surface of the weld bead so only clean molten metal will be filling the weld on the subsequent pass.\n\n, This means the welding machine, electrodes, cables and clamps, and the metal to be welded.\n\n, For practice, a few pieces of mild steel, at least 3\u204416 inch (0.5\u00a0cm) thick will work.\n\n, If the metal consists of two pieces that are to be joined in the welding process, you may need to prep, or weld prep them, by grinding a beveled edge on the sides that are to be joined. This allows for sufficient penetration of the weld arc to melt both sides to a molten state so the filler metal bonds through the sectional thickness of the metal. At the least, you should remove any paint, grease, rust, or other contaminants so you are working with a clean pool of molten metal as you weld.\n\n, Locking type pliers, \"C\" clamps, a vice, or spring loader clamps will usually work. For special projects, you may find you will have to adapt different techniques to secure the work pieces until they are joined.\n\n, Make sure there is a clean location so that the electrical circuit can be completed with minimal resistance at the ground location. Again, rust or paint will interfere with the grounding of your work piece, making it difficult to create an arc when you begin welding.\n\n, As an example, 1\u20444 inch (0.6\u00a0cm) plate steel can be welded effectively using an E6011, 1\u20448 inch (0.3\u00a0cm) electrode, at between 80-100 amps. Place the electrode in the electrode holder (henceforth referred to as the stinger) making sure the conductive material of the stinger clamp is on the clean metal at the end of the electrode.\n\n, You should hear a humming sound from the transformer. The sound of the cooling fan running may or may not be heard. Some welding machine fans only operate when the machine requires cooling. If you do not, you may need to check the circuit that is supplying your power, and the breakers in the panel box. Welding machines require a considerable amount of power to operate, often a special circuit rated at 60 amps or more at 240 volts.\n\n, Hold your welding shield up just high enough so you can see to move the electrode to within a few inches of the workpiece, ready to flip in down to protect your eyes. You may want to practice tapping the electrode against the weld metal to get the feel of it before turning the power on, but never strike an electric arc without protecting your eyes.\n\n, Position the tip of the rod close to it, then drop the welding hood into place. You want to tap the tip of the electrode against the metal to complete the electrical circuit, then instantaneously pull it back a little bit, to create an electric arc between the electrode tip and the metal being welded. Another way to strike an arc is like striking a match. This arc gap, or airspace, creates a great deal of resistance in the electrical circuit, which is what produces the arc flame or plasma and heat needed to liquefy the electrode and the metal adjacent to the weld area.\n\n, This takes a great deal of practice, since different electrode diameters and welding amperages require a different gap between the tip of the electrode and the work piece, but if you can hold the gap steady, a continuous electric arc will occur from the electrode to the work piece. Typically, the arc gap should be no greater than the electrode diameter. Practice steadying the arc by holding the electrode about 1\/8 to 3\/16 of an inch from the work piece, then begin moving along the path you want to weld. As you move the electrode, the metal will be melting away, filling the pool of molten metal and building your weld.\n\n, When you have mastered controlling the arc, you will begin to practice laying, or building up the weld bead. This is the deposit of metal that joins the two pieces that you are welding together. The technique you use for laying your bead will depend on the width of the gap (if there is one) you are filling, and the depth you want the weld bead to penetrate. The slower you move the electrode, the deeper the weld will go into the metal work pieces, and for making a wide path, the more you zig zag or weave the electrode's tip, the wider the bead you will lay up.\n\n, If the electrode grounds to the metal and becomes stuck, jerk the stinger to break the rod free either from the stinger clamp or the weld metal. If the arc is lost because you move the electrode too far from the metal's surface, stop the process and clean the slag from the spot you are welding so when you re-strike the arc to continue, there will be no slag in the weld area to contaminate the new weld you are beginning from the place the arc was lost or broken. Never lay a new bead over existing slag, as this material will melt in the arc plasma and bubble through the new layer of metal you are placing, resulting in a weak and dirty weld.\n\n, This will allow you to fill more of the weld in a single pass, leaving a cleaner and more sound weld. The electrode is moved in a sideways motion as it is drawn along the weld path, either in a zig-zag, curved, or figure eight motion.\n\n, If you find the finished weld bead is pitted, with deep cratering at the bead's edges, or the adjacent metal is simply melted or burned away, reduce the amperage incrementally until the condition is corrected. If, on the other hand, you have difficulty striking or maintaining an arc, you may need to increase the amperage.\n\n, After you have finished welding, you may want to remove the slag and clean up your weld, either to allow paint to bond better, or simply for cosmetic reasons. Chip off the slag and wire brush the weld to remove any foreign material and remaining slag. If the surface needs to be flat to allow fitting the piece you have welded to another piece, use an angle grinder to remove the top, or high portion of the bead. A clean weld, particularly after grinding flat, is easier to examine to see if pitting, puddling, or other defects have occurred while welding.\n\n, Freshly welded metal will corrode rather quickly if exposed to the elements, since the actual base metal is exposed directly to moisture.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":969}
{"text":" Tell the store employee what kind of switch you want and how many you\u2019ll need, and they can help you determine the best purchase.\n\n\nSingle-pole switches are the simplest and most common.

Turn the screws counter-clockwise until they are freed from the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Pull the switch away from the wall to expose the wiring, but leave the wires connected. Use a circuit or voltage tester to ensure no current is flowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using a circuit tester, hold one probe of the circuit tester against the grounding wire (green or bare copper), and touch the other probe to each of the screw terminals (located along the sides of the switch).\nIf using a voltage tester, simply hold the tester near the wires.\nIf the tester registers any current, stop the project immediately until you\u2019re able to power off the circuit.\n\n, Pull the switch as far from the electrical box as the wires allow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake careful note of how the switch is wired.

{"text":" While height is just one of the factors that dictates the safety of a fall (along with falling surface and jump form) it is something you should take into consideration while you plan your jump. 10 feet can result in an injury if you fall on one foot or your spine. Falls of 30 feet or more could result in serious injuries or even death.There have been a few recorded cases of people falling thousands of feet and surviving. Don't use this as an example to go by, however. These are considered miraculous exceptions for a good reason.;\n, Softer surfaces are always preferable to hard ones, as they'll help absorb some of the shock of the land.\n\n\nGrass, sand and mud are good places to fall to. Concrete, on the other hand, is about as unforgiving as it gets.\nSurfaces with a lot of degree can pose an extra threat. Landing onto an otherwise soft area with pine needles would result in a different (but similarly intense) sort of pain.\n\n, If you have time to prepare for your jump, you should make sure to wear something on your feet that will help to cushion the force. If you're aiming for a proper landing on your feet, you run the risk of hurting them without something to ease the shock. Most sports sneakers include this technology in some form.\n\n\nShoes with a strong grip help if there's any risk of slipping during your fall.\n\n, If you get needlessly frustrated, your joints will tense up. This increases the risk of potential injury. If you've got the time to spare, try looking at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself everything will be okay.\n\n, If this is the case, you'll want to be as practical as possible. Look around you, and try to see if there are any opportunities to get yourself lower to the ground.\n\n\nHolding yourself off a ledge can get you 6 feet closer to the ground. This difference in altitude can mean a lot with regards to potential injury., It goes without saying that having a friend watching over you is more helpful if he's already got some fitness knowledge. Perhaps more importantly, the presence of someone nearby will ensure the quickest call for medical attention if you need it for whatever reason.\n\n, Even if it's not enough time to train, the act of going through a bit of a moderate workout will loosen up your joints and get your body into the proper momentum for strain.\n\n, As you're about to jump, make a point of spotting the place you would like to land. Having a specific place on the ground below you will increase your stability. If you're only aiming for a broad area, you're more likely to lose concentration.\n\n, Although you should have already warmed up by this point, you can go through a mock jump right before you make the actual leap. Many athletic jumpers use a mock run-through in the seconds before as a way to build up momentum. You should do the same as you count down to your leap. Use these final moments as an opportunity to check everything you're doing with your jump set-up.\n\n, In a jump down to a lower place, you won't want to jump much higher than you already are. Get just enough force to earn you the proper stance and momentum. Keep your elbows close to your body, and tuck your chin in close to your neck.Bend your knees and lunge forward however much you need to. All of this will minimize potential injury.\n\n\nFor the sake of keeping your body straight, keep your eyes fixed forward. This will keep your body from going imbalanced in mid-jump.\nSome people may freak out if they see themselves dropping a far-enough distance, so if you're queasy, it's best to keep your eyes off the ground.\n\n, A proper athletic jump should end in the same stance as it began. Do your best to keep your body straight. Even in freefall, it's important to keep your stance straight and stable. Letting your limbs go wild will increase the risk of injury.\n\n\nKeep your feet and knees together while you jump. This will maximize the chances of you landing on both feet.Although you'll want to keep your body from moving around excessively, you should allow room for flexibility as your body meets the landing., Giving your body the freedom to adjust as you meet the ground is essential for preventing injury.Don't lock your knees at any point, and give your muscles the limberness they'll need to counter the force of the land.\n\n\nBending the knees will reduce shock. Just make sure your legs aren't bent more than 90 degrees.Exercising with squats will help your body adjust to this change when it's needed., If your body is \"soft\" (rather than tensed), you'll be able to react naturally to a landing. This is a natural way of minimizing potential damage in a fall.With this said, it's a good idea to try to make yourself as relaxed as possible before you set into your jump.\n\n\nTry to strike a balance between going limp and holding your proper form.\n\n, Do your best to keep your legs and feet together throughout the jump. This will maximize the chances of your feet hitting the ground at the same time. Landing on both feet is more important if your jump is high enough. An imbalanced fall can result in severe injury.\n\n\nDon't try to break your fall with your hands. Hands can alleviate some of the shock on your feet, but they can generally withstand only a fraction of the pressure that feet can.When you land, try to land on the balls of your feet, shoulder-width apart.\n\n, It's not just a thing for action movies. A landing roll is arguably the best way of absorbing shock from a fall. If you're landing from a height, you should aim for a diagonal roll. Pushing yourself into a roll with one foot will avoid placing stress on your spine.As you fall, aim a shoulder to the ground in the direction you want to roll in. As you're rolling, take a foot and hit the ground with it to give you the extra force you need to complete the roll.\n\n\nRolls are difficult to master and should be left to trained athletes. It should be said as a high-difficulty alternative to landing on both feet.\nTry rolling on both sides. It's a good habit for athletic versatility, and you may find you prefer one side over the other.For practice, regular \"gymnastics rolls\" (without a jump) will get you used to the experience of rolling. They're relatively easy to do provided you have a degree of fitness and flexibility. If you want to practice with diagonal rolls, a playground (with a soft ground) is a good place to start.Rolls lead well into continued movement. This is why they're so highly recommended in sports like parkour.\n\n, They're relatively cheap and easy to do anywhere, but they target a lot of muscles that aren't typically worked out. To squat, bend your knees as low as you can while you keep your back perfectly straight. Hold your place for 30 seconds, then release and try again.\n\n\nSquats are remarkably challenging at first if you're unused to them. However, your body will train up fast.\n\n, Plyometrics refer to a series of exercises intended to balance out the use of muscles in your legs. Because people are usually sitting down in their jobs, the sedentary behaviour trains the legs to depend on knees instead of glutes. Plyometrics aims to reverse this.Make a sequence of tiny jumps, only a couple inches off the ground. Try to make your landings as quiet and soft a possible.Shift your body's weight around on your heels, keeping your knees behind your toes throughout the movement.\n\n, This is short of the recommended 7-9 hour routine. Athletes should arguably be sleeping 9-10 hours in order to accommodate for all of the wear and tear the body goes through from regular practice. If you're not giving yourself enough sleep, you're putting a major curb on your jump potential.\n\n, In the case of jumping, water is essential to keep the joints fluid and limber. Keep a refillable bottle of water whenever you're planning to train or jump. Drink it whenever you get a break.\n\n\nDon't drink so much water that you end up feeling bloated. The feeling doesn't last forever, but it is uncomfortable and limits your training for a while.\n\n, Start with small heights, and gradually work your way forward. The process may not be as glamorous as with taking the biggest jumps from the start, but it is more effective in terms of raw learning.\n\n, Even if you consider yourself properly trained at a certain point, there's a lot of value in continuing to practice. Because something like jumping depends on a lot of various factors like distance, height and weight, the particulars will be different each time you try it. Over time, you'll get a sharper understanding of how your body is best used with a jump.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":972}
{"text":" A first-degree burn is usually a thermal burn caused by contact with a hot object or environment. It may result from sun exposure (sunburn), oil splatter from a hot pan, or accidentally touching a hot oven rack. A first-degree burn is painful, and will leave a deep red color on the top layer of skin (epidermis). But despite the stinging redness, there is no blistering in a first-degree burn. The skin will remain dry and intact.First-degree burns are quite common, and very rarely require professional medical treatment.\nHealing occurs in three to five days.;\n, But the skin damage will go beyond the top layer (epidermis) down into the top of the second layer (dermis). And unlike a first-degree burn, you will see blistering in a second-degree burn. Pain and bleeding are both good signs, as they suggest that there is no significant damage to nerves or blood vessels.\n\n\nSuperficial second-degree burns usually heal without scarring within two weeks, and do not require medical attention., A superficial second-degree burn can heal on its own, but a deep second-degree burn needs to be seen by a doctor. Look for spots of pale skin interspersed between the blisters. The blisters will bleed easily and may ooze a straw-colored material. If left untreated, deep second-degree burns can become third degree burns within a few days.Always seek treatment for a second degree burn if:\n\n\nYou are not sure what level of burn you have\nHave diabetes or a compromised immune system\nWere injured by a chemical burn, especially alkaline burns like from Drano.\n\n, A first degree burn can always heal on its own at home, but large second-degree burns should be seen by a doctor. Whether superficial or deep, a second-degree burn that affects more than 10-15% of your skin needs medical attention. The doctor will both assess the burn and treat possible dehydration. You lose a lot of fluid through your damaged skin when you have large burns. Tell the doctor if you feel thirsty, weak, dizzy, or are having trouble urinating. If he suspects dehydration, your doctor may give you IV fluids., Untreated third degree burns can become septic and cause death. They are distinguished from a second-degree burn by the presence of nerve, vein, and muscle damage.\n\n\nBecause of the nerve damage, the burn site will feel numb rather than painful, though the edges may still hurt.\nSkin will both look and feel dry and thick\/leathery. You will likely experience swelling.\nRather than redness, you may see white, yellow, brown, purple, or even black skin.\nYou may feel thirsty, dizzy, or weak. Dehydration may cause trouble urinating.\n\n, However, you should consider seeing a doctor if the burn doesn\u2019t heal within several weeks, or if new, unexplained symptoms emerge. Any increase in pain, swelling, redness, or discharge that becomes unmanageable should be examined as well. Seek immediate emergency attention if you experience the following:\n\n\nBurns to the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, or major joints\nChemical or electrical burns\nThird-degree burns\nTrouble breathing or burns to the airway\n\n, Ocular chemical burns can be very serious, so you need to take immediate action. If a chemical gets into your eyes, flush your eyes with water for at least five full minutes. You should always see a doctor for examination after a potential chemical burn to the eyes. He may add a 1% calcium gluconate solution to your eye-flushing routine. The doctor can also prescribe anesthetic eye drops to control your pain.\n\n\nIf you wear contacts, remove them carefully when flushing out your eyes.\n\n, Chemicals powerful enough to burn the skin can continue to work their way into deeper layers if left untreated. Thus, all chemical burns require medical attention. However, while waiting to see the doctor, the best thing you can do is hold the burn under cool (not cold) running water or soak it in a water bath.\n\n, The first order of business in a first or superficial second-degree thermal burn is to lower the skin temperature at the burn site. Place the burned skin in cool (not cold) water for 10 minutes. If you don't want to waste running water, fill a sink or bathtub to submerge the skin. Either refill with cold water as the water warms up, or use ice cubes to keep the water temperature low.\n\n\nJust make sure that all the burned skin is either submerged in or under the flow of running cold water.\n\n, Note that many experts advise against applying ice to a burn, as the dramatic temperature change can cause frostbite.Always cool the skin in water for at least 20 minutes if you want to apply ice to it. Simply seal the ice into a Ziploc bag with some water and wrap a rag or paper towel around it to create a barrier between you skin and the extreme cold. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables out of your freezer if you don't have ice. Apply the ice for about ten minutes, rotating it around the burn site if it gets too cold.\n\n\nAlways make sure to use a cloth or paper towel barrier.\n\n, Ointments seal the burn, and may actually prevent healing if you apply them too soon. For first-degree burns, wait 24 hours before you apply any burn care or other ointments.If you are not near a medical facility and you have a second-degree burn, apply bacitracin ointment (an antibiotic) to the burn to prevent infection as you get to treatment. This is the only situation in which you should apply bacitracin to burned skin.\n\n, The pharmacy may have any of a variety of benzocaine brands such as Anacaine, Chiggerex, Mandelay, Medicone, Outgro, or Solarcaine. Furthermore, these products are available in a wide variety of applications: cream, spray, liquid, gel, ointment, or wax. Read the instructions on the package to learn the correct application method and dosage.\n\n\nMake sure not to overuse benzocaine, as it soaks into the skin more easily than some other local anesthetics.\n\n, You can relieve some of the pain from a minor burn by taking an over-the-counter pain reliever. An oral NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) such as ibuprofen or naproxen will help relieve pain and inflammation from the burn.Follow all dosing instructions on the packaging. Take the smallest dose that is effective at relieving your pain.\n\n, If cold water doesn't make the pain diminish, shaving cream is a surprisingly effective solution! Shaving creams like Barbasol contain a chemical called triethanolamine. Triethanolamine is an active ingredient in Biatine, a prescription cream used to treat even severe burns in hospital settings.Just spread it over the affected skin and leave it alone until the pain goes down.\n\n\nAvoid mentholated shaving creams, as they may cause further irritation.This should only be considered when you have a first-degree burn. Do not attempt this method with a burn that is any more severe than a sunburn.\n\n, While you may prefer the idea of home or natural remedies, many of these methods are untested, relying on anecdotal and not scientific evidence. Without medical backing, these methods can be risky and are likely not recommended by your doctor. If you wish to use a natural remedy, talk to your doctor first.\n\n\nIf you choose to utilize these methods, you must still cool and clean the burn first. You should also seek immediate medical attention for anything more severe than a first-degree or superficial second-degree burn.\n\n, The chemicals in the aloe plant's leaves do more than just minimize pain and inflammation. They actually encourage faster healing and the growth of fresh, healthy skin. Treat the burn with aloe lotion several times a day, as necessary.\n\n\nNever apply aloe products to an open wound.\nYou can use pure aloe from an aloe plant. Alternatively, look for 100% pure aloe vera gel at the store.\n\n, However, lotions with St. John's wort may be a little harder to find than aloe lotions. You can find them easily online, though, or in many health food stores.\n\n\nDo not apply St. John's wort essential oil to burns, though, as it can prevent the skin from cooling.\n\n, If you have a large burn area \u2014 from sunburn, for example \u2014 you might add a few drops of the oil to your bath and soak in it. Smaller areas may benefit from more focused treatment.\n\n\nMake sure to cool the burned skin with cold water for at least ten minutes.\nSoak a clean gauze or rag in ice-cold water.\nTo this gauze\/rag, add one drop of essential oil for every square inch of burned skin.\nApply the rag to the burned area.\n\n, Honey has antibacterial properties that promote faster healing in a wide variety of injuries.Instead of running for your pantry, though, look for medicinal grade honey for best results. It's not usually available in regular grocery stores, so look for health food stores or providers of ayurvedic medicine. You can also find medicinal grade honey easily online.\n\n\nDo not apply honey to broken skin, or burns that are worse than first-degree burns.\nThe only exception is if you are far away from a medical care facility. If you cannot get to treatment quickly, use an antibiotic ointment or honey on the burn to help prevent infection as you wait to get treatment., Simply steep one teaspoon of calendula flowers in a cup of boiling water for 15 minutes. Once it's been strained and cooled, you can either soak the burned area in it or apply a cloth soaked in the tea to the skin. If you have calendula oil instead of leaves, dilute 1\/2 to one teaspoon in 1\/4 cup of water. You may be able to find calendula creams in naturopathic stores or practices. Apply calendula four times daily until the burn has healed.\n\n\nStudies also suggest that green tea can be helpful for treating burns., Though the smell is unpleasant and it might make your eyes water, onions have been shown to sooth burns.Simply cut up some onion and gently rub it against the burn, working the juice into the wound without causing pain. Do this several times a day until the wound heals, making sure to use fresh onions every time.\n\n, When you're not using these treatments, you must protect the damaged skin from infection. Pat the burned area dry, then cover it with clean gauze. Tape or wrap it into place, then change the dressing daily until the skin appears normal. Check for signs of infection every day: fever, increased redness, and pus.If you see such symptoms, notify your doctor immediately.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":973}

{"text":" Many rope bags include a hole in the bottom: tie one end of the rope so that it will not pull through the hole. To pack up your rope, simply stuff the rope into the bag. Be sure to keep one end free so that you can easily find it when you're climbing; consider tying it to an outside strap of the sack.\n, That is, run it through your hands and stack it in an orderly pile so it's less likely to get tangled during the coiling process. Leave the bottom end of the rope sticking out from the bottom of the rope pile.\n\n,, Once your arms are spread, grasp both strands of rope in your left hand, too.\n\n, Hold one end of the rope in your dominant hand. Take your other hand, and run it along the length from your dominant hand, over your shoulder and behind your neck, and down your straight non-dominant arm. The rope should hang on your neck like a dirty, heavy scarf.\n\n, Hold onto both strands of rope with your left hand as you reach across with your right hand, grasping both strands between your left hand and the stack of rope coils. Then, take the hand opposite from the slack and grab the slack, then do the same flip over your head and onto your shoulders. Continue this way until you have the entire rope going back and forth across your shoulders and arms and looping through your hands each time.\n\n\nBe sure to leave at least two feet of slack. If you want to carry the coil as a \"rope pack\", leave five to ten feet of slack\n\n, Drape this length of rope across your shoulders, behind your neck.\n\n, Make sure you continue working with both strands at once.\n\n,, When you are almost done, and you've left 6-10 feet of slack rope, grab the entire bundle behind your neck; pull it up and over so that you have all your rope in front of you.\n\n\nPull the coils off your shoulders, holding them together so you don't drop any strands of rope.\nBring your hands together, take the two bundles of rope, and put them together in one big loop.\nYou should be holding a loose coil in one hand: an upside down U shape of all your rope with loops on the ends of the U. Hold that loop in one hand (probably your dominant one) while you bring the whole bundle back over your head.\n\n, Hold the bundle here, so each end of the coils drapes down on either side.\n\n, Wrap both ends of the rope around the bundle you made, below where your hand grips the coils, cinching each wrap tight. You should be able to just hold the whole bundle by the slack now.\n\n\nThe bottom of the coil may look a bit untidy but that doesn't matter as long as the top is tight and orderly.\n\n, Leave yourself approximately three feet of rope, and let whichever hand is holding the U-shape grab the remaining end. Let go of the bundle, and pull the end through at the same time, without letting go with the other hand. Bring the end of the rope through its own loop at the top of the bundle, creating a half hitch around the top of the bundle. Reach through the hole you left, between the \"top\" of the folded coil bundle and the wraps you just made. Grasp the trailing sections of rope near the bundle and pull them both partway through the hole, creating a loop.\n\n\nFeed the slack around the big loop a few times, bundling it all together so it looks like a really thick noose. Wrap it at least five times, but probably no more than ten. It is up to you how much you want to wrap, and if you need more room, unwind the end in the loop to give you more room.\nTake a loop of the slack and put it through the noose's loop; feed the rest of the slack through its own loop, crochet-stitch style.\n\n, Slide the loop over the top of the coiled climbing rope, so this loop lies over the other wraps you just made.

Swing the whole thing onto your back and take the two pieces of slack and put one over each shoulder, then cross them across your chest. Put them under your arms and then around the back of the coil on your back, then back out around your waist. Tie a square knot to keep the coil in place.\n\nThis is especially useful if the rope gets damp from snow. Never climb when it is raining, or has rained! Rock is more likely to break if it is wet, because it has all the extra weight from the water.\nIf you have all the gear in your pack (crampons, backup rope, shoes, anchors, belay devices, carabiners, quick-draws, and trad gear) your partner can just sling the rope on his\/her back, and off you go!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":979}

By writing without stopping, no matter what comes out, after a few minutes you will start to access new and fresh ideas that you wouldn\u2019t have thought of at first.\n\n, It requires visual organization and logical organization, which engages your whole brain and encourages creativity.\n\n\nStart with a piece of paper and pen or marker. Write down the concept you are working (for example, \u201cClothing\u201d) with in the middle of the paper and put it in a shape like a circle or square.\nDraw lines off of the center to create new shapes with related concepts. For example, you could draw a line from \u201cClothing\u201d to have a space for \u201cHats\u201d and another with a space for \u201cShirts\u201d\nDraw new lines off of these subcategories to make sub-sub-categories. For example, draw a line for \u201cFlannel\u201d off of \u201cShirts.\u201d\n\n, One way to get your creative juices flowing is to challenge accepted ways of understanding things. You can do simple exercises to practice this, as a way of getting ready to think creatively about a problem or project. For example, take an everyday object, like a paper clip, and think of ten new uses for it.Normally, a paper clip is used to fasten loose papers together. However, you could also:\n\n\nStick paperclips in the ends of corn so you can eat it off the cob\nUse a chain of paperclips as a necklace\nUse a paperclip to open a stubborn seal, such as on a medicine bottle\nUse a paperclip as an instrument to paint intricate designs on your fingernails using nail polish.\n\n, It can be used as a practice exercise to boost creativity or when you are working on a project. \u201cToppling\u201d is one technique to practice free association:Think of a word, any word, such as \u201cpotato.\u201d\nThink of another word that is related to it, but not the same kind of thing (in this case, not a vegetable). For example, \u201cchip\u201d (\u201cpotato chip\u201d).\nContinue by again making an association between the last word and a new one, such as \u201cpaint\u201d (\u201cpaint chip\u201d).\nRepeat the same step to find a new word, such as \u201cwallpaper\u201d (an alternative to paint)\nKeep repeating this procedure, always trying to find words that are related in different ways.\n\n, These require you to think about similarities between objects or concepts, often ones that are not related in an obvious way. They often take the form of \u201cX is to Y as A is to B.\u201d Start by thinking of objects, and form analogies:\n\n\n\u201cA potato is to a french fry as a tree is to a board\u201d (french fries are made from parts of potatoes; boards are made from parts of trees)\n\u201cA tree is to a forest as sand is to a desert\u201d (forests are made of lots of trees; a desert is made of lots of sand)\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":980}

Often you will see a cable running from this breaker box directly to the AC compressor.\n\n, There is a latch on the box (either on the side or bottom) that unlocks it. Once the door is in the open position, push it in slightly and it should lock in place.\n\n, Set the breaker aside in a safe place.\n\n,, Use the appropriate bit with a bit driver to remove the screws. Typically there are four 5\/16\" hex screws that attach the side panel to the rest of the unit. Place the screws in a secure location so as not to lose any.\n\n, It will have a cylindrical, canister-like shape. It will have three terminals on top. There will be colored wires coming from the AC Unit to some if not all of the terminals on the capacitor.\n\n, The top of the run capacitor should be perfectly flat. If you see that the top side is bulging upwards in any way, it needs to be replaced. If this is not the case, a faulty capacitor may not be the source of the issue. You may need to contact your local HVAC professional.\n\n\n\n\n\n, The three terminals on the capacitor are labeled HERM, FAN, and C. Take a picture with your smart phone to record how everything is installed to make sure the new capacitor is connected in the same way. Jotting down these details on a piece of paper will also work.\n\n\n\n\n\n, Inspect your insulated flat-head screwdriver. A properly insulated screw driver should have a entirely rubber handle. Ensure the handle has no exposed metal parts or cracks., To do this you are going to create a bridge between the C terminal and the HERM\/FAN terminals, one at a time, using the metal part of the screwdriver. Ensure you are not touching anything metal. With the metal part of the screwdriver, touch a metal prong on the C terminal AND another from the HERM terminal at the same time, creating a bridge between the two. This may produce a shock. Do this two more times to ensure the terminals were completely discharged. Do the same to the C and FAN terminals.\n\n\n\n\n\n, Use the appropriate bit and the bit driver to remove the screws. These are typically two 1\/4\" hex screws but this may vary. Set the screws and the bracket in a secure location.\n\n, To be safe, always treat the capacitor terminals as live terminals. Remove the old capacitor., They can be purchased at your local HVAC Supply Store or they can also be purchased online through Amazon, eBay, etc... The simplest way to make sure you buy the correct one is to order the same model number from the same manufacturer. There are occasions where another brand might be more affordable. In this case you want to make sure to match the specifications on the old capacitor.\n\n, Attach the appropriately colored wires according to how they were placed on the old capacitor.,, Plug the 220v breaker back in the ON position. Turn on the thermostat to cool. The AC unit should turn on within the next two to three minutes. Verify the unit is working properly. Do not attempt to reattached the AC unit's side panel while there is power running through it., Put the AC panel cover back on and secure it with the appropriate screws. Plug the 220v breaker back in and set the thermostat to cool. The repair is complete!","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":981}

{"text":" Afrikaans is a young Germanic language which has a much simpler grammar than English and Dutch. It is not only spoken by (77% of all) coloured and (58% of all) white people in South Africa, but also 11 different cultural groups speak Afrikaans as a home, second or third language. Today, the Flemish, Dutch, Germans, Anglophonic peoples, Swedes and even Polish and Russians are rather keen to get in touch with what is known as the simplest Germanic language in the world.;\n, Because Afrikaans sounds quite guttural, it is also the perfect language to swear in! Lots of South Africans use it for this purpose only! Which is kind of sad, but it is certainly a very expressive language in other words. However, if the user are interested in learning Dutch, Afrikaans makes an excellent basic stepping stone.\n\n, Which means \"good morning\". Nobody says that anymore. It is old-fashioned. When we greet someone we just say \"Hallo\" or \"Hi\" or something similar like \"m\u00f4re\" which means \"morning\". Afrikaans has been influenced a lot by English.\n\n, The \"Hoe\" is pronounced like \"who\" in English and means \"how\". The 'g' sound in the beginning of \"gaan\" is made in the back of the throat. That is the hardest sound in Afrikaans. In order to pronounce this letter, make like a car that suddenly hits the brakes on a gravel road. A scratchy sound, like if you've got something stuck in your throat and want to get it out. after you think you've got it try the whole word: \"gaan\". The 'aan' part is pronounced like \"on\" in English. \"gaan\" means \"goes\" and can be used in all tenses which will often require a prefix or suffix. Finally the word \"dit\" which means \"it\" in English. \"dit\" is pronounced like the first syllable in the urban word \"ditto\" so it's \"dit\"\/\/\"to\" but only the first part. Also the 'i' is pronounced \"uh\". Finally say the three words in sequence: Hoe Gaan Dit? Which if directly translated into english would basically mean \"How Goes It?\" there you have it.\n\n, The thicker the volume, the better. English-Afrikaans, Nederlands-Afrikaans (better known as ANNA) and Deutsch-Afrikaans bilingual dictionaries are already available. Trilingual dictionaries for African languages-Afrikaans are also available, though not very extensive.\n\n, It is important to know idiomatic expressions, otherwise you won\u2019t grasp the humor. Luckily though, if you know Dutch, or know a few Dutch expressions, most idiomatic expressions will be comprehensible. Also, especially nowadays, people directly translate English proverbs.\n\n, You should listen to Afrikaans more often. To give you some idea how an Afrikaans accent sounds like, visit http:\/\/af.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hoofstad on the Afrikaans Wikipedia, click on the speaker and read along . In this way, you can read and listen to the article simultaneously. As you would listen to Radio Nederland Wereldomroep just to get familiar with the Algemeenbeschaafde Dutch accent \u2013 use Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) for Afrikaans. At the homepage, place the cursor on Luister, and then Luister Weer. Click Luister Weer. You may select any program that you think you will like (e.g. Die tale wat ons praat), ignore Sleutelwoord and Datums; click on and click LAAI AF at any particular day\u2019s topic you want. After the sound file has been downloaded, you may listen for \u00b1 half an hour, at your own leisure, how Afrikaans words are pronounced. Afrikaans is a fast language, which is why you should be able to replay the podcast.\n\n, The Afrikaans community is fueled by humor. Most of it are puns (using Afrikaans idiomatic expressions and words), irony, rhyme, similes, metaphors, exaggerations, understatements and innuendos. If the Afrikaans speaking people start giggling or laughing when you speak Afrikaans, don\u2019t take it personally or seriously at all \u2013 if you are a male, your voice tone might sound rather feminine (many don\u2019t articulate deep and raspy enough from the throat, but speak softly from the front of their mouths) or very awkward. If you are female, you probably used the wrong expressions. You\u2019ll get the hang of it. Just keep on practicing.\n\n, South Africa and Namibia are sunny countries. Biometeorology and psychology has the theory that the amount of sun exposure has an influence on human behaviour. In parallel with other sunny Mediterranean South European and South American peoples, Afrikaans speaking people are much, much less reserved and much more talkative, emotional and interactive than Northern Europeans. If they are happy, shocked, sad, frustrated, passionate or overjoyed, the facial expression, voice tone, body language and hand gestures tells it all. To show emotion is not a weakness, it shows you are human \u2013 and is therefore a virtue. They\u2019re not living in the science-fiction film, Equilibrium.\n\n, When it comes to gender, Afrikaans and the Afrikaans culture (like most other African cultures) has always been patriarchal. Some argue that the Afrikaans culture is fundamentally based on religion, while others argue that the lack of First World infrastructure and education cannot sustain acculturation to First World countries; which also includes social equality. Men have their traditional gender roles, and so do women. Respect it. In modern South Africa, there are but a few Afrikaans speaking feminists who want to change the image of Afrikaans culture, though most Afrikaans speaking women (especially those inside a marriage) complain: Vandag se mans is regtig pap! Waarom moet \u2019n vrou altyd die broek in die huis dra? (Today\u2019s men are utterly sloppy and pathetic! Why should a woman always wear the trousers at home? .) Keep this in mind when speaking.\nAfrikaans doesn\u2019t have any gender for a neutral object, such as a table, ship or car; just like English. Die\/ dit is used: Die motor wil nie vat nie. Dit werk nie. .\nHowever, if a gender must be added towards, say, a ship, car or table, it is always masculine. Jy moet die tafel vernis \/ motor was \/ skip laat nasien, hy lyk verwaarloos. (You must varnish the table \/ wash the car \/ service the ship, he looks dilapidated.)\nAny animal of which the sex is unknown, is always masculine; an animal is not an \u201cit\u201d. \u201cDaardie hond daar oorkant\u2013 het hy hondsdolheid?\u201d Don\u2019t ever call someone on their first name, unless permitted to do so.\nIf a minor calls you oom or tannie , accept it with gratitude. It is a form of respect. This title is usually given to someone who is 10 years older + than they are.\nIn a business environment, the title comes first, followed by the surname. If you don\u2019t know a woman\u2019s marital status, just use dame (Madam). The register is formal at the first meeting, but may become more informal as the business partners build a better working relationship.\nImportant \u2013 Don\u2019t use jy en jou (informal you) to someone much older than you are. It is very disrespectful and the person will most likely take it as an offensive gesture, for the two of you are not from the same age group(Note1). In this case, try not to use any pronouns at all, or use u (formal you).\n(Note1) In Europe and other First World Continents, there are less youth than elderly people. Therefore age egalitarianism is being utilized (as the youth are the odd ones out). In South Africa and other Third World Countries, there are less elderly people than youth. Therefore, the hierarchal pyramid persists (as the elderly people are the odd ones out).\n\n,, In this way, you will also get in contact with the different Afrikaans dialects.\n\n,, Latinized words also sound long (having too much syllables) and dreary. Rather use short Germanic words and short sentences instead. Words that the typical man on the street will understand. For example, don\u2019t use offisieel (official) instead of amptelik, like in Afrikaans is \u2019n amptelike taal van Suid-Afrika. (Afrikaans is an official language of South Africa). For a list for some of these words, go to: http:\/\/af.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lys_van_minder_suiwer_Afrikaanse_woorde . Difficult for the English and Romance language speaker? Sure do. But wait, there\u2019s another way out\u2026\n\n, What?! Yes! After all, you\u2019re probably not going to be a news reader or television personality. Perhaps an Afrikaans rock star... Afrikaans people use English words to lubricate a sentence (make it speak more fluently and faster), or if an Afrikaans equivalent term doesn\u2019t pop up that quickly. There is a difference between formal office\/document language and the informal conversation language (diglossia). So, feel free. Most Afrikaans speakers will notice you are not familiar with their language and won\u2019t bite your head off. There are only a few cases of purists-extremists; but they are only one in every ten thousand.\n\n, If the Afrikaans speakers notice that you are struggling with Afrikaans, they will automatically switch to English (or maybe an African language you might know) \u2013 they are only trying to accommodate you. But you have to put your foot down and demand Afrikaans. Otherwise, you\u2019ll never learn through trial and error. They\u2019ll gladly help you.\n\n, A large number of lyrics of popular songs are available on the Net and some of the contemporary artists\u2019 music videos are played on YouTube. On the sites you can also search for Kurt Darren, Snotkop, Steve Hofmeyr, Juanita du Plessis, Nicholis Louw, Sorina Erasmus, Chrizaan, Bobby van Jaarsveld, Chris Chameleon, Ray Dylan, Bok van Blerk, Emo Adams, Arno Jordaan, Gerhard Steyn and Robbie Wessels, Jay, Eden etc. Some of the other modern individuals and groups are Jack Parow, Fokofpolisiekar, Die Antwoord, Die Heuwels Fantasties, Glaskas, Die Tuindwergies etc. Since the early 2000s it seems as though everyone has literally jumped on the bandwagon. Every week a new Afrikaans artist arrives on the scene; and the Afrikaans music industry caters for almost every genre, but most prominently the rock genre. The reason for this fertile ground is because Internet piracy of Afrikaans music is particularly very low, and, therefore, gives the artists the chance of making money.\n\n, Before television in 1976, the World Wide Web in 1995, MXit in 2005 (a cellular phone chat application) and especially Facebook, people either went to the theatres, cinemas (alias bioskoop) participate in sports or read books. There was a boom of books especially from the 1950s \u2013 1970s, but interest declined onwards as time progressed. The best sellers today are recipe books and Christian literature, followed by romantic fiction, detective stories, autobiographies and poetry. Schools are the major stimulators of the children\u2019s literature book market, mainly because prescribed books for the curriculum are being purchased. Because it is rather pricey (and risky) today being an author in Afrikaans, most aspirant authors test their skills on Woes.co.za. Have a look over there.\n\n, http:\/\/afrikaans.news24.com\/; Die Burger.com (for Cape Provinces); Volksblad.com (for Free State) and Beeld.com (covers the earlier Transvaal) has all the latest South African and international news in Afrikaans. Republikeinonline.com.na has all the latest Namibian and international news in Afrikaans. Though it should be added that newspapers tend to be bugged by language errors, clich\u00e9s, jargon and Anglicism, it\u2019s a good way of picking up neologisms and to get in closer contact with the Afrikaans speaking community.\n\n,, From January 2010 Roepman, Jakhalsdans, Ek lief jou, Ek joke net, Die Ongelooflike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom, Liefling, Getroud met Rugby and Platteland has been released. English subtitles included. Important: Though most of the films\u2019 setting are in rural places (such a clich\u00e9!), don't be fooled: the Afrikaans community are well urbanized.\n\n, Get streetwise at: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_South_African_slang_words\n\n, Other than the anti-egalitarianism issue, the Afrikaans community is not fastidious about choice of words and are constantly simplifying the rules. Enjoy!\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":984}

{"text":" There is no magic number or time at which a person is ready for dating. It's dependent on who you are, how mature you feel and what your parents think about it too. Indeed, it's a combination of factors. At this point, don't feel bad if you don't actually feel like dating yet\u2013\u2013that's okay to, you can have friends instead of dates too and nobody will think any the worse of you for it.\n\n\nTake a little time to better understand your own motivations for having a boyfriend or going out. How big a factor is each of the following for you: wanting friendship\/companionship and someone to hang out with; wanting to have someone else interested in your well-being and listen to your worries and joys; wanting affection (hugs, touch and nonphysical affection, romance, etc.); wanting to be accepted and cool and not seen as a loner by schoolmates? Which of these are your main motivators? The better you understand your own needs and motives, the better your decisions and choices will be about whether to ask a boy out, and if so, who to ask, and how to do it.\nTaking the time to introspect and understand yourself better is a lifelong process important for adults as well as for middle school students.;\n, If they don't think that dating boys is appropriate right now, they mean it and they have good reasons. Listen to them and just find friends instead. There's plenty of time for love later.\n\n\nIf you're parents are cautious but open to the possibility, explain how responsible you'd be if you went on a date, such as meeting curfew times, letting them know where you are going and being reachable by phone at all times.\n\n, Ask them what they think about dating and how comfortable they feel about it. While you don't need to agree with what they say or think, it can be helpful to gauge their feelings and get ideas to form your own thoughts.\n\n, Once you're happy that you're ready to date, try getting to know this boy better.\n\n, He might not turn out to be the kind of person you first thought. It makes good, common sense to get to know him a little before asking him out. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can use to get to know this great person somewhat better.\n\n, Make it a group thing. Get your friends and his friends to mingle at recess, lunch and after school. Make it all seem most casual, and just hang about chatting to everyone, including him.\n\n\nMake friends with him and his friends. It will make him feel closer to you without realizing just yet what your real intentions are. This gives you the space to study him close up and kindly.\n\n, Have casual conversations with him about school, sport, your uniforms, school rules, anything really that is simple, relevant and easy to chat about.\n\n\nFind out what interests him and let him know just a little about what interests you.\nHere are some conversation starters: \"Want some gum?\" \"Hey, do you have any gum?\" \"Okay, no more projects on cells. Mine looked like it came out of a horror movie!\" or \"Random Question: are you a morning or night person?\". If you are in different years\/grades, ask him what he thinks you'd like next year.\nDon't chew his head off with \"me, me, me\" talk though. Instead, make the aim to learn as much as you can about him. He'll ask you enough things in time.\n\n, Give him little gifts now and then, such as chocolates. But be sure to give them to his and your friends at the same time. You're trying to prove you're a generous lassie, not someone focused only on him\u2013\u2013that comes shortly. For now, show him what a great spirit of generosity you are.\n\n, Send a friend request and bond online. Send casual messages, jokes, funny pictures and nice sayings. Keep it light and friendly and include your other friends initially so that he looks like he's just one among many recipients of your online banter. As time goes on, you may grow to feel comfortable just chatting or messaging him.\n\n, He doesn't want to know what you're doing every five seconds and he certainly doesn't want to have answer to you about what he's doing every five seconds. Instead, just get to know his schedule, work around it with the occasional \"hello\", \"how's it going\" and \"wow, isn't funny how we keep bumping into each other?\" moments.\n\n\nIf you're online, take the chance to now and then send something with a \"when I saw this, it made me think of you, 'coz I know you like the LOL cat\/etc. pictures\".\n\n, Do you want him to be your boyfriend? Before you ask him out, be sure he's the one. Before you decide that you're in love, know what your own feelings are. Make a list of the negatives and positives about him, and then decide.\n\n, At least have inkling that this guy has grown fond of you and is somewhat into you. Signs include him breaking the touch barrier, lingering gazes, fond nicknames, making excuses to be near you, texting or messaging you a lot, blowing you kisses and generally being sweet to you. In some cases, he might be a little more brash and teasing toward you, because he feels comfortable around you. If you've gotten the impression that he's keen, it might be time. Ask him when you feel right and comfortable!\n\n, If so, flirt a little, make eye contact more often and pass a few sweet notes to him in class. Make it clear that you're keen on him.\n\n, He's yours for the taking if you've noted the signs correctly and feel you know him well enough by now.\n\n\nRehearse asking. If it helps you to gain confidence, practice beforehand. First, write down what you want to say. Then, practice in the mirror. Look at your body language and facial expressions. Practice until you feel confident.\n\n, This is especially important at the middle school and junior school levels. This isn't about determining your love match for life; it's about gaining a fun and carefree romantic friendship and the main thing is that you both feel comfortable with one another.\n\n\nSay something like, \"Want to go for a slurpee over lunch break?\". This is perfect. Make sure his lunches are free first.\nOr, casually ask \"So do you have band\/yearbook\/practice, etc. today? Mind if I come too\".\nOr, \"Hey, would you like to come with me to the movies\/park\/skate rink, etc. this weekend?\"\nIf asking him out over text message, say something like: \"My friends think we should get married. Spring wedding sound good?\" Expect a \"lol\" as a response. Then after he responds, say something like, \"Yeah, but I really do like you.\" Do try to use full words as often as possible; text messages can look really stupid if you use text language (u for you, r for are).\n\n, Realize that he may need time to process your request to get together, hang out or go on a date, and that's fine. Let him know it's fine and that he can get back to you.\n\n\nIf he says no, that's all right. He's probably embarrassed, or he hasn't made up his mind. Be understanding, and don't become defensive or act hurt. Never stall or make excuses. But at least he knows you like him and he might start looking at you in a different way.\nIf he says yes, say \"great\" and start planning your date, make sure you pay, unless he insists.

No he will either say yes, no or I'll think about it (if the later, don't let him leave you hanging indefinitely; move on). Only ask if you really like him! Don't do it if you're just making it up! If he gives you something, try to give him something back the next day.\n\n, He may be with his friends more often than when he is with you. This is normal, and part of a healthy relationship!\n\n, If he sees that you care and want to see him more often, he may become more committed to the relationship. (Try to have a few activities in mind to do together, like playing video games, baking brownies, watching a favorite show or movie, shooting hoops at the nearest basketball goal, etc.)\n\n, Depending on the sort of guy he is, if he comes around to your house, find a comfy spot and lean in. Boys love kissing! However, if you aren't comfortable, don't force yourself.\n\n, You want to keep in touch with him, but not 24\/7! He might think you're a nag, or that you don't trust him. Text him once or twice a day, if he responds, YAY! But you can't expect him to. Also, if you see him in the hallway just say hi. If he stops you to talk, stay there and have a short conversation or tell him you'll talk to him at lunch.\n\n, If he is mean, cruel, or disinterested, just move on. He may be cute or cool, but it's just not worth being mistreated to try to pursue him. Pick someone new to like. Always remember that boys don't control your happiness.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":986}

{"text":" The employee handbook should include a general introductory paragraph that outlines the purpose of the handbook. You should welcome the employee to the company and discuss the company\u2019s goal of being a rewarding place to work for employees. You should also reiterate the importance of the employer\/employee relationship.For example, you may state: \u201cWe at are confident you will find our company is a dynamic and engaging place to work, and we look forward to your contribution to our continued success. We consider our employees to be our most valuable resource. This handbook will serve as guide for the relationship between employer and employee.\u201d;\n, You should also make sure the introduction to the handbook contains a disclaimer that the handbook is not a legal, binding contract between employer and employee. This will help to prevent legal disputes and protect your company in the event of a legal issue in the future.For example, you may state: \u201cThis handbook only contains general information and guidelines. It is not a binding legal contract and does not act as a contractual right to remain employed by the company.\u201d\n\n, This is another important disclaimer that should be included in the employee handbook. You should make sure you state that your company is not obligated to retain employees and note that an employee can be dismissed at the discretion of the company. This will ensure the handbook is not seen as a contract by employees or cannot be used as such in a court of law.For example, you may state: \u201cYour employment may be terminated at any time with or without cause and without prior notice by the company. You may also resign at any time.\u201d\n\n, You should also include an acknowledgement page that needs to be acknowledged and signed by the employee. This will ensure the employee has agreed to the terms of the handbook and signifies the employee understands the policies in the handbook.You can find samples of an acknowledge page for employees through the Society for Human Resource Management website and the National Federation of Independent Business website.\n\n, Most federal and state governing bodies require companies to provide a clear, detailed wage policy in the employee handbook. Each state has different employment laws and require you to include different information about employee wages in the handbook. Get familiar with your state\u2019s laws to ensure you cover all the requirements.You may need to check the federal laws for employers through the U.S. Department of Labor website, or your country\u2019s applicable Department of Labor website. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for your company\u2019s handbook before you outline any policies or expectations.\n\n, Your employee handbook should note your legal obligations on pay schedules and overtime pay. Your employees should know how often they are getting paid as well as if they get paid for overtime work. You should outline the expected work hours for your employees, depending on if they are full-time or part-time.Include descriptions of exempt and non-exempt employees. Exempt employees are typically upper-level management and are excluded from laws governing minimum wage, overtime, and other wage practices.Your description should include the definition of overtime. For example, working longer that 9 hours per day, 40 hours per week, holidays, etc. Be sure to mention that travel time or prep time to be ready for work are compensated.\nYou should also note your company\u2019s policy on coffee breaks and lunch breaks, such as how long each employee is allowed for these breaks. This will ensure your employees know what to expect in terms of managing their time.\n\n, In the employee handbook you should also discuss the compensation packages your company offers its employees. This may include bonuses, stock options, and salary increases over time. Make sure you offer compensation packages that are realistic and affordable for the company, as you may need to follow through on these commitments in the future., Your company may be required by state or federal law to offer employee benefits like health benefits, dental benefits, and life insurance. These employee benefits should be briefly outlined in the handbook. You should not go into specific detail as your benefits policies may change and you do not want to put outdated or incorrect information in the handbook.Make sure you should mention who is eligible for benefits, such as full-time employees, part-time employees, and their families and spouses. You should also explain the criteria for enrolling in benefits and when you can change benefits, such as in the event of marriage or the birth of a child.\nYour benefits guide should also include details of any company-sponsored retirement or savings plan. Make sure to include any relevant policies such as contribution matching or vesting periods.\n\n, For companies where employees may be required to use their personal property or travel for business purposes, you will need to outline the policy for company reimbursement of these expenses, if any. Be clear on which expenses are the responsibility of the company and which the responsibility of the employee. Outline the process of gaining approval for reimbursement and listing expenditures., Under federal law, you are required to have leave policies in place. You must have a family medical leave providing employees with up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for the birth or care of a child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or if the employee develops a serious medical condition. You should check your state\u2019s policies for unpaid family leave.You should also explain the company\u2019s policies for holiday leave, such as how much holiday time a year employees are given as part of their employment. You should outline the amount of time allowed for the death of a family member and for sick leave.\nMake sure you discuss your company\u2019s vacation leave policy, including how vacation time is earned and how to request time off. You should include a list of holidays observed by the company, with clear details about when the company closes or stays open during holiday times.\n\n, The employee handbook should outline the values and expectations you would like to see in your employees. You should discuss how you would like employees to behave and communicate in the workplace. You should also note a contact person that employees can speak to if they have any questions or clarifications.You should also maintain a positive and encouraging attitude in your discussion of employee expectations. This will keep your employees engaged in the handbook and make it feel accessible to them.\nFor example, you may note, \u201cWe expect our employees to adhere to a high standard of professional conduct and integrity. As an employee, you should be respectful and courteous to the feelings and needs of others. Individuals who act inappropriately or unprofessionally may be subject to disciplinary action.\u201d\n\n, If your workplace has a specific dress code, you should include it in the employee handbook. Make sure you are clear about the requirements for the dress code and specify the company\u2019s expectations for how employees should appear in the workplace.For example, if your company has an office setting, you may have a business casual dress code. You may note that all employees are required to adhere to a business casual dress code and appear well groomed.\nGive visual example of acceptable clothing and grooming, since ideas may vary between social groups and generations.\nInclude specific regulations about beards, visible tattoos, and head apparel that might be religious.\nIf your employees are often in the field working on construction sites, for example, you may require your employees to wear safety gear or clothing at all times. You should outline these requirements in the handbook so employees are aware of how they should appear every day in the field.\n\n, By law, many states require companies to have a clearly stated equal employment and non-discrimination policy in their employee handbook. You must clearly state that your company prohibits discrimination in the workplace.You should also make sure you discuss the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which specifies anti-discrimination against people with disabilities. You can find out more about the ADA on the Americans with Disabilities website.\n\n, Your company should also have an anti-harassment policy that clearly states that no harassment under any circumstances is tolerated in the workplace. Often you are required by federal or state law to have these policies in place for your employees.You should have a process in place for filing a harassment complaint so employees know how to file a complaint and who to talk to about the issue. You may have a Human Resources representative who is responsible for addressing any harassment complaints in the workplace.\n\n, You should also make sure your employee handbook includes a policy on how to use company computers and software appropriately in the office and off-premise. This is especially important if the majority of the employee work is done on company computers.Make sure you outline how employees can secure their electronic information and protect any passwords or company information on their computers. You should also note any safety measures you have in place to protect the privacy of your employees online and your business\u2019s information.\nYou should also have guidelines around appropriate use of the computer and what sites employees can and cannot access. You should make sure employees are clear on what sites the company network can be used to access and note the importance of keeping company information private when communicating through email.\nNote any security steps that might be viewed as an intrusion of employee's privacy, explaining why they are necessary for company security.\n\n, You should also include details about how your employees are going to be reviewed on their performance in the workplace. You may put a performance review metric in the handbook or include general guidelines on how and when performance reviews will happen for your employees.For example, you may note that employees receive yearly reviews and that positive reviews usually lead to a salary increase or a bonus. You may also discuss disciplinary action that may occur if the employee does not receive a positive performance review, such as a probationary period for the employee, followed by a second performance review or termination.\nIn particular, note any conduct that might result in immediate dismissal, such as drug and alcohol use, theft, harassment, violence, or other serious offenses.\n\n, Your employees should be aware of all security measures on your premises, including security cameras, detectors, and guards. Include any operating procedures required for getting through security. Describe any off-limits or restricted-access areas, along with a clear description of who is or is not allowed to enter them. For clarity, you may wish to include a map showing these areas., You may be required to comply with Occupational Health and Safety laws in your state and you should mention these laws in your employee handbook. You should note that all employees must report all accidents, injuries, potential safety hazards, and any safety related issues to management.You should also have safety policies in place regarding poor weather or hazardous work conditions. This is especially important if your employees often work in the field or off site.\n\n, You should also include a process for reporting incidents on the job, such as an injury while working or a robbery. Your employees should be aware of how they can report an incident and who they can speak to in the event of an incident.You may have a detailed process in the employee handbook for incident reporting or keep it more general. You may want to opt for a more general discussion if you think the reporting process may change in the future.\n\n, You should also include a clear plan of action in the event of an emergency, such as a fire in the workplace or a natural disaster like flooding or severe weather. You should have an exit plan for employees to follow on a map in the handbook and discuss safety areas or points outside of the building., The employee handbook should be accessible and easy to read for every employee with a tone that is conversational rather than formal or stiff. Try to appeal to every employee by using a tone that is approachable and clear.You can do this by imagining the handbook is a conversation you are having with an employee as an employer. You should use a tone that is clear and friendly when you are talking to your employee, and stay away from formal or stiff language.\n\n, Labor laws can be complex but this does not mean your employee handbook has to be littered with verbiage or jargon. Instead, go for clear language and simplified terms. Having legal terms that are difficult to understand may not protect your company legally in the end and will only alienate the employees that are reading the handbook.You should try to avoid using formal terms like \u201cmanagement\u201d or \u201cauthority.\u201d Instead, use \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d so the employee does not feel overwhelmed. You want the tone to sound casual, as your employees are more likely to read the handbook in full if it appears friendly and engaging.\n\n, Avoid putting in guidelines in the handbook that are overly demanding or unreasonable. You want the handbook to act as a useful guide for your employees and do not want to create rules that are difficult or impossible to achieve.You should also try to keep the handbook short and sweet, with just enough information to fulfill the state requirements for employee handbooks. You do not want to overwhelm your employees with information or with strict rules that are hard to follow.\n\n, Your employee handbook is a crucial document that could be used in a legal dispute later by your employees. You should get the handbook reviewed by a lawyer or a legal review to make sure your wording is clear and you are not making your company liable for any legal issues in the future. Once it has been cleared by the legal review, it will be ready to distribute to new and current employees at your company.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":989}

Do this before contacting a real estate agent so you have a firm idea of what you can afford, and you don't accidentally fall in love with a that you cannot afford.\n\n\nSellers love buyers who get pre-approved. Pre-approved buyers are almost always given the green light by lenders, meaning there's less risk for the deal to get scuttled in the end.\nDon't accidentally get pre-qualified instead of pre-approved. There's a difference. Pre-approval means that the lender is usually prepared to give you a loan after seeing your financial vitals. Pre-qualified only means that the lender is estimating what you could borrow. It doesn't mean you'll get a loan., Wait \u2014 why would I shop for a mortgage before deciding on a house? Isn't that totally backward?Not necessarily. Shopping for a mortgage before you decide on a house can be beneficial for one overriding reason:\n\n\nYou'll know exactly how much you can borrow before you buy your home. Too many people fall in love with a home that they \u2014 well \u2014 can't afford. They struggle finding a mortgage that covers the cost of the home. Finding a mortgage first and a home second may seem less appealing, but it's twice as smart. You'll immediately be able to tell whether a home is in your price range or out of it.\nThink about the sort of down-payment you'll be able to afford. This should be part of your mortgage calculations, although you don't need to know for sure when shopping for a mortgage. Have a general idea in mind. More on this later in the article.\n\n, \"28 and 36\" is a commonly used ratio. It means that 28% of your gross income (before you pay taxes) must cover your intended housing expenses (including principal and interest on the mortgage, as well as real estate taxes and insurance). Monthly payments on your outstanding debts, when combined with your housing expenses, must not exceed 36% of your gross income. Find each percentage for your monthly gross income (28% and 36% of $3750 = $1050 and $1350, respectively). Your monthly payments on outstanding debts cannot exceed the difference between the ($300) or else you will not be approved., If you qualify for a first time home buyer program, these often have much lower down payment requirements. These are offered by various states and local governments. You may also be able to access up to $10,000 from your 401(k) or Roth IRA without penalty. Ask your broker or employer's human resources department for specifics regarding borrowing against those assets.\n\n, If you expect the buying of the house to be a simple, straightforward affair, then you'll probably only need a Realtor, the escrow company, and perhaps a mortgage broker. But then again, when do things ever go as expected? Hire an honest, reputable, (relatively) cheap lawyer if:\n\n\nThe cost of the lawyer is a drop in the bucket compared to the total you are likely to spend for the home.\nThe home you are buying is either in foreclosure or in probate, which means that the home is being distributed as part of a deceased person's estate.\nYou suspect the seller might try to quickly back out of the deal or you don't trust them.\nYour state requires a lawyer at closing. Six states currently require a lawyer present.Talk to your state commission of real estate to find out if it's common practice in your state. It is also a good idea to check with an attorney before entering into a contract.\n\n, The real estate agent should be: amiable, open, interested, relaxed, confident, and qualified. Learn the agent's rates, methods, experience, and training. In the United States, sellers pay the Realtor commission while buyers may pay a fee for having the Realtor represent them. Look for a Realtor who lives local, works full time, closes several properties per year, and has a reputation for being busy. Read more in How to Select a Realtor.\n\n\nA Realtor's job is to connect people who want to buy and sell a particular home. For this reason, a Realtor has an interest in selling homes. A very good Realtor will use her experience to sell the right home to the right buyer \u2014 you. A Realtor can tell you about the schools, nearby shopping, zoning of the property, construction nearby, ages and values of nearby properties, growth rate, and any other statistics on the area you may be interested in.\nWhen you do find your Realtor, go into exhaustive detail when describing what you want in a home \u2014 number of bathrooms and bedrooms, attached garage, land and anything else that may be important, such good lighting or yard space for the kids.\n\n, A Multiple Listing Service will give you a feeling for what is on the market in your price range. Your agent can do this for you.\n\nIf you sign up through a real estate agent, it is poor form to call the listing agent directly to see a house. Don't ask an agent to do things for you unless you're planning to have them represent you \u2014 they don't get paid until a client buys a house and it's not fair to ask them to work for free, knowing that you're not going to use them to buy your home!\n\n, Most lenders suggest that you pay no more than 38% of your monthly income towards your mortgage and debts combined. This means, on any given month, no more than 38% of your paycheck goes to paying back loans. You should use an online Home Affordability Calculator to find your own sweet spot. However, for a good idea of the house you can afford, tally up your current monthly bills, including credit cards, student loans, etc, and compare them against your income in the following sheet:Finding a Mortgage you Can Afford Based on Current Bills and Income\n\n\n\n\nIncome: $35,000\nIncome: $50,000\nIncome: $75,000\nIncome: $100,000\n\n\nMonthly Bills: $0\nUp to $187,000, or $1,050\/mo\nUp to $264,000, or $1,500\/mo\nUp to $391,938, or $2,225\/mo\nUp to $520,000, or $3,000\/mo\n\n\nMonthly Bills: $100\nUp to $170,113, or $950\/mo\nUp to $246,898, or $1,400\/mo\nUp to $374,875, or $2,125\/mo\nUp to $502,851, or $2,900\/mo\n\n\nMonthly Bills: $500\nUp to $101,859, or $550\/mo\nUp to $178,644, or $1,000\/mo\nUp to $306,621, or $1,750\/mo\nUp to $434,597, or $2,500\/mo\n\n\nMonthly Bills: $1,000\nShould not buy house\nUp to $93,327, or $500\/mo\nUp to $221,303, or $1,250\/mo\nUp to $349,279, or $2,000\/mo\n\n\n\n, You probably already have a vague idea, but the angel's in the details. There are a couple things in particular that you and your family should give good thought to:\n\n\nWhat will you and your family need in several years?Maybe you're just a couple right now, but are there are plans for kids in the future? A home that snugly fit two people could be torturous for three or four.\nWhat tradeoffs are you willing to make? In other words, what are your priorities? Although we like to believe that buying a house can be straightforward, it's often a complex ordeal in which we're forced to compromise. Do you care more about a safe neighborhood and good schools over a big backyard? Do you need a big, workable kitchen more than a big luxurious bedroom? What are you willing to sacrifice when it's crunch time?\nDo you expect your income to increase over the next couple years? If your income has increased by 3% for several years in a row and you hold a secure job in a safe industry, you can probably rest assured that buying an expensive but still reasonable mortgage is possible. Many homebuyers buy relatively expensive and then grow into their mortgage after a year or two.\n\n, Scout out what's available in the vicinity. Look at prices, home design, proximity to shopping, schools and other amenities. Read the town paper, if there is one, and chat with the locals. Look beyond the home to the neighborhood and the condition of nearby homes to make sure you aren't buying the only gem in sight.\n\nThe area in which your home is located is sometimes a bigger consideration than the home itself, since it has a major impact on your home's resale value. Buying a fixer-upper in the right neighborhood can be a great investment, and being able to identify up-and-coming communities \u2014 where more people want to live \u2014 can lead you to a bargain property that will only appreciate in value.\n\n, Pay attention to overall layout, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, kitchen amenities, and storage. Visit properties you're seriously interested in at various times of the day to check traffic and congestion, available parking, noise levels and general activities. What may seem like a peaceful neighborhood at lunch can become a loud shortcut during rush hour, and you'd never know it if you drove by only once.\n\n, If you are unsure about the price, have the home appraised by a local appraiser, who also looks at comparables. When appraising a home, appraisers will look for comparable homes or \u201ccomps\u201d in the area that have similar features, size, etc. If your home is more expensive than the comps, or the appraiser has to find comps in a different subdivision or more than 1\u20442 mile (0.8\u00a0km) away, beware! Never buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood. Your bank may balk at financing the home, and you probably won't see your home appreciate in value very much. If you can, buy the least expensive home in a neighborhood \u2014 as homes around you sell for more money than you paid, your home's value increases.\n\n, This is not easy, and often impossible, but it doesn't hurt to try when making one of the biggest purchases in your life. Here are some things to keep in mind as you think about your offer:\n\nWhat are the seller's financial prospects? Are they in desperate need of money or are they sitting on a pile of cash? Cash-strapped sellers will be more likely to take an offer that undercuts their asking price.\nIf the house is a flip, the seller is often less emotionally invested and wants to sell quickly. Have your agent call the seller's agent and find out what they want for the property. People flipping houses usually already have a number in mind. You can find out if a house is a flip by looking at sale records, if it sold recently (around a year ago) and for much less than it's listed for now, and looks upgraded, it's probably a flip. You can also look it up on Google Maps street view to get some insight as to what it looked like before. If it looked run down with boarded up windows, and now it's looking pretty nice, it's probably a flip. It can also help to reassure the seller that you can close quickly (if you really can!).\nHow long has the home been on the market? Homes that have been on the market for longer periods of time can usually be bid down.\nHave they already bought another house? If the sellers aren't currently living in the house they're trying to sell, it may be easier to bid less than you otherwise might.\n\n, Estimate the annual real estate taxes and insurance costs in your area and add that to the average price of the home you're trying to buy. Also add how much you can expect to pay in closing costs. (These take in various charges that generally run between 3 to 6 percent of the money you're borrowing. Credit unions often offer lower closing costs to their members.) Put the total into a mortgage calculator (you can find them online or make your own in a spreadsheet. If the figure is above 28% of your gross income (or whatever the lower percentage used by lenders in your situation) then you will have a hard time getting a mortgage.\n\n\nDetermine whether you need to sell your current home in order to afford a new one. If so, any offer to buy that you make will be contingent on that sale. Contingent offers are more risky and less desirable for the seller, since the sale can't be completed until the buyer's house is sold. You may want to put your current house on the market first.\n\n, Economics of supply and demand will sometimes force your hand. If many people are competing for few homes, be prepared to lead with your highest possible offer. Some homebuyers don't believe that you should lead with your highest offer, but you could easily find yourself being outbid and never get the chance to bid on your house. If you want to give yourself the best shot on a home that you really, really like, lead with a high bid.\n\n, Although the guidelines for submitting offers may differ from state to state, this is usually how it goes: You submit your offer to your Realtor, who then forwards it to the seller's representative. The seller then decides to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer.\n\n\nInclude earnest money with your offer. This is typically 1-5% of the offer. Once you sign an offer, you are officially in escrow, unless you cancel using an accepted contingency to the contract during the contingency period. During escrow (typically 30 to 90 days), your lender arranges for purchase financing and finalizes your mortgage.\nConsider putting an expiration time on your offer if you or your agent think it makes sense for that situation. For example, if you put a 24 hour expiration, you're only bound to that offer for 24 hours. This can put a little pressure on the seller to act quickly.\n\n, A down payment establishes equity, or ownership, in a home. That's also money that you don't have to pay interest on. The more of a down payment you're able to make on your home, the less money you'll ultimately pay on your home.\n\n\nYou may be expected to put down 10-20% of the appraised value of a home depending on your loan package. However, there are loan packages that allow you to put down much less. Note that the appraised value may be higher or lower than the selling price of the house. If you have $30,000 saved for a down payment, for example, you can use it as a down payment for a home between $300k (10% down payment) or $150k (20% down payment). Putting less down often, but not always, requires you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which increases your monthly housing cost but is tax deductible. However, 20% is the typical amount for not needing to pay PMI.\nIf you can't afford a 10%-20% down payment on your home, but have good credit and steady income, a mortgage broker may assist you with a combination or FHA mortgage. FHA mortgages only require 3.5% down payment and there are other loan packages that require as little as 3% down. There are also USDA and VA loan that require no money down. Talk to your mortgage broker to find your best option.\n\n, Request the following surveys and reports: inspection, pests, dry rot, radon, hazardous materials, landslides, flood plains, earthquake faults, sewer scope and crime statistics. (You will generally have 7-10 days to complete inspections \u2014 be sure that your agent explains this fully to you when signing the purchase and sales contract.)\n\n\nA home inspection costs between $150 and $500, depending on the area, but it can prevent a $100,000 mistake. This is especially true with older homes, as you want to avoid financial landmines such as lead-paint, asbestos insulation and mold.\nIf you use the inspection results to negotiate down the price of your purchase, then include the portion of the inspection report that notes the deficiency to prove that it exists.\n\n, Getting a home energy audit is an essential part of the home buying experience. Not knowing what it really costs to heat and cool a home is a potential financial disaster waiting to happen. Home buyers make \"guesstimates\" when figuring out a new home budget. These estimates can be significantly incorrect and place families into dire financial circumstances.\n\n, This is usually conducted in an escrow office and involves signing documents related to the property and your mortgage arrangements. The packet of papers includes the deed, proving you now own the house, and the title, which shows that no one else has any claim to it or lien against it. If any issues remain, money may be set aside in escrow until they are resolved, which acts as an incentive for the seller to quickly remedy any problem areas in order to receive all that is owed.\n\n\nConsider using your real-estate lawyer to review closing documents and represent you at closing. Again, Realtors are unable to give you legal advice. Lawyers may charge $200-$400 for the few minutes they're actually there, but they're paid to look out for you.\n\n","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":991}
{"text":" Score tries by carrying the ball into Your opponent's try-zone, ( penalty tries can also be awarded from any infringements from the opposing team.) A try is worth 5 points.\n\n\nWhen a try is scored an opportunity is given to the scoring team to make a conversion kick which is worth 2 points.\nThe other way of gaining extra points for Your team is with penalty kicks, this is awarded when a member of the opposing team breaks a rule or if the play of the game is stopped by more than one member of that team. a Penalty kick is worth 3 Points.\nThe last method of gaining points is with a drop-goal attempt, the ball is played backwards to a back-row player who then attempts to place the ball in between the uprights during ongoing game play, this is also worth 3 points.;\n, If you get the ball into your opponent's try zone you get 5 points, as well as a chance to attempt a conversion kick for an extra 2 points. The winner is the one who scores the most points in 80 minutes of play.\n\n\nYou have to touch the ball down to score in rugby. That means after you've entered the try zone the ball must be placed on the ground to score.You can also kick the ball through the uprights during free play (with a drop-kick only) or after the referee awards your team a penalty (place kick) for 3 points., To score tries, offense teams form big horizontal lines, passing sideways and backward until they expose a hole in the defense and push forward. This is the big rule to remember when playing rugby. You cannot pass the ball forward with your hands or it is an automatic penalty. Whenever passing, you usually pass the ball across your body to get power and throw the ball diagonally to your teammate.\n\n\nDropping or bobbling the ball counts as a forward pass if it hits your hands then hits the ground in front of you.\nYou can, of course, carry the ball forward. However, any passes by the hand cannot be forward., While you cannot ever throw a ball forward, you can kick it forward at any time. Once you kick the ball, any teammate that was behind you when you kicked it can run forward and get the ball without a penalty. Kicks are a great way to surprise a defense, or boot the ball way down the field to get your team out of trouble.\n\n\nPlayers can even kick it to themselves, chipping it over an opponent and running around to pick it up.\nYou cannot kick the ball to a teammate who is already further down the field than you unless you run past them at some point. If a player was behind you at any time after your kick they can touch the ball. If not, they are offside., Rugby defense is all about making tackles. You can only hit the player currently holding the ball, and you cannot block or screen the other team or other players. When you tackle an opponent, your goal is to bring them to the ground as quickly as possible, preferably with teammates around to quickly help win the ball. General tackling rules include:\n\n\nYou must tackle someone below shoulder height.\nYou must wrap your hands around the player, not just spear them with your shoulder.\nYou cannot pick up and drop players, especially on their head or neck.\nOnce down, you must return to your feet before trying to win the ball from someone you've tackled., When a player goes down, they must release the ball. From there, either team can fight to win the ball off the ground and take possession. This usually takes place as a \"ruck.\" A ruck is when 1-3 players from each team lock into one another, right above the ball (and tackled player), and push each other back and forth in an attempt to win possession. One player on each team stands behind the ruck and grabs the ball when it appears behind their rucking teammate's back foot. Because the tackled player can put the ball down wherever they want, the team that had the ball first usually controls it. There are a lot of rules and strategy for contesting a ruck, but some basic reminders include:\n\n\n\nStay on your feet. A ruck is when at least two players lock shoulders above the ball and try and push the opponent away from the ball. You cannot reach in to grab the ball or push off the ground with your hands.\n\nEnter through the center. For safety reasons, you must enter a ruck straight up and lock in with the other team. You must be perpendicular to the end line, and your body must be straight over the ball. You cannot run into a ruck diagonally or from the side.\n\nStay behind the back foot if not in the ruck. Once a ruck is formed, you must stay behind the back foot of your final teammate until the ball comes out, no matter what team gets it. The entire space of the ruck is a \"neutral zone\" that no players can enter it., When a penalty (such as passing it forward) is called for your team, you get several options of restarts, depending on the foul. One of the most common is a scrum, where both teams form into battering rams and connect over the ball. A scrum is essentially a test of strength. In a scrum, 8 players from each team weave themselves together in rows to create a unified mass. The two teams then go head-to-head, each pushing against the other, with a tunnel formed on the ground in between them.\n\n\nIn a scrum, one team throws the ball in the center of the two teams and they push and hook each other to try and win the ball.\nScrums suck all the biggest players to one area of the field, leaving the other seven players with much more free space. If your team wins it, you're often off for a big gain.\nScrums are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of rugby, and you should not try them without a coach and well-trained, athletic players., If a ball goes out of bounds the referee will call for a line-out. A line-out is like a throw-in in soccer, except the ball must be thrown straight forward. Each team forms a line on the field around the thrower. The team that did not touch the ball last gets to throw it in. They then toss the ball straight in between the two teams, who lift each other up to try and win the ball. The game then restarts as normal.\n\n\nTeams often use signals and codes to win their own line-outs. Basically, a thrower will signal to their team when they will throw it, and their teammates will hoist a player into the air, out of reach of the other team, to grab the ball quickly., Each team is made up of two smaller sections, each with their own positions and strengths. Forwards take part in the scrum, and this is the only real difference between them an backs as far as rules go. However, forwards and backs have evolved their own specialties on the field, making each vital to success:\n\n\n\nForwards\/Packies: These are the big guys -- the bruisers and muscle-men who power the scrums and win most of your rucks. Forwards generally take short, powerful runs with the ball, pass less, and do the majority of tackling and defense. Generally thicker and stronger.Backs: The runners and speedsters. Backs form a long diagonal line on offense and pass the ball quickly down the line, to the outside of the field, where they can take on a defender 1v1. On defense they form a wall across the field to prevent enemy backs from breaking through. Generally quicker, backs are good kickers, have solid passing skills, and tons of speed\/endurance., Watch local and professional teams\u2019 matches or practices in order to see how the game is played. You can also watch matches on television or recordings such as DVDs. Watching how a game is played in real life or through recordings allows you to see the intricacies of the sport.\n\n\nThere are a lot of small rules, specific situations, and intricacies to rugby that are impossible to learn without playing or watching. Ask questions of fans and\/or the referee when confused, and keep learning each game each time you play.\n\n, A good rugby throw is powerful and quick, which protects your teammate from a nasty tackle as they watch the ball approaching them. Practice throwing to your side, not in front of you. To get a good throw, use both hands and focus on accuracy first, hitting your teammates right in the chest every time. Once you feel accurate you can start working on a professional-looking spin. To throw from the right hand:\n\n\nStart with the ball horizontally in front of you. Place your right hand on the back third of the ball, so your palm faces down and your thumb towards your target. Place your left hand on the bottom left half of the ball, thumb pointing left.\nBring the ball to your right side, keeping the point of the ball still roughly pointing at your target.\nUsing your left hand for aim and right for power, bring the ball across your body and towards your target.\nAs your hands are almost extended, curl your right hand back towards you, spinning the ball.\nRelease the ball with both hands simultaneously, rotating your wrist completely over on the follow-through. Both arms should be fully extended and pointed at your target, and your arms should stay low, around belly height. the whole time., Tackling is a skill that can be developed over a lifetime, but the basics are simple. You want to let your whole body do the work, not just your arms, to protect yourself and to ensure that you bring the guy down. Practice doing the following steps near simultaneously -- keeping your head up, driving with the shoulder, wrapping your arms, and driving to the ground:\n\n\nSet up on the balls of your feet. Make sure you are in a good athletic position for the hit -- knees bent, muscles relaxed, on your toes.\nKeep your head up and aim for their thighs\/stomach. Keep your head up to see contact coming and line up the hit. This is a crucial step for safety.\nAim to make contact with your shoulder right at their upper thigh. Slide your head next to their butt to keep it safe and drive in with your shoulder.\nWrap your arms around their thighs and pull back. Pull their thighs into a deep hug -- this causes them to lose balance easily.\nDrive with your legs to bring them down. Once you've got your head in place and your arms wrapped, you want to push with your legs to bring them down.\n\n, A ruck is your regular chance to keep or steal possession, and a good rucker is an invaluable asset on the team. If you see a teammate go down with the ball and you're nearby, try and be the first one in the ruck. Set one foot over the ball so that it is underneath you, then lean down into a low athletic position. When you've made contact with someone, win rucks using strength and leverage:\n\n\nGet underneath the opponent and push up and out. If you can get your shoulders or head under their chest, you can push them up to throw them off balance, then back to remove them from the ruck.\nPush teammates from behind to win contested rucks. If it looks like your team needs a boost, push your ruck through like a minor-scrum. Remember, however, that committing more than 2-3 people to a ruck leaves a lot of holes in the defense if you lose.\nKeep your feet moving through the ruck. To really crush rucks, chop your feet and push forward with every step. Imagine running straight through the player to the other side. This is called \"clearing\" a ruck, and it opens up a lot of space. If you're on defense and you can clear a ruck, even if you can't win the ball immediately, you'll throw the other team into disarray., Rugby is not an individually dominated sport. Even the best player will be unable to do anything without the support of teammates, as there are very few times a solo athlete has space or time to make a play themselves. On both defense and offense you should be in the best possible place to support your teammates, no matter what:\n\n\nOn defense, you need to be in a horizontal line with your teammates, sliding left and right to close up any holes the opponent might try to push through. Once a teammate makes a tackle, you should either jump in the ruck if it is open or winnable or slide to either side of the teammate to make sure the other team doesn't exploit the gap while he is down from the tackle,\nOn offense, you need to spread out, forcing the other team to cover many angles. When a teammate is running, make sure you are always behind them and they have 1-2 people in passing range. If they get tackled, they may try a quick pass to you as they go down, leaving you plenty of time to run., Rugby can be played in any large field, so long as it is relatively flat and evenly sized. The size of the field will largely depend upon how seriously you intend to play. If you wish to simply play the game with a few friends, a local park with any large field may be enough. However, if you wish to play a proper match, you will need a field with two uprights for the extra point. Contact your local Parks and Recreation department or a local rugby club to find out about proper fields in your area.\n\n\nAs long as you can mark out try-zones for each team, any rectangular patch of grass should be fine.\nThough the dimensions are slightly different, an American football field can fill in for a rugby field in a pinch.\n\n, There are three commonly played forms of rugby, where the biggest difference is in the number of players. Real games have 15, 10, or 7 players on each team, but you can play with as many players as you want if you're just with friends. Each player should have:\n\n\nAthletic shoes, preferably with cleats in the bottom.\nLight, breathable clothing.\nMouth guards and\/or head protection, if desired.\nWater., Forwards are generally placed in position based on the scrum, and their positions does not necessarily impact where they will be during the rest of the game. What matters most is your scrum position:\n\n\n\nFirst row. The first row contains three players: the loose head prop and the tight head prop, who grip the hooker in between them.The role of the hooker is to gain possession of the ball during scrums and usually throw the ball in at line-outs. The role of the loose and tight head props is to support the hooker during scrums, support other players during line-outs and provide strength during rucks and mauls. The props are your two biggest players.\n\nSecond row. The second row consists of two locks. These are the tallest players in the team and are generally used in line-outs to gain possession of the ball. They drive their shoulders into the props and are the engines of your scrums and rucks.\n\nBack row. The back row of forwards consists of three players: two flankers and the eight-man. They clasp onto the two sides and back and control the direction of the scrum, as well as the ball if it squeezes out. Generally these three are your fastest forwards, as they can quickly dart off the scrum when play restarts., Backs need to be good with their hands, and the best players need to be the first ones touching the ball. To visualize your back line, imagine the ball on the right side of the field. Each player will be 10-15 feet diagonally to the left of the other, starting with the scrum-half:\n\n\n\nScrum-half: They start the ball from a ruck or scrum, pulling it out and determining the first player to get the ball. They must be light, small, and have considerable endurance to reach every ruck or scrum first. Most importantly, they need to see the whole field and distribute the ball accordingly.\n\nFly-half: The quarterback for the backs. They run most of the kicking and run plays, like skipping a pass or fake passes, to try and break down the opponent's defense.\n\nCenters: There are two of them, and they are good overall players who can tackle well on defense, run and pass well in the middle, and kick if need be. They get the ball often and challenge the opponent's back line.\n\nWings: Two wings that stay on each side-line, these are usually the fastest players. Your goal is to get them the ball on the outside, where they can hopefully outrun the opponents wing for massive gains.\n\nFullback: She\/he sits 15 meters or so behind the line, ready to get an opponent's kick, make a last-second tackle, or sprint forward to unexpectedly join the offense and overload a team. Must be versatile, able to kick and catch, and fast., There are several ways in which a penalty may be earned, and it is impossible to play the game and keep an eye out for every infraction. Minor infractions will likely result in a scrum being awarded to the other team. Others may cause a referee to take more serious action, giving a penalty kick, a \"back ten\" (when the team gets 10 meters to run the ball for free), or removing a player for some time.\n\n\nCommon offenses include incorrect tackling, collapsing a scrum or ruck by leaving your feet, holding the ball when on the ground, and entering rucks incorrectly.\nThe team awarded the penalty has several options. They can take a kick or punt, which will allow them to gain field position. They can take a penalty kick at the uprights for a chance at 3 points, or they can take a scrum, all in the location of the penalty.\n\n, A game of rugby is physically intense, and you're incredibly prone to injury if you don't prepare. A good warm-up increases blood flow and prepares your muscles for the beating to come. A good, simple warm up to start with would include:10-minute light jog. Running is an excellent way to warm up for rigorous physical activity. Begin by walking briskly for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of light jogging to prepare yourself for running. Dynamic stretching. Run with high knees, kick your ankle with your heel with each step, do some lunges, jump in place, swing your arms, and skip. These exaggerated, mobile stretches loosen your muscles more effectively than static stretching.\n\nWarm up rugby skills. Pass with a partner, take some kicks, and do some light rucking. Get used to rugby specific actions, even tackling at half-speed. Your forwards should do some practice scrums and lineouts, and your backs should get used to passing in a line.\n\nDrink water and eat at least 2 hours before playing. Hydration is essential in physical activity. In order to combat the loss of and increased use of water during exercise, it is important to stay well hydrated throughout the day but especially right before activity. The other essential nutrients used and expelled by your body during exercise are salt and potassium, eating lean meats, fruits, vegetables, and sports drinks\/food., This is traditionally started by a coin toss, in order to determine which team will have first possession of the ball. You can toss coins or decide who starts in some other manner. Positioned at the center of the field, the team which has first possession will then kick the ball towards the opposition.\n\n\nMost rules state that this must be a drop-kick. It needs to go 10-meters before the ball can be played.\nIf you are on the kicking team, you cannot pass the kicker until the ball has left his foot.\nAfter your team scores a try, the other team must kick it off to you again.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":992}

{"text":" Make a \"C\" with your Index finger, Middle finger, and thumb. Have your ring and pinky fingers right beside them curled upon the holes. Then throw. If done right, the ball may move sideways up to 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m).;\n, Make the holes face right. Put your middle finger on the ball so it covers three of the holes. Put your index finger next to the holes, but separated from your middle finger. Throw 3\/4 submarine and snap your wrist. Throw it outside at the batter's knees for a right handed batter and it should curve up and in the strike zone.\n\n, Hold the ball with the holes to the left. Place your index and middle finger right next to the holes almost touching. Then throw it full submarine so your knuckles almost touch the ground.\n\n, Hold the ball so the holes are to the right and cover the holes with your index and middle finger and throw it over hand. Opposite for righties.\n\n, Most effective for left-handers. Grip the ball like a normal screwball and do the same arm motion except when you release the ball come through it as if your throwing a curve ball, giving it a big loop like a nasty curve ball.\n\n, Hold the ball like you would a riser, but throw overhand, and flick your wrist as you come around.

As long as you have enough flick with your wrist it will slide or screw very smoothly to the right.\n\n, Put the holes so they are facing to the right now put your index and middle finger along the holes while your thumb is underneath and throw it over hand. make sure you aim low and behind the batter because it will break a lot.\n\n, Put the holes facing to the left(right hander) and make a \"c\" with your index finger and thumb. Put your middle finger on the words \"wiffle ball\" on the solid part of the ball. Throw at 3\/4 arm slot. If thrown right it will break all the way from a right handed batter across the zone.\n\n, Throw overhand. It should curve about 3 feet (0.9\u00a0m) to the right.\n\n, the index finger covers the holes for a lefty, and the pointer finger for a right hander. flick your three fingers and it should move a lot while appearing to shake.\n\n, Hold the ball so the holes are facing down and throw the ball 3\/4. you must also throw the ball down a little bit.\n\n, Hold the ball like you would a dropper, except do your full wind up and throw between a submarine and sidearm, and when thrown flick your index and middle finger, when done properly the ball will do the motion of a riser then break like a slider.\n\n, For righties, put the holes facing the left. For lefties, put the holes facing the right. Stick your pointer finger in one hole. Throw overhand.\n\n, Hold a screwball grip and throw 3\/4 submarine and should drop and move like a curve ball.\n\n, Position your hand so that the holes are on the right side of the ball (for Righty Pitchers) and left side for Lefty Pitchers. Make your pointer and middle fingers into a \"V\" and push the ball up between them so it is kind of stuck. Throw the ball at any arm degree. However, between sidearm and 3\/4 arm is the best. The ball should curve away to a righty if thrown over the top, up and away if thrown 3\/4, it will sink if thrown sidearm and will curve in if thrown submarine.\n\n, Hold the wiffle ball with the holes out to the left and your index and middle finger vertical and on the right of the holes. Try to have your fingers on the holes. It's kind of like your giving someone the \"loser\" sign on your forehead but with 2 fingers.\n\n\nHint: Try to aim at a batter who's right handed, it will curve all the way across the plate. Sometimes even around their head and still hit the strike zone.\n\n, Hold the ball with the holes facing to the right, split your fingers, snap your wrist, and throw sidearm\/submarine.( This pitch takes practice, but it helps to learn a riser first and then try snapping your wrist.) This is J.Wayne's pitch.\n\n, Scuff up you wiffle ball and grip it like a curve. Then throw it straight it should either curve like a gyro, curve, or slider.\n\n, With the holes to the left put your index finger in one of the holes. Put your finger in the hole about 3\/4 of the way up your nail. have your middle finger spread about half an inch apart. throw the ball 3\/4 arm, or overhand.\n\n, Holes facing up put your index and middle fingers on the holes on the right of the ball. your thumb should be on the seam on the left of the ball. throw 3\/4 or sidearm and it should curve about a foot and dive about 1 or 2 feet (0.3 or 0.6\u00a0m).\n\n, Holes facing down, get your fingernails on each piece of plastic in between the holes. Get on top; and push rather than toss.\n\n, Put your index and middle finger on the opposite side of where the holes are throw so you turn the ball over to the side with the holes and should drop straight down.\n\n, Have the holes facing the right for righties left for lefties split your fingers and have the middle finger be on the side of the holes have your index finger on the middle of he ball ( finger should be on the left side of the ball) throw side arm and snap your wrist up if thrown right ball will rise and at the last second curve\n\n, Push in the hole side so that it is half a ball. Put the dent to the left. Put your middle finger on the center of the ball and your ring finger right next to it. Leave your pinkie and pointer fingers off of the ball. Throw way to the right of the batter. It's nasty.\n\n, Put the holes on the left side. Put your middle and ring fingers right on the half mark of the ball put your thumb at the bottom and throw it at the batter just watch the \"Humongous Curve\".\n\n, Holes on bottom put middle and index finger on top of ball where the trademark thing is. put thumb on side of holes then twist your wrist it will drop 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m).\n\n, Hold the ball like you would hold a curve ball, but as you release, flick your wrist.\n\n, Hold the the ball with the holes facing away from you and just throw like a fastball. It should curve about 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) to the left.\n\n, Make a \"c\" with pointer middle and thumb. middle finger and thumb should be on the middle of the ball with holes to the right if you are a right-handed pitcher. Pinky and ring finger should be curled up in the small circle where the pat # is (they should not be on the holes). This pitch should be thrown as a sidearm pitch, but the lower the release point the better it is. Just before the release point you should snap your wrist to get maximum rise.\n\n, Hold this pitch the same as a curve ball but just throw it side arm and flick your wrist a lot! You want the holes to be straight up and just let the ball hover right across the plate. It usually stays right where you want to throw it unless you angle your arm awkwardly.\n\n, Hold with the holes facing down and have your index and middle finger over the holes and your thumb on the opposite side of the ball. When you throw you want to bend down to throw, throw across your body.\n\n, Push in the side with holes. put them on the bottom. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist.\n\n, The middle finger goes into a hole while the other stays gripped normally. Deliver like a riser but don't throw it as hard and flick your wrist. It will float across the plate. Make sure to never throw it twice in a row.\n\n, This pitch is the same as the riser just with the holes facing down. For some people the riser and floater are vice versa. With this pitch you also need to have a lot of flick with your wrist in order for it to work.\n\n, Hold the ball like a circle change up, and then throw the ball submarine style. Snap your wrist. This pitch is a counter to the sidearm Rise-ball. To fool the hitter as he\/she sees you pitch sidearm, they are expecting it to rise when all of a sudden it sinks. Hold just like the Rise-ball except turn the holes toward the index finger. (If held out if front of the face the holes should be pointed to the left, opposite for a lefty). Throw this pitch sidearm again. aim high and to the right a little it will sink down and away from a right handed batter. Throw harder for more break.\n\n, Hold the ball as you would for a so-called \"screwball\" so that the holes are to the right of your middle and index fingers (which should be together). Keeping this grip, throw it sidearm w\/ a strong snap of the wrist, this will cause it to rise slightly then drop dramatically, just like a splitter.\n\n, Have the holes of the ball on the left side and put your index finger on the left side of holes or barely on the holes, then do the same with the right middle finger but except on the right side of the holes.\n\n\nHint: If you throw overhand snap your wrists down a little and it should drop a couple of feet.\n\n, Hold the ball on your finger tips on the bottom of the ball. Throw underhand, but exaggeratedly high, and flick your wrist upwards, with as much force as a fastball. It should rise and rise, and the batter will stop to look at it, and it should drop into the zone.\n\n, Put your middle finger in the holes so that they are on the right. Put your thumb on the bottom of the ball. Place your index finger to the left of your middle finger so they are spread apart, but not too far. Throw between 3\/4 and over the top but twist your hand so the holes are in the front while pitching. The ball should drop 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2\u00a0m).\n\n, Hold like a screwball, except split your fingers.throw sidearm and flick your wrist.\n\n, Put pointer finger halfway on the holes and middle finger touching your pointer finger, throw sidearm at an up angle, for example throw sidearm but throw at the top of the strike zone and it will drop about 6 feet (1.8\u00a0m) if thrown hard enough. it will drop right into the strike zone and strike the opponent out!\n\n, Hold the ball like a fastball but split your hands just less than you would for a splitter. you should almost have a slice motion to your throw so that is a 3 quarter throw. the pitch takes practice but it should cut a foot but it looks like it will cut 5!\n\n, Put your index finger on the equator with the holes on the left for righties then have your middle finger an inch to an inch and a half then put your thumb just barely on top of the holes close to the middle then throw it at 3 quarters and it should cut straight across the strike zone.\n\n, Holes on left of the ball put index finger over the middle of the holes, put middle finger on the seam. thumb also on the middle of holes but on bottom of the ball. pitch over the top it should break 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9\u00a0m) away from a righty batter and will drop about 6 to 9 inches (15.2 to 22.9\u00a0cm).\n\n, Have the holes facing you, put your index and middle fingers on the top of the ball and slightly on the holes. Instead of holding it with your fingers hold it with your index and middle knuckles. Your other fingers will tuck in on the side of the ball regularly, not with your knuckles. Also don't let your ring and pinky wrap around the ball just tuck them in with your hand.\n\n, The original knuckle ball is pretty good, but this one is nasty! Push the center of the ball (center being circle in between the holes) and bend your pinky and ring fingers. Place them in the dent you created. Put your pointer and pinky fingers out over side of ball. As you throw it, flick out your bent fingers, it is uncontrollable but moves like crazy!\n\n\nHint: Good luck throwing this one (and hitting it)\nHint: Your hold on the ball should be almost the same as the devil's horns sign.\n\n, Have the holes facing the right. Put middle finger slightly in one of the holes put index finger to the left of the middle finger, put thumb on the bottom of the ball, throw over hand and snap wrist down hard. ball should drop if thrown right about 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m).\n\n, Put your fingers on the side with no holes put your index, middle, and ring knuckles on the ball.Throw towards the ground and snap your wrist. It floats like crazy!\n\n, Put the holes on the bottom with your index, middle, ring, and pinky knuckles right above the median with your thumb on the center of the side with the holes. The batter will think the pitch will move, making him uncomfortable.\n\n, Hold a normal Knuckleball (on the very inner edges\/near the middle of the ball), but, put index and middle inside top two holes, the thumb, ring and pinky on the bottom 3 (should have at least 3 holes open, two on the left and 1 on the right for righties and vice versa for southpaws) and throw as hard and push the ball with the fingers. If successful, the ball should have little-to-no curve and have plenty of speed and drop to it! (play MLB Power Pros for PS2 or Wii and play until you have the Psychic Goggles or face Alvin in the College Kings World Series, where he has the similar, but, more powerful Star Shaker pitch, which acts like a Mirage Knuckle, only moves faster and is harder to hit\/watch MLB Power Pros Success Mode videos to see how the Mirage Knuckle* works.\n\nNote: The Mirage Knuckle is officially known as the Mirage Knuckler! Just be aware when Alvin uses it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n, Hold the ball with the holes facing which ever way you want. Stick your index finger in one of the holes. Not too far in the hole so it is completely stuck. Throw this pitch hard and let your finger come out when you release. It should be off speed. Slow, but should reach the plate after the batter swings.\n\n, Hold the ball with all 5 fingers evenly spaced. Throw like a fastball, except step forward an extra 5\u201310 inches (12.7\u201325.4\u00a0cm). It should appear as a sinker- except stay at the same height.\n\n, When this one works it's sick. Hold the ball like you re making an \"okay\" sign with your hand. So your index and thumb are making a circle and your other fingers are away. Make the circle around the holes of the ball. It tends to curve to the left but it works.\n\n, Face holes toward you and then put hour palm on the part with holes throw like a fastball it will be a little off-speed but don't throw it right over the plate throw it outside.\n\n, Hold like a slider, but with three fingers. Throw sidearm and flick your wrist.\n\n, Hold it with the holes to the left then hold like curve. Flick wrist like screwball. The ball will rise up to the left about 8 inches (20.3\u00a0cm) then have a 12 6 curving action to the right with a drop of about 4 feet (1.2\u00a0m). It is a deadly weapon invented by pro wiffle baller Jason Fargrovin from South Korea.\n\n, Have the holes facing you and put the tips of your index, middle, and ring finger on the top three holes. Have your thumb and pinky on the bottom and almost cover the rest of the holes with your palm. Throw like a fastball put spin the ball by flicking your wrist left our right. It will look like a fastball but break a little bit and slow down.\n\n, Hold the ball like you would a riser (holes down deliver sidearm). During delivery cut under the ball so it spins like a football with the holes forward. When successfully thrown it should rise and slow down in the middle of the pitch.\n\n, Hold the ball with holes up, put mid finger on a space in between the holes and pointer finger on a hole throw overhand.\n\n, Hold the ball with holes facing towards the batter and throw overhand spinning the ball as you throw.\n\n, Hold the ball as you would a fastball and lob it so it just makes it a strike. Only throw when ahead in the count e.g. 0-1 0-2 1-2 or maybe a 1-1 or 2-2 but not anything else. And if they don't swing it's usually a ball.\n\n, Put your pointer and your middle together and others below so holes are on the left side throw lightly it should curve way over to the left.\n\n, Make a C with your thumb, and your middle\/index fingers. Hold the ball so your fingers are on opposite sides of the ball. When throwing this pitch, throw it completely over the top and grip the ball very loosely. When you release the ball it's like you are almost not holding on to it. Exaggerate your follow through, (making sure you actually delivered the ball), and it should drop about 2\u20133 feet (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m).\n\n, Hold the ball between your thumb and palm with your fingers up. Experiment with how the holes go or how many fingers are up!\n\n, This pitch moves a little but is hard to hit. With the holes all facing down, hold your index and middle fingers above the holes parallel to them. Throw sidearm.\n\n, Hold the ball with the holes on the top. Put your index finger in the middle hole, and throw straight forward and down, and when you are about to release, flick your index finger down. It should break 1\u20132 feet (0.3\u20130.6\u00a0m).\n\n, Hold almost like a slider but put thumb a little more up almost toward the trademark thing. Throw almost sidearm and it will do almost anything so it will always fool the batter. Best if used with 2 strikes.\n\n, For righties, have the ball set as a screwball or slider, another way for lefties. Place your fingers like a riser, but your middle and index fingers curled up like a knuckle ball. Push off those 2 fingers and it should not move but it will curve.\n\n, This pitch is very difficult to grip. The holes are facing to the right and your ring and pinkie fingers are bent like you were throwing a knuckle ball. Place your ring and pinkie finger going diagonally up the holes. When pitching to a right-handed batter, aim at him and when throwing, flick your wrist clockwise., Grip the pitch like you would a slider, but throw it like you would a riser. If thrown effectively, it will 'sweep' across the zone. This is useful for pitchers throwing to an opposite hand batter as it is an opposite curve.","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":996}

But to create your own tartan's pattern, you must be familiar with the concepts conveyed in the first part, starting with this next step:;\n, Be exact as you possibly can be, it's important in achieving the exact effect of really replicating the tartan, precisely. Here's a picture of a tartan closeup which had its threads counted.\n, Select the column. Make the color match the tartan's beginning thread color. Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the column (or to a designated row# stopping point) with the color., Use the Color Wheel. Format Cells Fill the row (or to a designated column# stopping point) with the color., continuing over and under this way until you've filled the screen with the full image of the tartan! Be patient with yourself and do the job right, although it may take you hours, or even days to finish. Working with the macros, however, takes much less time in the end., Then, whether you used the Grab app, or Paste Picture, do Command+v, copy.,,,,,,,,,, Well worth it, eh?, You use Advanced Editing to copy All the code to Word and do a Replace All of \"#* \" with nothing, and the code will result, which you can then paste into over a Visual Basic dummy macro you recorded that was meaningless. Read on first, however.\n\nNote: In Sub Macro2(), at the end, there are some Directory path names in code lines which need to be changed to match your computer, please. You can find out what these are by recording a macro to save a file into the folder where you plan to save the tartan work and tartan macro.\nIt is suggested that you make a text copy of any modifications you make to the macro and store them in a Word file to the same folder, for example if you modify the code to make a different tartan than the Anderson tartan.\nRemember, you can always broaden the columns and row heights to get a better look at what's what in terms of thread count relative to the vertical looping down the rows in Sub Macro3().\n\n, Then Developer will appear on your Ribbon and when you click on it, you'll see the Record icon button., Macro1 say, before its end, perhaps overwriting the dummy recorded code, type in Macro2. That will call this Macro2 below, which you've copied in and pasted below Macro1. You therefore can RUN either Macro2 or Macro1 and accomplish the same effect -- completion of the tartan! \u00a0:D, The macro can take anywhere from 3.5 minutes to a half hour or more to run, depending on your processor (speed). The code could have been written to run quicker but it would have been less easy to understand. The line numbers are there to break up the code between different colors; a long section of code actually goes from what would be Line 841 to Line 870, typically. There are shorter sections where there were only single or double threads (otherwise, looping was used, so the max loop value for the last X03 of 5 means that there are 5+2 = 7 rows or threads in the last weft section of black. It is black because of Macro3 leaving the top cell of the 7 black. The first two rows have every other cell pasted from this origin cell; after that, the entire done rows are copied and pasted below per the X03 loop, which is much quicker. They are only done singly, however, as multiples would get confusing, given that the tartan is very inconsistent in how many threads per weft section there are, actually. That said, the macro is so very much faster than doing it manually, there is just No Comparison!!\n\n,","label":0,"model":"human","source":"wikihow","id":999}
